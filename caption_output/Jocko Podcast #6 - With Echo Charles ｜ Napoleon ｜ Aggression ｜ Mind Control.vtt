00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.20
This is Jocco podcast number six with Echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:11.20 --> 00:00:14.000
Time to get back to the books.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.48
Last time I read some letters and today we're going back to the books and actually this

4
00:00:22.48 --> 00:00:26.76
one is kind of hard pressed or it's a stretch to call this a book.

5
00:00:26.76 --> 00:00:34.92
But I've given some pretty, you know, the last hundred yards is a very rare piece of

6
00:00:34.92 --> 00:00:39.52
piece of literature if you could even call it that.

7
00:00:39.52 --> 00:00:41.76
Same with battle leadership.

8
00:00:41.76 --> 00:00:42.76
That's pretty rare.

9
00:00:42.76 --> 00:00:44.92
Now that one can be found on the internet.

10
00:00:44.92 --> 00:00:48.44
About face was a pretty popular book.

11
00:00:48.44 --> 00:00:56.52
But this one tonight we're going with something that many people have heard of or at a minimum.

12
00:00:56.52 --> 00:00:57.52
The word of Napoleon.

13
00:00:57.52 --> 00:00:58.52
Right?

14
00:00:58.52 --> 00:00:59.52
It's a very leader.

15
00:00:59.52 --> 00:01:05.76
But what's interesting about this and what's almost makes it cheating from my perspective

16
00:01:05.76 --> 00:01:08.20
for me is that these are maximums.

17
00:01:08.20 --> 00:01:12.24
These are already parsed down and put into a format.

18
00:01:12.24 --> 00:01:13.84
That's very easy to understand.

19
00:01:13.84 --> 00:01:18.000
You know, the work has already been done.

20
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.04
And I'll tell you, it is hard for me to find books or pieces of information to do this

21
00:01:27.04 --> 00:01:28.36
with.

22
00:01:28.36 --> 00:01:37.44
And part of the reason is it takes a, it takes, I'm looking for something very specific.

23
00:01:37.44 --> 00:01:38.44
Right?

24
00:01:38.44 --> 00:01:44.40
And it's not, you know, there's a lot of, there's tons of great books about war and they

25
00:01:44.40 --> 00:01:46.20
are about war.

26
00:01:46.20 --> 00:01:54.04
What happened and how the war happened and what tactics were used and what unit moved

27
00:01:54.04 --> 00:01:59.12
where and how many people they killed and how many maneuvers they did.

28
00:01:59.12 --> 00:02:00.60
And so that's very interesting.

29
00:02:00.60 --> 00:02:02.80
And there's definitely lessons to be learned from that.

30
00:02:02.80 --> 00:02:08.36
And there is knowledge and there's knowledge inside of tactics.

31
00:02:08.36 --> 00:02:12.32
And you know, the most common one is like, if you talk about the flank, which is the most

32
00:02:12.32 --> 00:02:19.92
common tactic is, you know, if you're assaulting a target, you go straight on.

33
00:02:19.92 --> 00:02:22.92
And that's, that's a frontal assault.

34
00:02:22.92 --> 00:02:26.32
But then what you want to do is you want to swing around the outside and hit them from

35
00:02:26.32 --> 00:02:27.96
where they're not protecting themselves.

36
00:02:27.96 --> 00:02:30.56
So that's a tactic that can be applied to, you know, anything.

37
00:02:30.56 --> 00:02:32.56
It can be applied to a debate.

38
00:02:32.56 --> 00:02:34.36
It can be applied to jujitsu.

39
00:02:34.36 --> 00:02:38.24
It can be applied to business situations where you know you want to hit your competition

40
00:02:38.24 --> 00:02:39.24
where they aren't expecting it.

41
00:02:39.24 --> 00:02:40.24
So that's a flank.

42
00:02:40.24 --> 00:02:44.48
So there is knowledge to be gained from tactics for sure.

43
00:02:44.48 --> 00:02:49.84
But what I am always more interested in is the leadership.

44
00:02:49.84 --> 00:02:57.52
And the human psychology, you know, and that's why I love battle, battle leadership because

45
00:02:57.52 --> 00:03:03.000
that first chapter is battle field psychology.

46
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.68
And this is pre, you know, this is World War I.

47
00:03:06.68 --> 00:03:13.48
You know, there was no kind of foo foo new age, hay, feelings and what are people?

48
00:03:13.48 --> 00:03:14.96
No, all that stuff didn't exist.

49
00:03:14.96 --> 00:03:19.000
And here's this guy talking about battle field psychology.

50
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.36
But that's what I'm always interested in.

51
00:03:21.36 --> 00:03:22.68
That's what I want to explore.

52
00:03:22.68 --> 00:03:24.000
That's what I want to learn about.

53
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.44
That's what I want to compare my experiences to because, and I've said this before,

54
00:03:30.44 --> 00:03:37.76
and leadership is the most challenging of all endeavors and leading these human beings with

55
00:03:37.76 --> 00:03:43.92
all these variables is the most challenging and therefore the most rewarding.

56
00:03:43.92 --> 00:03:50.48
So while the tactics are important and you can gain from them, it's how the people react,

57
00:03:50.48 --> 00:03:57.12
what they do, where they go, those are the things that stand the test of time.

58
00:03:57.12 --> 00:03:59.56
And that's always what I'm looking for.

59
00:03:59.56 --> 00:04:12.88
So these kind of things are the things that allow you as a leader of other people to look

60
00:04:12.88 --> 00:04:15.52
at those examples and learn from them and gain from them.

61
00:04:15.52 --> 00:04:21.08
And there will be little changes and little adjustments and you can see that there's

62
00:04:21.08 --> 00:04:29.24
changes over time, but the basic principles no matter when you can always learn from them.

63
00:04:29.24 --> 00:04:35.24
And it's the same thing with the tactics like, for instance, when we were fighting in an

64
00:04:35.24 --> 00:04:40.48
Iraq and Afghanistan, then I did not fight in Afghanistan, but one of my good buddies

65
00:04:40.48 --> 00:04:47.04
that fought with me in Iraq, and we brought back a lot of tactics and learned a lot of

66
00:04:47.04 --> 00:04:51.48
lessons and he said, after we went to Afghanistan, he said, that's the same thing.

67
00:04:51.48 --> 00:04:56.48
And people say, it's totally different.

68
00:04:56.48 --> 00:05:02.56
And so he fought in both, and he says, yeah, in Iraq, where we weren't, in Ramadi,

69
00:05:02.56 --> 00:05:08.48
he goes in Ramadi, and in Iraq, it's streets and buildings.

70
00:05:08.48 --> 00:05:11.40
And you get the elevated positions on the buildings, and then you've got control over the

71
00:05:11.40 --> 00:05:16.92
streets, and he goes in Afghanistan, it's valleys and hills, and you get the elevated

72
00:05:16.92 --> 00:05:20.72
position on the hills, and it's pretty much the same thing.

73
00:05:20.72 --> 00:05:21.72
Are there differences?

74
00:05:21.72 --> 00:05:22.72
Absolutely.

75
00:05:22.72 --> 00:05:27.68
You know, but I'm saying the basic principles that he learned he was able to apply.

76
00:05:27.68 --> 00:05:33.52
And again, not that I don't always keep an open mind that things can change and things

77
00:05:33.52 --> 00:05:35.48
unexpected things will happen.

78
00:05:35.48 --> 00:05:40.56
But that's sort of where, you know, what I'm always looking for.

79
00:05:40.56 --> 00:05:47.96
So that's why there's a lot of war books that I love to read and read, but I don't take

80
00:05:47.96 --> 00:05:54.28
away the same types of lessons that I want to talk to people about.

81
00:05:54.28 --> 00:05:55.88
Or that I think people want to talk to about.

82
00:05:55.88 --> 00:05:57.20
It'd be a different program.

83
00:05:57.20 --> 00:05:58.20
It would be a different program.

84
00:05:58.20 --> 00:06:06.66
And maybe we should do a program that's aimed at, you know, military people that are

85
00:06:06.66 --> 00:06:11.92
concerned about tactics, because that is definitely something that I, that I kind of worshiped

86
00:06:11.92 --> 00:06:12.92
tactics.

87
00:06:12.92 --> 00:06:21.80
I love talking about tactics, but for the, for normal people and and for military leaders,

88
00:06:21.80 --> 00:06:30.52
learning about how people react is to me kind of what's important and what I like to

89
00:06:30.52 --> 00:06:31.52
explore.

90
00:06:31.52 --> 00:06:32.52
Right.

91
00:06:32.52 --> 00:06:34.52
So interesting.

92
00:06:34.52 --> 00:06:36.60
I had a couple of things about Napoleon.

93
00:06:36.60 --> 00:06:42.28
Everyone knows, you know, something about Napoleon.

94
00:06:42.28 --> 00:06:43.76
A couple of cool facts about him.

95
00:06:43.76 --> 00:06:48.04
And this is going into this book here, which, which the book is actually called Ruch of

96
00:06:48.04 --> 00:06:49.04
Strategy.

97
00:06:49.04 --> 00:06:53.20
It's got a bunch of different, bunch of different sections to it.

98
00:06:53.20 --> 00:06:57.68
And it's different leaders, different historical leaders throughout time.

99
00:06:57.68 --> 00:07:02.52
And this section on Napoleon, Napoleon, going into the book here, Napoleon fought more

100
00:07:02.52 --> 00:07:08.40
battles than Alexander Hannibal and Caesar combined.

101
00:07:08.40 --> 00:07:12.48
He is beyond any doubt the greatest of European soldiers.

102
00:07:12.48 --> 00:07:14.68
So pretty good lead in.

103
00:07:14.68 --> 00:07:16.92
We were talking about a guy with some knowledge.

104
00:07:16.92 --> 00:07:22.000
He astounded his opponents by the crushing rapidity of his battles.

105
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.36
He marched against the enemy and his plan of battle was a part of his plan of march.

106
00:07:28.36 --> 00:07:35.12
So he's a guy that used mobility and used the quickness in the pace to dictate how the battles

107
00:07:35.12 --> 00:07:36.96
were going to go.

108
00:07:36.96 --> 00:07:43.32
His tactical system or scheme of battle was based on a holding attack against the enemy's

109
00:07:43.32 --> 00:07:45.32
front to keep them occupied.

110
00:07:45.32 --> 00:07:50.20
A wide development or turning movement on the enemy's rear with a small force to spread

111
00:07:50.20 --> 00:07:53.56
dismay and confusion in the defenders ranks.

112
00:07:53.56 --> 00:07:55.88
And then the decisive though.

113
00:07:55.88 --> 00:07:57.20
So that's what we just talked about.

114
00:07:57.20 --> 00:07:59.20
He was sort of a master of the flank.

115
00:07:59.20 --> 00:08:00.88
Hey, I'm going to do a good assault.

116
00:08:00.88 --> 00:08:02.72
You're going to be paying attention to that.

117
00:08:02.72 --> 00:08:07.36
And then from the side or the rear or somewhere that you're not expecting, you're getting

118
00:08:07.36 --> 00:08:08.80
submitted.

119
00:08:08.80 --> 00:08:10.76
And that's what he did.

120
00:08:10.76 --> 00:08:16.000
Napoleon was the first great strategist of the Western world.

121
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.76
His battles were the result of his strategic movements and were carefully calculated.

122
00:08:22.76 --> 00:08:24.80
Very.

123
00:08:24.80 --> 00:08:30.20
I would say that anyone that associates anyone that thinks of Napoleon, thinks of him as

124
00:08:30.20 --> 00:08:34.60
a strategist and a great strategist.

125
00:08:34.60 --> 00:08:41.64
Now this collection of his maxims was published in Paris in 1827.

126
00:08:41.64 --> 00:08:46.48
And almost immediately was translated into German, English, Spanish, and Italian.

127
00:08:46.48 --> 00:08:52.76
Stonewall Jackson carried these maxims in his haversac throughout his campaign.

128
00:08:52.76 --> 00:09:00.28
This little volume states Colonel Henderson, who is Jackson's biography, contains a fairly

129
00:09:00.28 --> 00:09:09.72
complete exposition in Napoleon's own words of the grand principles of war.

130
00:09:09.72 --> 00:09:14.04
And then the person that actually compiled the maxims.

131
00:09:14.04 --> 00:09:22.28
And this is actually this is a statement that is very similar to what I started off talking

132
00:09:22.28 --> 00:09:25.16
about what I like to learn about.

133
00:09:25.16 --> 00:09:32.52
The art of war is susceptible of being considered under two titles, the one which rests

134
00:09:32.52 --> 00:09:38.96
entirely on the knowledge and genius of the commander, the other on matters of detail.

135
00:09:38.96 --> 00:09:42.08
Now, they're going to break that down a little bit further.

136
00:09:42.08 --> 00:09:51.40
The first is the same for all time, for all peoples, whatever arms with which they fight.

137
00:09:51.40 --> 00:09:57.72
On this it follows that the same principles have directed the great captains of all centuries.

138
00:09:57.72 --> 00:10:01.08
So that's what I like to read about.

139
00:10:01.08 --> 00:10:08.000
Those same principles that have directed the great captains of all centuries.

140
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Those basic principles and a lot of those have to do with human nature.

141
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.32
And then it goes on to say that the matters of detail and what he's talking about matters

142
00:10:16.32 --> 00:10:21.80
details he's talking about tactics on the contrary are subject to the influence of time,

143
00:10:21.80 --> 00:10:24.68
to the spirit of the people and the character of armor.

144
00:10:24.68 --> 00:10:29.52
And so that's when you change from having bone arrows to rifles to machine guns to bombs to

145
00:10:29.52 --> 00:10:30.36
whatever.

146
00:10:30.36 --> 00:10:35.000
And so there are drastic changes in those tactics.

147
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.04
And that's why while they interest me, and I always like to find a common thread in

148
00:10:41.04 --> 00:10:45.08
tactics and say, oh, I had the same thing that we do that they didn't war war one.

149
00:10:45.08 --> 00:10:47.68
We do that now or whatever.

150
00:10:47.68 --> 00:10:53.12
You know, I'm always looking to find that thread, but it's sometimes it can be hard to find.

151
00:10:53.12 --> 00:10:59.80
And sometimes it doesn't exist to any great degree whereas the way people act, the way

152
00:10:59.80 --> 00:11:07.84
human beings respond to combat situations, it doesn't change as much.

153
00:11:07.84 --> 00:11:14.84
Yeah, you would think if you go deep enough or fundamental enough that it's not surprising

154
00:11:14.84 --> 00:11:20.44
that it won't change because dealing with people in their needs and like almost on a biological

155
00:11:20.44 --> 00:11:25.88
level, like psychologically, a lot of times biologically, you know, preservation of life plays

156
00:11:25.88 --> 00:11:28.88
a big part.

157
00:11:28.88 --> 00:11:34.40
So yet technology can advance, even social stuff can advance, but that those fundamental

158
00:11:34.40 --> 00:11:36.08
needs typically see the same.

159
00:11:36.08 --> 00:11:38.92
And you're right, but if you think about this and we talked about this last time like

160
00:11:38.92 --> 00:11:46.52
with World War One, you know, these basic needs for survival, these men would just

161
00:11:46.52 --> 00:11:48.16
just through them out the window.

162
00:11:48.16 --> 00:11:51.72
I mean, it's just absolutely crazy.

163
00:11:51.72 --> 00:11:58.64
They disregarded that drive and just went over the top into hell and into machine gun

164
00:11:58.64 --> 00:11:59.64
fires.

165
00:11:59.64 --> 00:12:03.56
Does that kind of go along the lines with something that is still here in a big way

166
00:12:03.56 --> 00:12:07.12
where they kind of put their own personal needs?

167
00:12:07.12 --> 00:12:10.56
They're, you know, they're, they're need to survive personally.

168
00:12:10.56 --> 00:12:18.16
They put the need for their mission or their honor to survive.

169
00:12:18.16 --> 00:12:20.84
They put that in front of their need to survive personally.

170
00:12:20.84 --> 00:12:23.52
And that doesn't, that kind of translate even now.

171
00:12:23.52 --> 00:12:24.84
That's how, like, yes.

172
00:12:24.84 --> 00:12:31.52
Yes, I mean, I guess if we say that that's a normal human trait, which I don't know if

173
00:12:31.52 --> 00:12:35.20
it is or not, that I think it's something that gets learned.

174
00:12:35.20 --> 00:12:38.96
I don't think it's a inherent normal, normal trait.

175
00:12:38.96 --> 00:12:44.60
Unless you say, look, people have an inherent trait to make their tribe their family survive.

176
00:12:44.60 --> 00:12:45.60
Yeah.

177
00:12:45.60 --> 00:12:46.60
And maybe that's it.

178
00:12:46.60 --> 00:12:47.60
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

179
00:12:47.60 --> 00:12:48.60
That's exactly what I was going to say.

180
00:12:48.60 --> 00:12:54.12
So military culture, especially when you, when you deal with the elite, where doing a good

181
00:12:54.12 --> 00:13:02.20
job to put a lightly doing a good job is very important.

182
00:13:02.20 --> 00:13:06.84
You would think that that culture cultivates that need to put the mission in front of my own

183
00:13:06.84 --> 00:13:07.84
personal stuff.

184
00:13:07.84 --> 00:13:13.56
So, and so deep into that, that individual that it does most of the time Trump, they're

185
00:13:13.56 --> 00:13:14.56
need.

186
00:13:14.56 --> 00:13:15.56
Yeah, personally.

187
00:13:15.56 --> 00:13:18.56
You know what, you're right, and that thread actually we can go through all of

188
00:13:18.56 --> 00:13:26.24
history and find a thread of groups of people that sacrificed and put their mission

189
00:13:26.24 --> 00:13:28.24
or the group had to themselves.

190
00:13:28.24 --> 00:13:29.24
Yes.

191
00:13:29.24 --> 00:13:30.24
Yes.

192
00:13:30.24 --> 00:13:33.88
And then, especially with the 300 Spartans, I mean, that's a classic example.

193
00:13:33.88 --> 00:13:34.88
Yeah.

194
00:13:34.88 --> 00:13:39.16
And even if you thought and died for their country.

195
00:13:39.16 --> 00:13:40.16
Yeah.

196
00:13:40.16 --> 00:13:46.64
And even people who aren't in the military, we understand that that's how elite soldiers

197
00:13:46.64 --> 00:13:47.64
are.

198
00:13:47.64 --> 00:13:51.32
You know, we understand that, oh, yeah, they, they, that's an elite soldier, one who will

199
00:13:51.32 --> 00:13:54.76
put his life on the line for the mission for the country.

200
00:13:54.76 --> 00:13:56.36
We all understand that.

201
00:13:56.36 --> 00:14:02.92
And you use the term elite, but I will not use the term elite because I've seen every

202
00:14:02.92 --> 00:14:05.60
soldier who wouldn't be considered elite.

203
00:14:05.60 --> 00:14:06.60
Right.

204
00:14:06.60 --> 00:14:07.60
I've seen them all.

205
00:14:07.60 --> 00:14:08.60
Right.

206
00:14:08.60 --> 00:14:09.60
Do that.

207
00:14:09.60 --> 00:14:10.60
Yeah.

208
00:14:10.60 --> 00:14:11.60
Marines do that.

209
00:14:11.60 --> 00:14:17.36
And US Army soldiers and, and, you know, the, the, the, the, untrained reserveist

210
00:14:17.36 --> 00:14:21.64
that doesn't really, you know, hasn't been through the kind of training that we have

211
00:14:21.64 --> 00:14:23.40
at all, but they will have that.

212
00:14:23.40 --> 00:14:28.32
So it has nothing to do really with, which actually proves your point even more is that

213
00:14:28.32 --> 00:14:32.32
it doesn't even have to do with your level of training or you're so called being elite.

214
00:14:32.32 --> 00:14:33.32
Right.

215
00:14:33.32 --> 00:14:35.72
That has to do with your dedication to the mission and the people that are with you.

216
00:14:35.72 --> 00:14:36.72
So yeah.

217
00:14:36.72 --> 00:14:42.88
But yeah, I guess the better than better than a word than elite would be, I guess,

218
00:14:42.88 --> 00:14:45.56
just like a dedicated soldier, just soldier in general.

219
00:14:45.56 --> 00:14:46.56
Yes.

220
00:14:46.56 --> 00:14:49.76
So back to the book here.

221
00:14:49.76 --> 00:14:50.76
A plan.

222
00:14:50.76 --> 00:14:53.96
Because I will get into the maximums and I'm not, obviously, it'll do all of them.

223
00:14:53.96 --> 00:14:59.92
But I picked out the ones that I kind of fought have the most talk about human nature.

224
00:14:59.92 --> 00:15:05.44
But at the same time, also talk about from a leadership perspective planning execution,

225
00:15:05.44 --> 00:15:09.000
if they are important and they are universal, then I, I put them in here and this is kind

226
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.68
of one of them that I just talked about with planning.

227
00:15:11.68 --> 00:15:16.60
A plan of campaign should anticipate everything which the enemy can do and contain within

228
00:15:16.60 --> 00:15:20.72
itself the means of forwarding him.

229
00:15:20.72 --> 00:15:25.60
The means of campaign may be infinitely modified according to the circumstances.

230
00:15:25.60 --> 00:15:32.08
This is exactly what we heard on battle leadership from Vaughan Shell.

231
00:15:32.08 --> 00:15:33.08
Is that?

232
00:15:33.08 --> 00:15:35.24
So he just said, you know, the plan should anticipate everything.

233
00:15:35.24 --> 00:15:39.80
But then he goes on to say, plans of campaign may be infinitely modified according to the

234
00:15:39.80 --> 00:15:46.08
circumstances, the genius of the commander, the quality of the troops and its biography

235
00:15:46.08 --> 00:15:47.72
of the theater of war.

236
00:15:47.72 --> 00:15:51.60
So this is again a common thread that we hear all the time and that is you got to have

237
00:15:51.60 --> 00:15:53.72
adaptability and you've got to be.

238
00:15:53.72 --> 00:16:01.08
And one of the biggest hinderances to adaptability is ego is when you say, you know what, my

239
00:16:01.08 --> 00:16:02.56
plan is awesome.

240
00:16:02.56 --> 00:16:07.40
My plan is my plan is the best and I'm just going to ride my plan into the ground and take

241
00:16:07.40 --> 00:16:13.08
everyone down with me because I don't have the humility to admit that my plan went wrong,

242
00:16:13.08 --> 00:16:17.68
to admit that the enemy did something I didn't expect to admit that I have shortfalls

243
00:16:17.68 --> 00:16:21.48
with my troops or whatever the case may be and say, you know what, I need to adapt.

244
00:16:21.48 --> 00:16:27.92
I'm going to do it now.

245
00:16:27.92 --> 00:16:30.72
Next one.

246
00:16:30.72 --> 00:16:37.20
All wars should be systematic for every wars should have an aim and be conducted in conformity

247
00:16:37.20 --> 00:16:40.88
with the principles and rules of the art.

248
00:16:40.88 --> 00:16:46.68
Wars should be undertaken with forces corresponding to the magnitude of the obstacles that

249
00:16:46.68 --> 00:16:49.80
are to be anticipated.

250
00:16:49.80 --> 00:16:57.96
Now what caught me about that one was recently I got to ask a bunch of questions about

251
00:16:57.96 --> 00:17:03.24
the situation in Iraq and Syria and one of the things people want to throw out there because

252
00:17:03.24 --> 00:17:13.92
it's a catchy buzzword or group of buzzwords and that's you know boots on the ground and

253
00:17:13.92 --> 00:17:18.72
you're kept getting asked well how many boots on the ground do we need?

254
00:17:18.72 --> 00:17:21.76
How many troops do we need to put on the ground?

255
00:17:21.76 --> 00:17:27.72
My answer was the same every time which is we put as many troops on the ground as it takes

256
00:17:27.72 --> 00:17:32.12
to wind and to wind decisively and without question.

257
00:17:32.12 --> 00:17:38.64
That's how you go to war.

258
00:17:38.64 --> 00:17:48.000
Now this is another little maximum which I really like at the commencement of a campaign

259
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.76
the question whether to advance or not requires careful deliberation.

260
00:17:52.76 --> 00:17:59.76
So before you go into war you you carefully deliberate and this is something that I've

261
00:17:59.76 --> 00:18:08.32
been talking about lately when people think that because I'm a soldier because I'm a

262
00:18:08.32 --> 00:18:13.48
warrior that I want to go to war and I want my friends to go to war which is just a

263
00:18:13.48 --> 00:18:14.72
ridiculous statement.

264
00:18:14.72 --> 00:18:22.12
If there's anybody that understands the impact of war it's guys that have been to war.

265
00:18:22.12 --> 00:18:28.96
So this careful deliberation before you commence a campaign is exactly what should be

266
00:18:28.96 --> 00:18:32.64
done and then it goes on to say.

267
00:18:32.64 --> 00:18:39.12
But when you have once undertaken the offensive it should be maintained to the last

268
00:18:39.12 --> 00:18:45.52
extremity right that's commitment that is commitment.

269
00:18:45.52 --> 00:18:51.92
Now I will say this even on that and that's a beautiful thing you should maintain to the

270
00:18:51.92 --> 00:18:57.000
last extremity that's an extreme statement and I will tell you that you got to balance

271
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.04
that and you want to maintain that but what I just said is that you know if your plan

272
00:19:02.04 --> 00:19:05.84
isn't working you got to put your ego in check and figure out a new plan.

273
00:19:05.84 --> 00:19:10.28
So yeah you want to maintain it to the last extremity but just short of the last

274
00:19:10.28 --> 00:19:15.16
extremity is okay do an ego check and make sure you've got a good plan going.

275
00:19:15.16 --> 00:19:22.52
A retreat however skillful the maneuvers may be will always produce an injurious moral

276
00:19:22.52 --> 00:19:24.80
effect on the army.

277
00:19:24.80 --> 00:19:30.44
Since by losing chances of success yourself you throw them into the hands of the enemy.

278
00:19:30.44 --> 00:19:38.36
Besides retreats cost far more both in men and material than the most bloody engagements

279
00:19:38.36 --> 00:19:40.60
with this difference.

280
00:19:40.60 --> 00:19:46.12
That in battle the enemy loses nearly much as you while on retreat the loss is all on

281
00:19:46.12 --> 00:19:48.68
your side.

282
00:19:48.68 --> 00:19:55.84
Again a common thread that we talk about with Vaunchel with Hackworth in that is being on

283
00:19:55.84 --> 00:20:01.64
the offensive is good.

284
00:20:01.64 --> 00:20:08.88
Being on the offensive is always better than being on the defensive.

285
00:20:08.88 --> 00:20:16.60
This is another I hope I don't know what I'm saying this for every one of these maxons.

286
00:20:16.60 --> 00:20:21.60
But these are you know and it's not surprising that you do say this before each one of these

287
00:20:21.60 --> 00:20:26.000
maxons you go wow this is an impactful and this is important I've heard this before this is another

288
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.76
way of reinstating the same topic that we say all the time.

289
00:20:31.76 --> 00:20:36.88
A general should say to himself many times a day if the hostile army were to make his

290
00:20:36.88 --> 00:20:44.56
make its appearance in front on my right or on my left what should I do.

291
00:20:44.56 --> 00:20:51.20
And if he is embarrassed his arrangements are bad there is something wrong he must

292
00:20:51.20 --> 00:20:53.28
rectify his mistake.

293
00:20:53.28 --> 00:20:59.52
So this is the humility of constantly asking yourself okay if I got hit from the flank

294
00:20:59.52 --> 00:21:04.000
right now what would I do how would I handle it am I ready for that if I'm not ready for

295
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.60
how do I make that change so constantly assessing yourself seeing where you're at seeing

296
00:21:09.60 --> 00:21:18.80
how you're doing that's a common thread not just for war but for being a man and being a human

297
00:21:18.80 --> 00:21:24.32
being a woman being a being a person that's trying to be successful are you looking at looking

298
00:21:24.32 --> 00:21:29.28
around and you know things I'm always most nervous when things are going well when things are

299
00:21:29.28 --> 00:21:34.64
going well I'm always thinking okay when when is the bad thing going to come and hit me you know

300
00:21:34.64 --> 00:21:39.44
how do I prepare for that how do I watch out for it how do I flank that thing before happens to

301
00:21:39.44 --> 00:21:45.20
yeah a lot of times people will get in the in a way revel in the success right and then they'll get

302
00:21:45.20 --> 00:21:50.64
used to it it'll get good to them you used to it and then yeah one something does go bad or just

303
00:21:50.64 --> 00:21:55.44
different you're going to lie down and decide it yeah they're just so into that success and

304
00:21:55.44 --> 00:22:01.12
immersing themselves in in that success then yeah they didn't know what to do I was uh we my first

305
00:22:01.12 --> 00:22:10.64
deployment to Iraq we were doing assaults and capturing bad guys and we got a guy and then we went

306
00:22:10.64 --> 00:22:15.60
and got another guy right right on top of them we interrogated that guy we wouldn't go we broke down

307
00:22:15.60 --> 00:22:23.60
some sell and my commanding officer at the time he came to me he said hey jokko that those you

308
00:22:23.60 --> 00:22:31.20
know I think it was four missions in a row within 24 hour period and he said hey those operations

309
00:22:31.20 --> 00:22:35.92
that was awesome awesome work you know tell your platoon they did a great job getting the

310
00:22:35.92 --> 00:22:41.76
information going back out there quick planning cycle it was just fantastic you know those are

311
00:22:41.76 --> 00:22:48.40
very admirable and I just looked into my said give us 24 hours and we'll screw it up and I just

312
00:22:48.40 --> 00:22:53.44
you don't want to set expectations that's how that's how that's too avoid what you were talking

313
00:22:53.44 --> 00:22:58.24
about to avoid be like that's right you know I said no you know what sir give us 24 hours and

314
00:22:58.24 --> 00:23:04.80
we'll screw it up right do you ever fear like in the we're in that particular case that um he could

315
00:23:04.80 --> 00:23:10.80
look at at it as dang are you being negative or because obviously you're not given what you're saying

316
00:23:10.80 --> 00:23:15.36
you're not being negative you're checking yourself the whole time and but do you fear that that

317
00:23:15.36 --> 00:23:19.12
either hand but either you're commanding officer or anyone would take that as dang this guy's

318
00:23:19.12 --> 00:23:24.72
a person there something like that no I had a good great relationship with my with all my

319
00:23:24.72 --> 00:23:28.88
commanding officers you know why we say that's my responsibility you have a great relationship with

320
00:23:28.88 --> 00:23:32.56
these guys and so he knew that I was just being humble and making sure that we're not good

321
00:23:32.56 --> 00:23:36.64
talking even though he was trying to fire me up and you know he's probably trying to do that

322
00:23:36.64 --> 00:23:40.32
because everyone was kind of burned out I mean from doing staying awake for a long period of time

323
00:23:40.32 --> 00:23:45.20
and doing a bunch of hobs and he was just trying to you know give some compliments and yeah I just said

324
00:23:45.20 --> 00:23:50.96
hey sir you know let's not let's not get crazy here yeah long deployment ahead of us still so

325
00:23:52.32 --> 00:23:55.84
you gotta be careful about

326
00:23:55.84 --> 00:24:08.16
to operate upon lines remote from each other and without communications between them is a

327
00:24:08.16 --> 00:24:16.48
fault which ordinarily occasions a second the detached column has orders only for the first day

328
00:24:17.12 --> 00:24:21.36
its operations for the second day may depend on what has happened to the main body

329
00:24:21.36 --> 00:24:28.24
thus according to circumstances the column wasted time in waiting for orders or acts randomly

330
00:24:30.08 --> 00:24:36.000
so what that means is you've got multiple elements out there and you've got the main element

331
00:24:36.80 --> 00:24:41.36
and whoever breaks off from that main element they might know what to do the first day

332
00:24:41.92 --> 00:24:46.88
but what do they do the second day and this is just going into classic decentralized command

333
00:24:46.88 --> 00:24:53.76
because in reality today in today's world this rarely happens where we lose total communications

334
00:24:53.76 --> 00:24:57.76
and in the business world I mean I'm a text away you can literally talk to me

335
00:24:57.76 --> 00:25:05.60
at instantaneously but there's there's times in combat and in the business world and in life

336
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.08
where instantaneously isn't fast enough you know it is not fast enough when we talk about this

337
00:25:10.08 --> 00:25:17.92
with decentralized command if you know you get ambushed and you don't know what you're supposed to do

338
00:25:17.92 --> 00:25:22.72
as a commander when you get ambushed you don't have a plan you don't have an overall strategy

339
00:25:23.12 --> 00:25:27.20
then what do you gonna call back to higher headquarters and say hey jocca we're getting ambushed right now

340
00:25:27.20 --> 00:25:33.28
what do you want me to do no I've you you gotta be out there in the field with the with the commanders

341
00:25:33.28 --> 00:25:37.76
intent that you know what what you're supposed to do and you know that if you get ambushed here

342
00:25:37.76 --> 00:25:41.20
which you're gonna do you're gonna break contact or you're gonna you know flank the enemy

343
00:25:41.20 --> 00:25:48.000
or whatever the case may be but you're gonna know what to do in a business environment it's the same thing

344
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.92
there's times where instant communication isn't fast enough you know I actually see this

345
00:25:53.92 --> 00:26:01.28
when we work with like sales people and you know there'll be some hierarchy of adjusting

346
00:26:02.08 --> 00:26:06.80
product pricing and you know a client will come in or a customer will come in

347
00:26:06.80 --> 00:26:13.76
and and if that person if that front line sales person doesn't have the ability to make a

348
00:26:13.76 --> 00:26:18.88
pricing decision on the spot and say you know what sir I see you you know you've you've shopped

349
00:26:18.88 --> 00:26:23.84
us around and this is the deal you've got over there I can do here I can take care of you we can

350
00:26:23.84 --> 00:26:27.84
beat that price if you can't do that he's gonna lose you know if he goes let me check with my

351
00:26:27.84 --> 00:26:33.28
manager sure he could hang on to but there's a chance he's gonna lose him so sometimes instantaneous

352
00:26:33.28 --> 00:26:38.96
isn't fast enough you know it's gotta be it's gotta be quicker it's gotta be able to happen

353
00:26:38.96 --> 00:26:45.52
with no communications and that's that's what this is referring to it ought it ought then

354
00:26:46.32 --> 00:26:50.72
to be adopted as a principle that the columns of an army should always be kept united

355
00:26:50.72 --> 00:26:53.52
so that when the enemy cannot thrust themselves between them

356
00:26:53.52 --> 00:27:04.64
this is something that I always preached to my seal leadership and that is that

357
00:27:05.76 --> 00:27:09.84
separating your forces and sometimes you do have to do it and it's and it's a completely

358
00:27:09.84 --> 00:27:17.92
acceptable tactic but it's always better to be unified it's always better to be close enough

359
00:27:17.92 --> 00:27:23.20
that you can in fact you can be separate but you know you always need to be close enough to each other

360
00:27:23.20 --> 00:27:28.96
to support each other so if you know you shouldn't be getting you're you and your element shouldn't

361
00:27:28.96 --> 00:27:33.04
be getting any further away from me in my element then we could be able to support you so what's

362
00:27:33.04 --> 00:27:37.52
the range of my guns what's the accurate range of my guns you know if I can shoot three or four

363
00:27:37.52 --> 00:27:42.88
hundred five hundred meters you know if you have eight guys now I have eight guys and now we're

364
00:27:42.88 --> 00:27:47.12
getting further than that apart that means I really can't support you so now we're alone

365
00:27:48.24 --> 00:27:52.72
and that's not how you want to be so again there's times where people have to take calculated

366
00:27:52.72 --> 00:28:02.56
risks but we always would say you know keep that keep together stay together as much as you can

367
00:28:03.44 --> 00:28:08.80
and and again this is it I'm I'm talking tactics now this is like for people that are in the military

368
00:28:08.80 --> 00:28:13.84
that are listening to this podcast there's something to keep in the back of your mind stay where you

369
00:28:13.84 --> 00:28:17.44
can cover and move stay where you can mutually support one another

370
00:28:17.44 --> 00:28:28.08
hmm they should move oh when for any reason this maximum is departed from the detach core

371
00:28:28.08 --> 00:28:33.44
should be independent in their operations they should move towards a fixed point at which they are

372
00:28:33.44 --> 00:28:39.36
you to unite they should march without hesitation and without new orders and should be exposed as

373
00:28:39.36 --> 00:28:43.84
little as possible to the danger being attacked separately this to me goes into contingencies

374
00:28:43.84 --> 00:28:49.44
where if we do get separated you've got to know okay if I get separated and it's been an hour

375
00:28:49.44 --> 00:28:52.88
I'm going to this fixed point and we're gonna make it happen yeah that's something you're at the

376
00:28:52.88 --> 00:28:57.12
mall yeah I was just gonna say when you got a family this is something you actually have to legit come

377
00:28:57.12 --> 00:29:00.88
up with okay if we get separated here's what I'm meeting here's what time and by the way if we don't

378
00:29:00.88 --> 00:29:05.12
make that muster for whatever reason the next one will be here and so you got to have a little

379
00:29:05.12 --> 00:29:11.60
contingency planning with the fam make sure it's all good what is muster me muster means bringing

380
00:29:11.60 --> 00:29:17.28
everyone together and counts how many people you have I'm gonna say that next time yeah say

381
00:29:17.28 --> 00:29:28.16
mustard is that so and so next one a well established maximum for is not to do anything

382
00:29:28.16 --> 00:29:35.12
which your enemy wishes and for the single reason that he does so wish okay that is pretty

383
00:29:35.84 --> 00:29:41.52
self explanatory don't do anything that your enemy wants you to do you should therefore

384
00:29:41.52 --> 00:29:49.60
avoid a field of battle which he is reconnoidered and studied you should still you should be

385
00:29:49.60 --> 00:29:55.44
still more careful to avoid one which he has fortified and where he has entrenched himself

386
00:29:58.40 --> 00:30:07.12
a corollary of this principle is never to attack in front a position which admits of being turned

387
00:30:07.12 --> 00:30:15.20
so one of the one of the the biggest pieces that I take away from this and this is you should

388
00:30:15.20 --> 00:30:20.80
still be more careful to avoid one which he has fortified and where he hasn't entrenched himself

389
00:30:22.56 --> 00:30:31.20
I used to give my guys warnings about this about these fixed positions that are entrenched

390
00:30:31.20 --> 00:30:38.24
and I wasn't talking about combat you know what I was talking about I was talking about debates

391
00:30:38.24 --> 00:30:48.08
because you there's guys in the seal teams that would lure you into some kind of a debate about

392
00:30:49.76 --> 00:30:55.52
let's say the strategy that the seal teams were using at the strategy the way things that

393
00:30:55.52 --> 00:31:03.36
they the way they thought things should be done and the thing is these guys would sit there

394
00:31:03.36 --> 00:31:08.24
and have this argument with amongst themselves and with other people and so they would they would

395
00:31:08.24 --> 00:31:13.60
have these kind of fortified positions on them and you roll into it and you're like you've got your

396
00:31:13.60 --> 00:31:18.80
experience but you're not ready for a debate on it you're not ready for these fortified positions

397
00:31:18.80 --> 00:31:24.80
that you're going to throw at you so don't engage in these battles and you know it's like

398
00:31:24.80 --> 00:31:33.28
I was doing Sam Harris's podcast you know and I went up there and there were some things that

399
00:31:33.28 --> 00:31:39.92
I thought you know he might ask me about some of these philosophical opinions on things and of course

400
00:31:39.92 --> 00:31:46.56
I mean I was ready to have a discussion but what I wasn't ready to do was like stand my ground

401
00:31:46.56 --> 00:31:55.12
on the topic of free will with Sam Harris a guy that's literally written an entire block which is

402
00:31:55.12 --> 00:32:00.80
called free will and he has his own so for me to engage with him it's an entrenched position it's

403
00:32:00.80 --> 00:32:08.24
something that I'm not going to I'm not going to win and in fact you know it's not it's not like

404
00:32:08.24 --> 00:32:12.96
Sam Harris is a pretty mellow guy it's not going to go to the government but I wasn't going to

405
00:32:12.96 --> 00:32:19.44
make any practical points you know and so I'm just always very cautious and again in the business

406
00:32:19.44 --> 00:32:27.36
world you get people that understand some part of their business so well you have to be very careful

407
00:32:27.36 --> 00:32:33.68
you have to plan when you're going to engage with them because otherwise you're going to get just

408
00:32:33.68 --> 00:32:42.48
you know destroyed mm-hmm yeah Sam Harris is a position on free will is pretty fortified

409
00:32:42.48 --> 00:32:49.44
out yeah and it's and and and the scary thing is is that you can actually be right about something

410
00:32:49.44 --> 00:32:54.16
but if you're going to get someone that's got a fortified position you can still lose the argument

411
00:32:54.16 --> 00:32:58.56
and look stupid not that there's anything wrong with looking stupid but you know you want to pick

412
00:32:58.56 --> 00:33:03.84
your battles I mean right yeah not that Sam Harris isn't right or anything like that

413
00:33:04.72 --> 00:33:09.52
yeah I'm the same in general yeah no no no I wasn't definitely wasn't talking specifically about

414
00:33:09.52 --> 00:33:14.32
about Sam Harris that's just a great example because again it's a guy that's literally written a book

415
00:33:15.20 --> 00:33:20.88
called free will yeah so if he wants to talk about it and I want to say no I don't agree with you

416
00:33:20.88 --> 00:33:25.92
he's just ready for that you know just like if he reset you know what hey let's let's train

417
00:33:25.92 --> 00:33:31.20
you jutsu I'm ready for that I've been in every position that that's going to happen in jutsu

418
00:33:31.20 --> 00:33:36.48
I've been in there a thousand more times than him yeah because I've been training for a really long time

419
00:33:36.48 --> 00:33:40.72
so we have that discussion about free will it's going to be the same thing I'm just not going to

420
00:33:40.72 --> 00:33:46.56
we have this thing to the table is that kind of like the guys who who are really into conspiracy theories

421
00:33:46.56 --> 00:33:51.44
you know and they if they present it to you they're going to have all this research and website

422
00:33:51.44 --> 00:33:56.40
and documentaries that they went to and you're you know yeah even even if your facts are like

423
00:33:56.40 --> 00:34:00.32
stronger they have so many other weapons and they're ready for that war they're ready for their

424
00:34:00.32 --> 00:34:07.52
lunch and fortified like are you're saying yeah yeah that's a hard word to win yeah because I'm

425
00:34:07.52 --> 00:34:12.000
not going to go like we've talked about before I'm not going to go and dig through the interwebs

426
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.80
and watch video upon video about just to fight that war just to fight to it's not even necessarily

427
00:34:16.80 --> 00:34:23.28
to prove anything right or right it's just you got just to fight and win that war yeah the passage

428
00:34:23.28 --> 00:34:30.64
from the defensive to the offensive is one of the most delicate operations of war and I actually have

429
00:34:30.64 --> 00:34:38.48
a note of what I think is the most difficult operation of war and that is linking up under fire

430
00:34:39.36 --> 00:34:46.64
and again you know what now I'm talking tactically to two two people that are listening to the

431
00:34:46.64 --> 00:34:52.64
show that are currently serving in the military in the police linking up with other units

432
00:34:52.64 --> 00:34:57.76
other from the units under fire is one of the most difficult things to do because there's so much

433
00:34:57.76 --> 00:35:03.52
confusion people are shooting you're trying to bring friendly units together there can be bad

434
00:35:03.52 --> 00:35:07.92
guys in between you and obviously if there's bad guys in between you and the other good guys and

435
00:35:07.92 --> 00:35:12.80
you have to shoot at the bad guys that means you're shooting at good guys too your bullets can hit them

436
00:35:12.80 --> 00:35:20.16
so it's a very very very challenging thing to do so be careful when it comes time to link up

437
00:35:20.16 --> 00:35:38.32
under fire and you know what I think of when I think of this I think of when you see companies

438
00:35:38.32 --> 00:35:47.68
merge it's they're you know they're they're moving together and there's just it's a very

439
00:35:47.68 --> 00:35:56.56
challenging there's confusion there's a disorder there's a there's a merging of the chain of

440
00:35:56.56 --> 00:36:02.72
commands of two different groups so it's it's very challenging and so anybody that's going into

441
00:36:02.72 --> 00:36:06.88
some kind of a merger scenario you've got to recognize out of the gate that this is one of the

442
00:36:06.88 --> 00:36:11.28
most hardest military operations and one of the hardest business operations to do so you've got

443
00:36:11.28 --> 00:36:16.000
to be aggressive with it you've got to plan it you've got to be clear about it you've got to do it

444
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.24
in a simple way don't think that you're just gonna merge two companies together and it's

445
00:36:22.24 --> 00:36:26.24
going to be all good it's a very challenging event to participate in.

446
00:36:35.20 --> 00:36:42.96
It is a violation of correct principles to cause cores to act separately without communication

447
00:36:42.96 --> 00:36:49.28
with each other in the face of a concentrated army with easy communications.

448
00:36:51.36 --> 00:36:58.80
This is the same theme this idea that you want to stay together you want to work together you want

449
00:36:58.80 --> 00:37:03.28
to and I'll fill this word out there in case people didn't catch the first time I said it the word

450
00:37:03.28 --> 00:37:07.92
mutually support or the words mutually support you want to mutually support each other.

451
00:37:07.92 --> 00:37:14.000
Now what we find in the business world is you get different elements inside of a company

452
00:37:14.56 --> 00:37:20.32
that do not work together they don't communicate with each other and it's the same thing as

453
00:37:20.32 --> 00:37:24.72
being out on the battlefield and you got your platoon and I got my platoon and if we're not talking

454
00:37:25.44 --> 00:37:31.28
how are we helping each other it's we're not and if we if you try and hit the enemy

455
00:37:32.40 --> 00:37:37.04
and the enemy's bigger and stronger than than you are alone he's going to beat you and then if I

456
00:37:37.04 --> 00:37:42.08
try and you know later even if it's an hour later I try and hit him well guess what he's

457
00:37:42.08 --> 00:37:44.72
bigger and stronger than you and he's bigger and stronger than me he's going to beat me we

458
00:37:44.72 --> 00:37:49.12
have to join together work together it's so obvious I know it's obvious and you know what you

459
00:37:49.12 --> 00:37:54.08
would think it'd be obvious to people on the battlefield and yet Napoleon himself felt the need

460
00:37:54.08 --> 00:37:58.40
to write that down as a maximum because people don't do it and and and and lay for

461
00:37:58.40 --> 00:38:03.76
an eye in in our book we have the the law of combat called cover move and that's what it is

462
00:38:03.76 --> 00:38:08.88
about mutual support it's about working together it's about teamwork and it's about not having

463
00:38:08.88 --> 00:38:16.000
silos in your organization where one person just is going to be on their own or one element on

464
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.92
their own or other elements on their own or other elements on their own are you talking about

465
00:38:19.92 --> 00:38:25.44
like just structurally where that's how you kind of run the business or are you talking about where

466
00:38:25.44 --> 00:38:29.68
they don't communicate because I don't really like that guy it's both us oh and now what will

467
00:38:29.68 --> 00:38:34.80
structurally mean you have to have things structurally there will be separate elements structurally

468
00:38:34.80 --> 00:38:41.28
in the military the military there's you know there's artillery that's a separate element there's

469
00:38:41.28 --> 00:38:32.80
you know logistics that's a separate element you've got then you've got the the infantry

470
00:38:47.44 --> 00:38:51.36
companies and there'll be separate infantry companies but they're all separate but they have

471
00:38:51.36 --> 00:38:55.20
to work together they have to mutually support they have to communicate they fail to do that

472
00:38:55.20 --> 00:38:58.32
well in a business you've got the same thing you've got a sales branch you've got in

473
00:38:58.32 --> 00:39:05.28
operational branch you've got an administrative branch you've got a marketing branch and all those branches they have to work together too

474
00:39:06.28 --> 00:39:08.28
Yeah, so and

475
00:39:08.28 --> 00:39:10.28
on a personal level let's say

476
00:39:10.88 --> 00:39:12.88
you know, I don't like

477
00:39:13.16 --> 00:39:15.16
Jenny from HR

478
00:39:15.16 --> 00:39:17.66
So I can't stand Jenny from HR

479
00:39:17.66 --> 00:39:22.40
Yeah, so so we're not gonna we're not gonna talk to her. You know, we're just we don't need her

480
00:39:22.40 --> 00:39:25.52
You know, we're just gonna continue without her kind of kind of attitude

481
00:39:25.52 --> 00:39:29.08
Yes, that's a classic example if

482
00:39:29.68 --> 00:39:36.60
Anyone decides that for personal reasons or whatever they're not gonna work with someone else that's exactly what I'm talking about and it does happen in

483
00:39:39.08 --> 00:39:44.16
It happens so often in businesses. It's ridiculous and it happens in the military too

484
00:39:44.16 --> 00:39:48.16
It happens in sea will platoons. It happens in inter-services and

485
00:39:48.48 --> 00:39:51.88
And that's just a huge obstacle to overcome and like I said that's why

486
00:39:51.88 --> 00:39:55.80
Napoleon bone apart himself put it in his maximums

487
00:39:58.92 --> 00:40:00.92
Another one one battalion

488
00:40:01.72 --> 00:40:04.72
Sometimes decides the issue of the day

489
00:40:06.44 --> 00:40:13.68
So which battalion is that gonna be we don't know which element is gonna hit that critical situation

490
00:40:14.04 --> 00:40:18.80
This to me is bringing it back to you know being prepared and giving you know

491
00:40:18.80 --> 00:40:29.26
Making your teams strong all of them in balancing them because one battalion or one element or one team or maybe even one person can

492
00:40:29.88 --> 00:40:34.22
Decide the issue of the day so balance is very important

493
00:40:39.12 --> 00:40:46.000
I just couldn't help just going tactical with Napoleon on some of these I really couldn't it's just great stuff

494
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
I understand

495
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:55.22
It should be adopted as a principle never to allow intervals through which the enemy can penetrate between the different cores

496
00:40:55.32 --> 00:40:59.04
Fawning the forming the line of battle unless you have laid a snare

497
00:41:00.12 --> 00:41:02.62
Into which it is your object to draw him

498
00:41:04.52 --> 00:41:11.16
This is very simple for people that are in the military to understand and I just kind of talked about it if you and I are the good guys

499
00:41:11.16 --> 00:41:19.000
And we have guns just you and me and we allow a bad guy to get in between you and me and he has a gun

500
00:41:19.68 --> 00:41:22.68
Now what is that do you do you understand?

501
00:41:23.04 --> 00:41:28.32
What that does if I want to shoot the guy and I mess by a quarter of an inch who does it hit?

502
00:41:28.32 --> 00:41:34.06
Right potentially me it hits you. Yeah, it hits you because it's Murphy's law not even it potentially it will hit you

503
00:41:34.06 --> 00:41:40.30
It's Murphy's law so you want to always again the scores back to you know unity of command and

504
00:41:40.30 --> 00:41:46.90
Having your elements working together and not allowing other elements to penetrate in between

505
00:41:47.26 --> 00:41:55.86
Your forces interesting how he added unless it's to snare him like unless that's like that you're baiting them into a trap kind of thing

506
00:41:56.22 --> 00:42:01.14
That's interesting how he added that specifically like that's kind of a dope little thing to do yeah

507
00:42:01.14 --> 00:42:07.34
It is it I don't know if Napoleon would have said it was a dope little thing to do but

508
00:42:07.34 --> 00:42:20.86
But it kind of is though that's a thing and this is the next one same theme the camps of the same army should always be so placed as to be able to sustain each other

509
00:42:21.78 --> 00:42:25.34
Right you always have to be able to mutually support

510
00:42:25.34 --> 00:42:35.18
Mm-hmm mutually support as you would say that is important a

511
00:42:43.70 --> 00:42:49.78
Good general good officers commissioned and non-commissioned good organization

512
00:42:49.78 --> 00:42:58.14
Good instruction and strict discipline make good troops independently of the cause for which they are fighting

513
00:43:01.94 --> 00:43:08.04
Independently of the cause for which they're fighting a good general good officers commissioned and non-commissioned good

514
00:43:08.04 --> 00:43:14.42
Organization good instruction and strict discipline make good troops independent of the cause for which they're fighting

515
00:43:14.42 --> 00:43:19.42
So you can actually just have a

516
00:43:20.54 --> 00:43:25.82
Incredibly strong force that can operate at a high level

517
00:43:27.34 --> 00:43:32.02
Regardless of the cost that they're fighting for just because they have those things

518
00:43:34.14 --> 00:43:38.18
Yeah, like kind of what I told you before where if you you know you were

519
00:43:38.18 --> 00:43:45.62
Trained in discipline trained in all these things all the way down to just okay for example if you if you were trained in

520
00:43:46.38 --> 00:43:50.10
By whatever means you're trained to show up on time every single time

521
00:43:50.70 --> 00:43:52.70
Where you

522
00:43:52.70 --> 00:44:01.02
You know never be late. Yeah, to the point where being late could very well be the end of the world for you like train that hard and never being late

523
00:44:02.62 --> 00:44:05.78
That's gonna for a certain situation like you're in the military

524
00:44:05.78 --> 00:44:08.26
Right, so you can never be late in the military so now when you get out

525
00:44:09.06 --> 00:44:12.98
When you show up for work when you show up for drinks with your friend

526
00:44:13.82 --> 00:44:20.50
Chances aren't you're never gonna be late of course and that goes for you know the skills the discipline and everything else you're trained in

527
00:44:20.94 --> 00:44:22.94
Yeah

528
00:44:24.46 --> 00:44:28.22
The first quality and this is now we're just gonna get after it

529
00:44:29.30 --> 00:44:32.78
the first quality of a soldier is

530
00:44:32.78 --> 00:44:37.06
Constancy in enduring fatigue and hardship

531
00:44:38.66 --> 00:44:40.66
Courage is only the second

532
00:44:45.14 --> 00:44:48.26
So the first quality of a soldier is

533
00:44:48.46 --> 00:44:53.30
Constancy in enduring fatigue and hardship that is the this is Napoleon Bonaparte

534
00:44:53.90 --> 00:44:59.86
Saying that the most important thing the most important quality of a soldier is that they that they can endure

535
00:44:59.86 --> 00:45:01.86
fatigue and hardship

536
00:45:03.26 --> 00:45:06.46
Courage is only second poverty

537
00:45:07.10 --> 00:45:11.94
privation and want are the school of the good soldier

538
00:45:13.14 --> 00:45:19.18
So now when you look at any of the elite military training

539
00:45:21.02 --> 00:45:23.02
Schools that

540
00:45:23.22 --> 00:45:28.02
Those get that people could put through. Well, what is it about it's about poverty?

541
00:45:28.02 --> 00:45:34.82
Privation and want you know, it's about being hungry cold tired miserable. That's what they do

542
00:45:35.54 --> 00:45:37.54
You know, privation

543
00:45:37.54 --> 00:45:40.82
I look that word up actually a state in which

544
00:45:41.86 --> 00:45:45.50
Things that are essential for human well being are lacking

545
00:45:46.70 --> 00:45:48.70
And that's what they do and

546
00:45:48.94 --> 00:45:50.94
You know for me

547
00:45:50.94 --> 00:45:57.70
You know, I was talking about like you know, I don't sleep a lot awake up early. That's one of those things that it was pretty natural to me luckily

548
00:45:57.70 --> 00:45:59.70
There's some biological

549
00:45:59.70 --> 00:46:01.70
Genetic reason or whatever

550
00:46:01.70 --> 00:46:07.54
But that was very helpful to me very helpful for me to not have to sleep a lot

551
00:46:07.54 --> 00:46:08.54
Yeah

552
00:46:08.54 --> 00:46:11.54
And being able to suffer through that well

553
00:46:12.38 --> 00:46:13.38
was

554
00:46:13.38 --> 00:46:15.38
Was beneficial and

555
00:46:15.38 --> 00:46:21.30
You know, there's a lot of guys that have that that talent and people that don't have that talent have a rough time. Yeah as

556
00:46:22.70 --> 00:46:25.82
You know as warriors in real sense

557
00:46:29.86 --> 00:46:31.14
You should

558
00:46:31.14 --> 00:46:35.26
By all means encourage the soldiers to continue in the service

559
00:46:36.46 --> 00:46:40.70
This you can easily do by testifying greatest team for old soldiers

560
00:46:41.18 --> 00:46:44.06
They do that very well in the military. You know the older

561
00:46:44.06 --> 00:46:47.86
More experienced veteran soldiers get a lot of respect

562
00:46:48.38 --> 00:46:51.82
The pay should also be increased in proportion to the years in service

563
00:46:52.74 --> 00:46:58.18
There's a great injustice in having no higher pay to a veteran than to a crew. So that's

564
00:46:59.54 --> 00:47:06.66
That's good. Now when I read this this didn't particularly strike me as an important maximum to bring up

565
00:47:06.66 --> 00:47:08.66
But it reminded me of a story

566
00:47:09.70 --> 00:47:12.70
That always stuck with me and

567
00:47:12.70 --> 00:47:20.74
And so I was over in Ramadi and I was working with a with the battalion called the first of the 506 band of brothers

568
00:47:22.06 --> 00:47:24.06
Red curry just

569
00:47:24.70 --> 00:47:28.26
unbelievably awesome and our heroic

570
00:47:29.26 --> 00:47:33.94
Soldiers and I went over there for a meeting

571
00:47:35.14 --> 00:47:38.34
With the commander of the battalion and I

572
00:47:38.34 --> 00:47:43.82
I showed up to the meeting early of course. I was meeting him in his office, but and this guy was

573
00:47:44.66 --> 00:47:46.98
Was just an incredible leader and

574
00:47:48.18 --> 00:47:51.26
An incredible soldier and really an incredible man

575
00:47:52.82 --> 00:47:56.50
That I could not have any more respect for and

576
00:47:58.06 --> 00:48:02.90
You know, I'm not saying his name right now because I don't want to interrupt his privacy in his world

577
00:48:03.42 --> 00:48:06.86
You know, I don't know if he wants to have his name set on a podcast

578
00:48:06.86 --> 00:48:10.66
You know and we talk about him in the book and I don't put his name in there either and again

579
00:48:10.66 --> 00:48:13.86
This is out of respect for people's privacy and also out of

580
00:48:15.58 --> 00:48:19.30
You know security reasons you know he doesn't want to have the

581
00:48:20.66 --> 00:48:23.50
Insurgents and terrorists of the world knowing that he was this guy. So

582
00:48:24.06 --> 00:48:26.66
But I will tell you this the guy was just a fantastic leader and

583
00:48:28.18 --> 00:48:32.14
So I went to this meeting with him. There's just a one on one meeting. I forget what we were talking about

584
00:48:32.14 --> 00:48:37.36
But I showed up early and he's in there and I can hear him, you know, he's kind of talking to a soldier. I can't hear what he's saying

585
00:48:37.52 --> 00:48:43.42
And there's just a soldier and what's interesting about this is these the army seeing the seal teams when you go

586
00:48:43.54 --> 00:48:47.26
When you join a seal platoon for two years or whatever

587
00:48:47.26 --> 00:48:50.30
How however long it's gonna be you stay in that seal platoon

588
00:48:50.46 --> 00:48:54.36
You do a workup cycle and then you go out on deployment and

589
00:48:54.36 --> 00:48:56.36
and

590
00:48:59.88 --> 00:49:02.84
The army does a little bit differently the army you could be

591
00:49:03.80 --> 00:49:06.92
Three months into a year long deployment to Iraq and

592
00:49:08.04 --> 00:49:09.80
They will just

593
00:49:09.80 --> 00:49:13.90
They'll just leave they'll there'll be their time their time and the army is up and they'll go home or

594
00:49:14.76 --> 00:49:18.44
And then some new guy will show up and they'll be the middle deployment and that's how they do it

595
00:49:18.44 --> 00:49:23.48
The seal team doesn't really do that. You know, you kind of stick together for an entire straight six or seven month deployment

596
00:49:23.48 --> 00:49:30.28
So I showed up this meeting with the battalion commander and

597
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.64
The soldier that was in before me walks out and

598
00:49:36.32 --> 00:49:40.92
The Colonel I sat down and said hey sir, are you doing good to see you? He's like hey good to see you frogman

599
00:49:41.64 --> 00:49:47.76
And he said you know that right there's a soldier's getting out of the army and I said oh

600
00:49:47.76 --> 00:49:54.44
It's interesting how you guys do that and he said yeah and he and I said you know, what do you say to these guys?

601
00:49:55.04 --> 00:49:57.78
When they're getting out of the army and there's a middle of a deployment and

602
00:49:59.16 --> 00:50:01.16
He looked at me and he said you know

603
00:50:02.16 --> 00:50:04.16
When I deal with a soldier

604
00:50:04.40 --> 00:50:09.54
Let's get out of the army. He said a lot of people will we'll say you can't leave us now

605
00:50:10.44 --> 00:50:15.16
You know you got to stick it out with us. You got to stay here. We need you

606
00:50:15.16 --> 00:50:21.16
And he said when I deal with a soldier that's getting out of the army

607
00:50:22.16 --> 00:50:28.68
I look at him and I shake their hands and I say thank you for your service and

608
00:50:33.32 --> 00:50:41.28
That to me was just awesome to to have a totally different attitude because the seal team is like that as well

609
00:50:41.28 --> 00:50:47.36
Someone's gonna get out of the seal teams. They're not gonna be on the middle of the deployment, but when you get back those. Oh, yeah, I'm getting out and everyone says all your equator

610
00:50:47.36 --> 00:50:51.56
above all, blah, blah, blah, and it's just a different attitude and what does that?

611
00:50:51.56 --> 00:50:54.32
What does it tell you about your community when you say hey?

612
00:50:54.32 --> 00:50:57.36
You know what I'm gonna get move on. I'm gonna take care of my family. I got to you know

613
00:50:57.84 --> 00:51:02.76
I got whatever going on in my life and I'm gonna get out of the seal teams and people are like oh your equator

614
00:51:03.08 --> 00:51:08.24
And that's normal. They do that in every branch. Not just the seal teams and here was this guy in his attitude was

615
00:51:08.24 --> 00:51:14.36
He's gonna say thank you for your service. He appreciate everything you've done and I wish you best luck

616
00:51:14.92 --> 00:51:20.24
That guy is more willing to change his mind because he's like wow I'm working for an incredible leader

617
00:51:20.24 --> 00:51:27.76
The army's awesome right and that that story always stuck with me. He about about how to treat people

618
00:51:28.96 --> 00:51:33.04
About how to treat people. This is a guy that put his life on the line for

619
00:51:33.04 --> 00:51:40.72
Months on end and only did we just say thank you for your service. Yeah, that's a leader right there

620
00:51:45.68 --> 00:51:47.68
Next one

621
00:51:47.92 --> 00:51:52.38
It is not by herangs at the moment of engaging

622
00:51:54.20 --> 00:51:56.20
Soldiers are rendered brave

623
00:51:56.20 --> 00:52:02.16
Veterans hardly listen to them and recruits forget them at the first discharge of a cannon

624
00:52:02.88 --> 00:52:05.88
If speeches and arguments aren't anytime useful

625
00:52:06.36 --> 00:52:10.56
It is during the course of the campaign by counteracting false reports and

626
00:52:11.32 --> 00:52:17.64
Causes of discontent maintaining proper spirit in the camp and furnishing subjects of

627
00:52:18.48 --> 00:52:20.48
Conversations in Bivilax

628
00:52:20.48 --> 00:52:29.68
These several objects be maybe attained by the printed orders of the day and so this is again as a leader in a leadership position

629
00:52:30.88 --> 00:52:32.88
this

630
00:52:33.52 --> 00:52:40.08
He's basically saying look at the moment of combat all year young and screaming and trying to motivate people is too late

631
00:52:40.08 --> 00:52:44.68
The veterans like the veterans aren't gonna listen to you and their crutes that once the cannon goes off

632
00:52:44.68 --> 00:52:47.80
They're not here and you either so your main focus needs to be

633
00:52:47.80 --> 00:52:56.80
You know during the the non-fire fight scenarios that's when you get people with the mindset that's gonna drive them through these bad situations

634
00:52:56.80 --> 00:53:02.76
If you're trying to do this trying to encourage people during the during the firefight you're late

635
00:53:09.96 --> 00:53:16.32
Theme of the night nothing is more important in war than unity in command

636
00:53:16.32 --> 00:53:28.20
When therefore you are carrying on hostilities against a single power only you should have but one army acting on one line and led by one commander

637
00:53:32.04 --> 00:53:34.04
Does that even need

638
00:53:35.04 --> 00:53:37.64
Explanation not really

639
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Unity of command

640
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:47.92
There are certain things in war of which the commander alone comprehends the importance

641
00:53:49.16 --> 00:53:55.04
Nothing but his superior firmness and ability can subdue and surround all difficulties

642
00:53:56.48 --> 00:54:01.76
This is the burden of command. This is recognizing when you're in a command position and when you're in a leadership position

643
00:54:01.76 --> 00:54:10.16
There are some things that are years alone and you have to drive from the top and I talk all the time about leadership being

644
00:54:11.48 --> 00:54:18.36
At every level and and how the lowest ranking guy is a leader and the person above him is leader all the way through the whole chain of command

645
00:54:18.64 --> 00:54:25.78
But this statement which I agree with as much as I know that leadership throughout the chain of command is

646
00:54:26.88 --> 00:54:28.24
infinitely

647
00:54:28.24 --> 00:54:29.92
important

648
00:54:29.92 --> 00:54:36.72
It is important as a leader to understand that there's some things that you and you alone are gonna understand and it's your responsibility

649
00:54:37.20 --> 00:54:43.30
to ensure that that peace of the battle is handled correctly

650
00:54:51.68 --> 00:54:55.08
This one's a little bit long. I'm gonna read it anyways

651
00:54:55.08 --> 00:55:03.60
To authorize generals and officers to lay down their arms by virtue of a special capitulation under any

652
00:55:03.84 --> 00:55:08.92
Other circumstances than when they constitute the garrison of a fortified place would

653
00:55:09.24 --> 00:55:15.24
Unquestionably be attended with dangerous consequences to open this door to cowards

654
00:55:15.24 --> 00:55:24.000
To men wanting an energy or even misguided brave men is to destroy the military spirit of a nation

655
00:55:26.28 --> 00:55:28.28
From Napoleon

656
00:55:28.28 --> 00:55:30.28
There can be no surrender

657
00:55:32.36 --> 00:55:36.68
An extraordinary situation requires extraordinary resolution

658
00:55:36.68 --> 00:55:46.12
Hmm note taken underlined in red and extraordinary situation requires extraordinary

659
00:55:46.68 --> 00:55:48.68
Resolution

660
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:58.08
How many things apparently impossible have never the less been performed by resolute men who had no alternative

661
00:55:58.68 --> 00:56:00.68
but death

662
00:56:02.04 --> 00:56:04.36
Strong words very strong words

663
00:56:04.36 --> 00:56:06.36
And

664
00:56:06.36 --> 00:56:14.88
We could go throughout military history and find case upon case where I would tell you yes absolutely that commander made a

665
00:56:15.40 --> 00:56:21.72
wise decision to surrender and you know that's there are situations where that happens

666
00:56:22.84 --> 00:56:28.24
But I think the main point of this is that to have that out there

667
00:56:28.24 --> 00:56:36.32
To have that as a thing right right is not smart is not smart and you know

668
00:56:36.76 --> 00:56:43.56
Going in with MMA fighters and telling them like listen if you get caught in a submission don't tap

669
00:56:43.96 --> 00:56:45.96
Let it break

670
00:56:45.96 --> 00:56:48.96
If you get put to choke go to sleep just

671
00:56:49.44 --> 00:56:51.84
There's no submission you are not tapping

672
00:56:51.84 --> 00:56:57.68
Now I've said that to guys and I've had some guys get out of some crazy

673
00:56:58.32 --> 00:57:05.04
Submissions that they should adapt and maybe they got a little bit injured, but they got out and I'm also had guys get caught in like some devastating

674
00:57:05.96 --> 00:57:08.84
Submissions and then like oh, you know what okay, I'm gonna tap because

675
00:57:10.32 --> 00:57:15.78
But the fact that that attitude wasn't out there right okay, and that like like okay

676
00:57:15.78 --> 00:57:19.64
You know what if you get caught you know what just tap I mean you're not gonna say to a fighter

677
00:57:19.64 --> 00:57:24.80
Okay, look if you caught in a bad arm lock, you know just tap no no you can't have a bad arm lock

678
00:57:25.60 --> 00:57:28.40
Get out of it yeah in competition let it break

679
00:57:28.40 --> 00:57:33.90
Like an MMA fight yeah, I mean obviously not yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Oh, yeah, I'm training. Sorry folks

680
00:57:34.18 --> 00:57:36.82
If you're in training tap early and tap the office

681
00:57:38.16 --> 00:57:45.08
Yeah, okay, so when you say having that be a thing that's out there meaning there's almost not I don't want to see it a shame

682
00:57:45.08 --> 00:57:52.46
But almost like etiquette is to not surrender. That's etiquette and it's so much an etiquette where it's here

683
00:57:52.76 --> 00:57:56.36
You don't surrender here. It's written planning which don't surrender right right

684
00:57:56.36 --> 00:57:58.18
It's not even etiquette. There's a better word for it

685
00:57:58.18 --> 00:58:03.44
There's a word I don't know what it is, but it's not etiquette. It's it's our

686
00:58:04.16 --> 00:58:08.92
ethos right that's what it is. It's our ethos is do not surrender right?

687
00:58:09.16 --> 00:58:12.68
So when someone does surrender when it's a good move

688
00:58:12.68 --> 00:58:15.60
How you say like everyone's in all there is it's like man

689
00:58:17.16 --> 00:58:22.24
There was literally no other option that could be conceived. Yeah, but to not have it out there

690
00:58:22.24 --> 00:58:25.72
You know that that commander took it to the end degree and

691
00:58:25.96 --> 00:58:32.34
Said you know what all of my man are gonna die for no reason now if I continue on with this so therefore

692
00:58:32.34 --> 00:58:37.88
We are going to surrender and hopefully we'll come back to fight another day. Yeah, otherwise. Yeah, it's

693
00:58:37.88 --> 00:58:43.44
If you know if I don't know someone even has this much mental weakness

694
00:58:43.88 --> 00:58:48.24
Going in he could get and that could kick in at a whole another time

695
00:58:48.24 --> 00:58:52.48
Yes, and now he's under this certain kind of mindset that man

696
00:58:52.48 --> 00:58:58.48
I could look for the easiest way out right here. Yeah, yeah, not real tired or man my shoulder got hurt on that last one

697
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.36
So maybe I'll just you know, but if he's in that mindset that

698
00:59:02.36 --> 00:59:08.000
Don't give up. You just can't surrender. He won't even consider that that won't even enter his mind

699
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.16
That's what I'm talking about that's exactly what I'm talking about

700
00:59:13.28 --> 00:59:20.16
Such conduct such conduct ought to be prescribed pronounced infamous and punishable with death

701
00:59:21.16 --> 00:59:27.84
The generals officers and soldiers who in battle have saved their lives by capitulating ought to be decimated

702
00:59:27.84 --> 00:59:36.08
He commands the arms to be surrendered and those who obey him are a like traders and deserve capital punishment

703
00:59:36.60 --> 00:59:38.76
So they say if you give up you just give up

704
00:59:39.48 --> 00:59:41.48
That's exactly what they're saying

705
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000
That's exactly what they're saying

706
00:59:47.52 --> 00:59:53.32
Now we're going to get in a little bit of something that we now refer to as extreme ownership

707
00:59:53.32 --> 00:59:55.32
a

708
00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:05.04
General in chief cannot exonerate himself from responsibility for for his faults by pleading and order of his sovereign or the minister

709
01:00:05.68 --> 01:00:11.24
When the individual from whom it proceeds is at a distance from the field of operations and

710
01:00:11.56 --> 01:00:15.96
But partially or not at all acquainted with the actual conditions of things

711
01:00:17.48 --> 01:00:21.80
So you if I tell you to do something and it doesn't go well for you

712
01:00:21.80 --> 01:00:27.44
It you're out in the field and I told you hey charge this machine gun nest and you do it and everyone dies

713
01:00:27.44 --> 01:00:30.56
And you come back and say hey it wasn't my fault of a joc was fault

714
01:00:31.36 --> 01:00:36.60
The point is here no doesn't work that way does not work that way

715
01:00:41.08 --> 01:00:43.08
hence

716
01:00:44.20 --> 01:00:49.68
It follows that every general and treat chief who undertakes to execute a plan

717
01:00:49.68 --> 01:00:52.40
Which he knows to be bad is culpable

718
01:00:53.32 --> 01:00:59.000
So if I tell you to go attack that machine gun nest and you know it's a bad plan and you executed anyways your fault

719
01:01:00.52 --> 01:01:02.84
That's kind of like I mean that whole idea is

720
01:01:05.48 --> 01:01:13.16
You take responsibility for your direct actions, right? So it's kind of like if you do the opposite of that it's like okay

721
01:01:13.16 --> 01:01:19.000
I you know I was speeding I got caught right I got speeding I got to take it is that my fault

722
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.32
Because yes, it's my fault, but in a way if I don't want to exercise this concept in a way

723
01:01:24.32 --> 01:01:26.32
It's my parents fault for having me

724
01:01:26.88 --> 01:01:33.36
Or maybe not teaching me the value of following traffic. I'm not gone to have this discussion with you

725
01:01:33.56 --> 01:01:40.96
That's just completely ridiculous. It's the same thing. You can blame your parents for your speeding echo Charles

726
01:01:40.96 --> 01:01:46.36
That's what I'm saying. I'll let you do that. That's the point. That's the point of making it that's the end of point here is that

727
01:01:46.36 --> 01:01:52.12
If you're doing something this is even more of an extreme point. This is if your parents tell you to speed

728
01:01:52.44 --> 01:01:57.36
And you go out and get caught speeding and pulled over you go hey my parents somebody's right even more direct

729
01:01:57.36 --> 01:01:59.64
Yeah, that's what I'm saying is you knew it was wrong

730
01:01:59.64 --> 01:02:04.16
You knew you shouldn't be doing it and what Napoleon is saying is it's your fault you're culpable

731
01:02:05.52 --> 01:02:07.52
period

732
01:02:07.52 --> 01:02:08.52
period

733
01:02:08.52 --> 01:02:10.52
with you let's say

734
01:02:11.56 --> 01:02:13.36
period you knew it was wrong

735
01:02:13.36 --> 01:02:19.92
So it would a better plan of action be expressed that you know that the mission or whatever is wrong

736
01:02:19.92 --> 01:02:22.60
Yeah, you should be like hey, I'm not doing this. Oh, and fact he goes on

737
01:02:22.76 --> 01:02:28.76
He should communicate his reasons insist on a change of plan and finally resign his commission

738
01:02:29.44 --> 01:02:32.72
Rather than become the instrument of the of his army's ruin

739
01:02:33.16 --> 01:02:37.56
This is just the this is the most probably the most powerful thing we're gonna talk about tonight

740
01:02:37.56 --> 01:02:45.04
I'm gonna read it again a general and chief cannot exonerate himself from responsibility for his faults by pleading an order of his sovereign of the minister

741
01:02:45.40 --> 01:02:50.08
When the individual from whom it proceeds is at a distance from the field of operations and

742
01:02:50.64 --> 01:02:54.40
But partially or not at all acquainted with the actual condition of things

743
01:02:54.68 --> 01:02:57.96
So this is an order that's coming on from high from somebody that doesn't know

744
01:02:58.72 --> 01:03:00.72
hence it follows

745
01:03:00.72 --> 01:03:09.80
That every general and chief who undertakes to execute a plan which he knows to be bad is culpable

746
01:03:09.80 --> 01:03:15.48
He should communicate his reasons insist on a change of plan and finally

747
01:03:16.64 --> 01:03:23.52
resign his commission so quit his job rather than become an instrument of his army's ruin

748
01:03:23.52 --> 01:03:34.68
Every general and chief who in consequence of orders from his superiors gives battle with the certainty of defeat is equally culpable

749
01:03:36.48 --> 01:03:38.48
This is ownership

750
01:03:38.48 --> 01:03:42.000
This is hey, I got told to do something. I don't agree with it. Hey boss

751
01:03:42.24 --> 01:03:48.24
You got to listen to me here. This is not the way we need to execute this here's a better plan here's another plan here's a here's an alternative

752
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
because if you

753
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.44
Give battle with the certainty of defeat your culpable

754
01:03:55.04 --> 01:03:59.64
regardless of who told you to do what individual responsibility and this is

755
01:04:00.36 --> 01:04:05.28
especially important to have this concept coming from somebody that was as

756
01:04:06.72 --> 01:04:08.72
Egotistical and

757
01:04:08.92 --> 01:04:13.64
Expected so much discipline from his troops that to have Napoleon himself

758
01:04:13.64 --> 01:04:20.44
Saying this like if it's a bad order you shouldn't do it. This is Napoleon saying this, right?

759
01:04:20.80 --> 01:04:24.04
So that's how important it is to have this

760
01:04:24.92 --> 01:04:32.36
This culture in your organization to make sure that everybody knows regardless of what you get told you've got to do the right thing

761
01:04:32.36 --> 01:04:39.36
And it's everyone's individual responsibility to take extreme ownership of everything that's happening and

762
01:04:39.36 --> 01:04:43.16
And not just like you know what I'm gonna point my point my finger up the chain of command

763
01:04:43.64 --> 01:04:48.000
Blame them when something goes wrong. I've talked about this before you know

764
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.96
Many times I blame my bosses for things that went wrong zero

765
01:04:51.60 --> 01:04:55.60
Never blame my bosses. How could it ever be their fault? I was in charge

766
01:04:55.60 --> 01:05:11.44
And if they told me to do something that was stupid I would tell them look. I'm not doing that. Here's why. Let's find a better way

767
01:05:13.92 --> 01:05:19.12
The first qualification of a general and chief is to possess a cool head

768
01:05:19.12 --> 01:05:25.80
So that things may appear to him in their true proportions and as they really are

769
01:05:30.40 --> 01:05:34.40
It's beautiful. It's a beautiful statement possess a cool head

770
01:05:34.40 --> 01:05:41.08
So that things may appear to him in their true proportions and as they really are

771
01:05:41.08 --> 01:05:47.44
He should not suffer himself to be unduly affected by good or bad news the

772
01:05:49.84 --> 01:05:52.08
Impressions which are made upon his mind

773
01:05:52.36 --> 01:06:00.04
Successively or simultaneously in the course of a day should be so classified in his memory that each shall occupy its proper place

774
01:06:01.24 --> 01:06:09.64
For sound reasoning and judgment result from first examining each of these varied impressions by itself and then comparing them

775
01:06:09.64 --> 01:06:11.64
All with one another

776
01:06:12.68 --> 01:06:14.68
So you're gonna hear all these things

777
01:06:15.64 --> 01:06:19.24
All these different impressions you're gonna get rumors

778
01:06:20.56 --> 01:06:22.56
gossip

779
01:06:22.56 --> 01:06:29.08
Reports probably heard this the first report in war is always wrong. You can hear all that stuff and you got to you got to detach from it

780
01:06:29.08 --> 01:06:35.12
You can't get emotional you got to categorize them and then once you hear them all you can look at them and

781
01:06:35.68 --> 01:06:37.68
assess them all in their own light

782
01:06:37.68 --> 01:06:41.48
There are reason there there are some men who

783
01:06:41.96 --> 01:06:48.36
From their physical and moral constitution deck everything in the colors of imagination

784
01:06:49.04 --> 01:06:55.32
With whatever knowledge talents courage or other good qualities these may be endowed

785
01:06:55.92 --> 01:07:01.64
Nature has not fitted them for the command of armies and the direction of the great

786
01:07:01.64 --> 01:07:10.68
Operations of war so anybody that gets emotional that that here's something and let's it cloud their decisions that gets too close to problems

787
01:07:10.68 --> 01:07:17.52
They're not cut out to lead in war and I have one hundred percent agree with that and they're not cut out to lead in any situation

788
01:07:17.52 --> 01:07:23.52
Hmm

789
01:07:27.20 --> 01:07:34.32
To be familiar with the geography and topography of the country to be skillful in making reconnaissance to be

790
01:07:34.32 --> 01:07:37.52
Attentive to the dispatch of orders

791
01:07:38.48 --> 01:07:44.76
To be capable of exhibiting with simplicity the most complicated movements of an army

792
01:07:44.76 --> 01:07:51.88
These are qualifications that should distinguish the officer called to the station of chief of staff

793
01:07:52.44 --> 01:08:00.40
And my favorite of those is to be capable of exhibiting with simplicity the most complicated movements of the army

794
01:08:00.40 --> 01:08:05.84
I talk about all this all the time. It's a one of our laws of combat

795
01:08:06.08 --> 01:08:10.04
It's a chapter and extreme ownership that we wrote about in simplicity and

796
01:08:10.04 --> 01:08:16.36
A lot of times we talk about giving clear concise orders simple clear concise orders

797
01:08:17.24 --> 01:08:19.24
So that's that's another mark of

798
01:08:19.88 --> 01:08:23.68
Someone that can lead well is someone that can take complex ideas

799
01:08:24.68 --> 01:08:26.68
simplify them and

800
01:08:26.68 --> 01:08:28.68
Communicate them in a simple manner

801
01:08:29.48 --> 01:08:36.04
Is that like you know how in jujitsu you'll you'll like people name moves? Yes, I'll do like some give moves name

802
01:08:36.04 --> 01:08:42.64
But each move will have like you know four five six ten parts to that move details that are important to make them move

803
01:08:42.64 --> 01:08:44.40
You name it one move you learn that home move

804
01:08:45.52 --> 01:08:48.52
So it takes these complex

805
01:08:50.04 --> 01:08:53.56
Orders or moves and simplifies it. Yes, especially when you're communicating

806
01:08:53.56 --> 01:08:55.56
You know do this

807
01:08:55.56 --> 01:09:03.04
And there there are I mean there definitely are coaches that can take complex moves and break them down very simply and

808
01:09:03.04 --> 01:09:05.04
And

809
01:09:05.44 --> 01:09:11.28
That is that is what makes are good instructor right that is what makes a good instructor someone that can explain to you exactly

810
01:09:11.92 --> 01:09:18.000
What you do with your weight exactly where you put your forearm exactly and then and then

811
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.08
Explain to you that you know what this might be a little bit different from you for you because you're a different human

812
01:09:22.48 --> 01:09:26.80
But here's exactly what I do and here's the effect that I'm looking for when I do it

813
01:09:27.84 --> 01:09:29.20
Very simple

814
01:09:29.20 --> 01:09:31.20
That's what we're looking for

815
01:09:31.20 --> 01:09:35.36
The first principle of a general and chief is to calculate what he must do

816
01:09:36.32 --> 01:09:45.80
To see if he has all the means to surround the obstacles with which the enemy can oppose him and when he has made his decision to do everything to overcome them

817
01:09:46.48 --> 01:09:48.48
Again, that's to me is about

818
01:09:48.48 --> 01:09:50.48
commitment

819
01:09:50.48 --> 01:09:52.16
next

820
01:09:52.16 --> 01:09:54.88
War is composed of nothing but accidents

821
01:09:54.88 --> 01:10:00.16
and

822
01:10:00.16 --> 01:10:03.92
Although holding to general principles a general should never lose sight of everything to enable him to profit from these accidents

823
01:10:04.32 --> 01:10:06.32
That is the mark of a genius

824
01:10:07.28 --> 01:10:08.48
in war

825
01:10:08.48 --> 01:10:13.20
There is but one favorable moment the great art is to seize it

826
01:10:14.96 --> 01:10:16.48
Business

827
01:10:16.48 --> 01:10:17.76
Obviously

828
01:10:17.76 --> 01:10:23.20
Gjitsu obviously fighting obviously these that's just there's there's moments

829
01:10:23.20 --> 01:10:25.20
There's opportunity

830
01:10:26.56 --> 01:10:28.56
There's opportunity

831
01:10:29.20 --> 01:10:35.04
and when you when you have that opportunity the art is to seize it

832
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.20
Very simply

833
01:10:37.20 --> 01:10:43.44
Defensive war does not exclude attacking just as offensive war does not exclude defending

834
01:10:43.44 --> 01:10:52.88
Although its aim may be to force the frontier and invade the enemy's country

835
01:10:53.28 --> 01:11:00.08
I just think it's important to not only think about hey you should be attacking and defending at the same time and

836
01:11:00.08 --> 01:11:04.72
Defending and attacking at the same time but also we gotta remember the the

837
01:11:04.72 --> 01:11:11.92
contradiction in the fact that he's a guy that talks about offense offense offense but even he has to balance that with defense

838
01:11:13.60 --> 01:11:19.44
Even Napoleon has to balance things and we'll do the last one

839
01:11:26.24 --> 01:11:32.64
A doubtful general who acts without principles and without plan even though he lead

840
01:11:32.64 --> 01:11:42.24
Even though he lead an army numerically superior to that of the enemy almost always finds himself inferior to the latter on the field of battle

841
01:11:43.60 --> 01:11:45.60
Fumblings

842
01:11:45.84 --> 01:11:47.84
The middle course

843
01:11:48.48 --> 01:11:50.48
Lose all in war

844
01:11:53.36 --> 01:11:56.32
And I just like the fact that he's talking about

845
01:11:56.32 --> 01:12:02.72
Principled leadership and I would say that principle leadership

846
01:12:03.44 --> 01:12:17.20
Not just in a leadership position, but as a person what are your principles as a person and if you have principles as a human and you stand by those principles

847
01:12:18.88 --> 01:12:20.88
You're gonna be successful

848
01:12:20.88 --> 01:12:25.52
You're gonna win whereas if you take the middle course and you

849
01:12:26.48 --> 01:12:30.96
Wave or you don't just don't have principles on which to stand

850
01:12:32.08 --> 01:12:34.08
Then you fall apart and

851
01:12:36.56 --> 01:12:43.36
I think that everybody should look to define what their principles are yeah actually define them

852
01:12:44.24 --> 01:12:47.28
I can tell you that I would love to tell you that when I was

853
01:12:47.28 --> 01:12:51.04
You know 19 years old I sat down and wrote down

854
01:12:51.68 --> 01:12:55.84
Jocquos principles of life. I didn't do that. I wish I would have

855
01:12:56.96 --> 01:13:00.88
And I can tell you that as I grew up in the Seal teams there I

856
01:13:01.52 --> 01:13:06.000
Probably added principles and I had some bad ones and I had some good ones

857
01:13:07.52 --> 01:13:09.52
And I think that

858
01:13:09.52 --> 01:13:16.16
Those those principles though when you get to a point where you know that your principles are solid and honestly to me

859
01:13:16.16 --> 01:13:23.36
The best or the the the the biggest thing I've done to define the principles

860
01:13:24.72 --> 01:13:31.04
That I live by is really the book that life and I wrote extreme ownership that's the that was the culmination of

861
01:13:31.36 --> 01:13:33.36
20 years in the Seal teams and

862
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.80
Putting together the principles that that that I live by and

863
01:13:38.80 --> 01:13:46.80
The survival by so I think it's just very important to think about what your principles are as a person

864
01:13:47.36 --> 01:13:53.28
What you're trying to achieve and have those principles like a guiding strategy underneath everything that you're doing

865
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
And that's one thing that's good about these podcasts

866
01:13:57.28 --> 01:13:59.28
is that

867
01:13:59.28 --> 01:14:06.40
You know, I'm I've been lucky enough to capture some of these you know like the letters that we read last time these counseling letters

868
01:14:06.40 --> 01:14:11.60
I'm talking about my personal principles in those those were my principles on how to lead

869
01:14:13.12 --> 01:14:16.000
And so I think it's important to

870
01:14:16.88 --> 01:14:21.20
Come up with those principles and define them and let those principles reflect

871
01:14:21.92 --> 01:14:24.56
You know who you are as a person and what you want to be

872
01:14:25.84 --> 01:14:28.88
And I wish that I would have been told to do that

873
01:14:29.84 --> 01:14:31.84
When I was 13 years old

874
01:14:33.20 --> 01:14:35.20
Because I think it is that important

875
01:14:35.20 --> 01:14:37.20
And as a person

876
01:14:38.40 --> 01:14:39.36
Yeah, and it

877
01:14:40.40 --> 01:14:42.16
It seems like anyway that

878
01:14:43.44 --> 01:14:46.40
Defining your principles it seems like that's a

879
01:14:47.36 --> 01:14:50.08
That's kind of an ongoing process yes because

880
01:14:50.96 --> 01:14:56.64
It's one of the things where you think you have your principles, you know, but I don't know for example

881
01:14:57.36 --> 01:15:02.24
You could have just heard it on some speech that really resonated with you so you're dang you think you have

882
01:15:02.24 --> 01:15:09.76
Printing these specific principles now, but you haven't really defined them you just kind of liked how that sounded and you maybe thought of one two three

883
01:15:10.16 --> 01:15:15.68
situations where they're not applies to me and let me tell you what you're talking about right now your number one principle

884
01:15:16.40 --> 01:15:17.44
should be

885
01:15:17.44 --> 01:15:18.80
for your mind

886
01:15:18.80 --> 01:15:20.80
and and have humility

887
01:15:20.80 --> 01:15:29.36
to never say the principles that I'm standing upon are never going to change because I know everything right now and we've talked about this before yes. I know

888
01:15:29.36 --> 01:15:31.36
I

889
01:15:31.36 --> 01:15:33.36
If I look at myself

890
01:15:33.36 --> 01:15:39.68
10 years ago, I know nothing compared to what I know now. Yeah, if I look to myself 20 years ago, I know even less I'm just a lost

891
01:15:40.80 --> 01:15:42.80
Animal out in the woods

892
01:15:43.60 --> 01:15:47.52
So you have to you know build these principles and like you said

893
01:15:48.56 --> 01:15:50.32
And I think there's a difference between

894
01:15:50.96 --> 01:15:58.72
Being a flip flop or like you know your hip politicians get you know, oh your flip flop or because you said you don't support kind of troll and now you and now you

895
01:15:58.72 --> 01:16:02.000
You do you do support it now you don't support or whatever or you do support

896
01:16:02.88 --> 01:16:07.76
Bring it in refugees or not so and people get to call the flip flop or and and I actually

897
01:16:08.88 --> 01:16:16.08
I think there's some core principles that shouldn't change even for a politician and even for a person but there's a lot of peripheral

898
01:16:17.36 --> 01:16:24.08
You know, I think there's peripheral principles that do evolve and do change and you do end up with different priorities in your life and I think that's

899
01:16:24.08 --> 01:16:28.08
Okay, you know there was a large portion of my life

900
01:16:29.92 --> 01:16:36.48
Where the seal teams was absolutely the most important thing and nothing else was even a close second

901
01:16:37.04 --> 01:16:42.08
Including things like my personal health including things like my own family

902
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.72
Including things like my future the everything was just completely

903
01:16:49.72 --> 01:16:59.96
Unimportant compared to the seal teams and while that makes for a fired-up seal and I wouldn't trade that

904
01:16:59.96 --> 01:17:04.52
I wouldn't even want to change that principle. I mean that that's what I needed at the time to do a good job

905
01:17:05.24 --> 01:17:08.52
But you know at a some point I had to say okay, I

906
01:17:09.88 --> 01:17:14.20
I need to think about something else. You know there I need to evolve as a human and

907
01:17:14.20 --> 01:17:22.52
Yeah, and and you know little things like I need to take care of my family. You know, I need to actually pay attention to them and not just pay attention to my

908
01:17:22.52 --> 01:17:27.96
Seal-patoon or my seal task unit or the guys don't work with so you so I think it's okay to

909
01:17:28.76 --> 01:17:29.96
evolve your principles

910
01:17:30.12 --> 01:17:32.12
But I think more important

911
01:17:32.84 --> 01:17:36.76
Is that you need to define your principles and where you are and that also is a way

912
01:17:37.56 --> 01:17:39.08
to

913
01:17:39.08 --> 01:17:42.12
Check your growth and see what course you're on

914
01:17:42.12 --> 01:17:44.36
Yeah, you know, this is one thing that I talk about

915
01:17:45.48 --> 01:17:47.56
When I was in the seal teams, I used to talk about this

916
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.04
The most important piece of information on the battlefield

917
01:17:53.40 --> 01:17:56.68
What do you think the most important piece of information on the battlefield to Zekko?

918
01:17:59.40 --> 01:18:05.80
Echo has no idea. I can come up with an idea, but it'll take a little bit. Yeah, so I used to ask that question to

919
01:18:05.96 --> 01:18:10.76
Everybody to senior guys junior guys and they'd all kinds of you know where you know where the bad guys are

920
01:18:10.76 --> 01:18:15.64
What you know where the target is. I mean that everyone would have different answers

921
01:18:16.36 --> 01:18:23.96
And there's actually only one answer the most important piece of information that you can have on the battlefield is where you are

922
01:18:24.44 --> 01:18:27.24
It's to know where you are on the battlefield

923
01:18:27.64 --> 01:18:29.64
Do you know where you're at?

924
01:18:29.64 --> 01:18:31.64
If you don't know where you're at

925
01:18:31.64 --> 01:18:35.08
Does it really matter if you know where the enemy is? No because you don't even know where you are

926
01:18:35.88 --> 01:18:37.56
If you if you don't know where you're at

927
01:18:37.56 --> 01:18:41.88
Can you even navigate correctly? No because you don't even know where you are

928
01:18:42.60 --> 01:18:45.000
If you don't know where you're at can you get closer?

929
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Support can you call for

930
01:18:47.40 --> 01:18:50.92
Aircraft to come in and drop bombs? No you don't even know where you are

931
01:18:51.96 --> 01:18:55.08
So that piece of data when will you when you apply that to life

932
01:18:56.76 --> 01:19:01.16
How do you know where you are if you're not tracking what your principles are?

933
01:19:01.16 --> 01:19:07.80
Right dancers you're not you're not gonna if you're not gonna know where you are and you're not gonna see how you evolve and when I work with businesses

934
01:19:07.80 --> 01:19:09.16
I use the same principles

935
01:19:09.32 --> 01:19:12.76
Businesses will go out and operate off of instinct

936
01:19:13.64 --> 01:19:18.44
Now you have to trust your instinct and you have to understand it, but you all have to track what the facts are

937
01:19:18.92 --> 01:19:22.20
You know I'd say like where you're metrics how do you know what you did

938
01:19:23.40 --> 01:19:25.40
Last year this time in

939
01:19:25.40 --> 01:19:27.88
Profitability how do you know what you did in sales

940
01:19:27.88 --> 01:19:35.24
You how do you know what you did in product development if you're not tracking it you don't know where you are on the battlefield

941
01:19:35.24 --> 01:19:41.08
And if you don't know where you are on the battlefield you're lost so the your principles

942
01:19:42.36 --> 01:19:47.88
Kind of just continue to be more and more informed you know like you thought about when you're 13 or 16 however old

943
01:19:48.04 --> 01:19:51.32
Where you think you have these principles because I don't know you listen to Henry or Allen

944
01:19:52.60 --> 01:19:54.60
But as you

945
01:19:54.60 --> 01:20:02.36
Conduct yourself through life within open mind and all these you you're offered all these different perspectives that start to solidify your principles

946
01:20:02.76 --> 01:20:04.76
so

947
01:20:04.76 --> 01:20:12.28
Talk about the difference between a flip flopper and then and someone who's who simply open minded right and evolves yeah the differences that

948
01:20:13.80 --> 01:20:19.000
Someone who continuously evolves will have an open mind at the same time have pretty concrete principles

949
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.24
Yes, so when they're offered something significant

950
01:20:21.24 --> 01:20:28.60
That is simply a difference in perspective that is gonna that's gonna essentially on an in a fundamental way

951
01:20:28.60 --> 01:20:33.40
Align with their principles if their principles are fairness and you know these these things that are in our

952
01:20:33.40 --> 01:20:35.80
Eugually good as far as being part of your principles

953
01:20:36.84 --> 01:20:38.84
They're gonna evolve when these

954
01:20:40.44 --> 01:20:42.84
Separate perspectives get presented to them and

955
01:20:42.84 --> 01:20:52.60
And thus solidifying their principles even more yes and echo just use the word thus and I like that

956
01:20:53.16 --> 01:20:57.24
I like that no, true, and I think that's uh like this is good

957
01:20:58.20 --> 01:21:04.20
Good thing to keep in mind as you know people move forward is what are your principles

958
01:21:05.64 --> 01:21:10.36
How are they evolving how are they improving have they gotten better?

959
01:21:10.36 --> 01:21:17.88
Right those are great questions for every individual asked those are questions I'm asking myself right now on the jocco podcast live

960
01:21:18.12 --> 01:21:20.12
It's happening

961
01:21:20.92 --> 01:21:22.92
So speaking of which

962
01:21:22.92 --> 01:21:29.08
We got some questions speaking of questions speaking questions the first question in episode five you mentioned

963
01:21:29.64 --> 01:21:31.64
Treating people with a blank slate

964
01:21:34.12 --> 01:21:36.60
How do you deal with Miss judging a person?

965
01:21:36.60 --> 01:21:46.20
In the event of you Miss judging yeah, so that was you know in reference to a person that that we went through a counseling sheet on and

966
01:21:46.84 --> 01:21:48.84
the

967
01:21:49.64 --> 01:21:53.96
Fact was that I'd heard some bad stuff about them, you know bad hit a bad reputation

968
01:21:55.40 --> 01:22:00.36
etc and so I was saying that hey, you know, I I treat everyone like a blank slate

969
01:22:01.56 --> 01:22:03.56
and

970
01:22:03.56 --> 01:22:08.44
So first of all I talked about this before is I set low expectations for people

971
01:22:08.84 --> 01:22:10.84
I don't have a super high

972
01:22:11.08 --> 01:22:13.08
Expectations of

973
01:22:13.72 --> 01:22:19.24
What they're gonna do and how well they're gonna deliver and actually somebody hit me on Twitter today and said something along the lines of

974
01:22:19.96 --> 01:22:23.000
I like the fact that everyone with you starts at zero

975
01:22:23.80 --> 01:22:31.24
And I'm and he said I'm the same way he's saying he was the same way and I think that's a it's a pretty good attitude to have like everyone starts at zero

976
01:22:31.24 --> 01:22:33.96
Right and that's a better way to put it in my opinion

977
01:22:34.60 --> 01:22:39.48
Yeah, okay, okay, you have a zero and and again, I don't mean to sound like a negative person, but

978
01:22:40.36 --> 01:22:45.40
I just don't set high expectations. I set it. I'm a zero right and look you show me who you are

979
01:22:45.40 --> 01:22:46.68
I'm not gonna

980
01:22:46.68 --> 01:22:48.68
predict one way or the other

981
01:22:48.68 --> 01:22:51.08
I understand that people do crazy things

982
01:22:52.04 --> 01:22:55.64
and and people are crazy in many ways

983
01:22:55.64 --> 01:23:01.48
They're ego their personality their issues mean people

984
01:23:02.44 --> 01:23:04.44
Their emotions

985
01:23:04.44 --> 01:23:08.44
People do crazy things so I don't that's another thing that keeps me from

986
01:23:09.16 --> 01:23:11.56
Giving people all kinds of credit out of the gate

987
01:23:12.92 --> 01:23:14.44
And and I do

988
01:23:14.44 --> 01:23:16.44
way what other people say

989
01:23:16.84 --> 01:23:19.72
You know, I take it into account, but I definitely

990
01:23:19.72 --> 01:23:25.40
Am careful to use my own judgment and not cloud my vision with what somebody else said about so and so

991
01:23:25.96 --> 01:23:27.24
So

992
01:23:27.24 --> 01:23:32.52
You know, how do I deal with misjudging a person? It's kind of what we were just talking about. I don't

993
01:23:33.16 --> 01:23:35.64
Set permanent judgment on someone and

994
01:23:36.44 --> 01:23:41.56
Say echoes bat and I don't like him and I don't trust him

995
01:23:42.36 --> 01:23:49.08
That's not a permanent thing. You know, I I'm gonna build from zero and I'm gonna say oh, you know what actually hey

996
01:23:49.08 --> 01:23:53.32
He did a good job with that or hey he had my back on that so I'm not

997
01:23:53.88 --> 01:23:56.04
Stuck in my ways and I don't

998
01:23:56.76 --> 01:24:01.72
I don't hold grudges against people and say this person's never gonna change that being said

999
01:24:02.76 --> 01:24:08.84
Man, it's hard to change the spots of the leopard, you know people are who they are and it's a very difficult

1000
01:24:08.84 --> 01:24:12.60
Yes, sir some people can grow and change and evolve and that's great

1001
01:24:12.92 --> 01:24:16.92
But a lot of people they are who they are and so you have to take that into account as well

1002
01:24:16.92 --> 01:24:24.12
Right, yeah when you say like trusting someone once let's say someone burns you and whatever way and then you know a week later

1003
01:24:24.12 --> 01:24:25.32
Whatever

1004
01:24:25.32 --> 01:24:29.88
They had your back in a way that was really unexpected compared to you know that action that they did

1005
01:24:29.88 --> 01:24:34.12
So basically what that does is help paint and overall picture of what kind of person this is to you

1006
01:24:34.12 --> 01:24:37.40
So where it's like okay, maybe I can trust him in this type of situation

1007
01:24:37.40 --> 01:24:39.48
Yeah, when they use benefits and in in

1008
01:24:39.64 --> 01:24:46.04
Detriments or in play and these other situations I can't so it's kind of this and then as you have more and more experience with people

1009
01:24:46.04 --> 01:24:51.08
They paint more of a picture. Yeah, so trust even saying trust that's such a broad brush

1010
01:24:51.40 --> 01:24:58.04
You know certain incentives are involved involved you can't trust a certain person to do or not do certain things

1011
01:24:58.04 --> 01:25:01.32
But yeah offer up different incentives and you know you can trust them

1012
01:25:01.56 --> 01:25:06.04
Yeah, and so I think the same thing that you're just saying is what I'm saying is I don't I'm not gonna miss

1013
01:25:06.04 --> 01:25:09.56
Judge someone because my judgment is not a permanent all

1014
01:25:09.56 --> 01:25:18.68
All powerful statement of one time. Yeah, I'm constantly looking at people and like you said learning impressions of their whole

1015
01:25:19.88 --> 01:25:22.60
Their whole entity. Yeah, what they're all about

1016
01:25:24.44 --> 01:25:26.44
Next

1017
01:25:26.44 --> 01:25:29.08
So starting out in jujitsu

1018
01:25:30.12 --> 01:25:32.52
How do you find a good gym in your area?

1019
01:25:32.52 --> 01:25:40.76
Yeah, okay, so this is actually a question, you know, we plucked one out of many of people that have hit us up on

1020
01:25:42.68 --> 01:25:44.68
Twitter about where to find a good

1021
01:25:45.56 --> 01:25:49.08
Presilling jujitsu gym because people I think people have heard

1022
01:25:50.04 --> 01:25:53.80
us talking about jujitsu and they heard me talking about it with Joe Rogan

1023
01:25:54.92 --> 01:25:59.16
You know, her retoken about with Tim Ferriss. I mean something that I talk about something that is definitely a big part of my life

1024
01:25:59.16 --> 01:26:04.92
I know it's a big part of your life as well and so people think you know I'd like to check that out and I think that's awesome

1025
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.88
And if you're out there and you're gonna ask me if you should start jujitsu

1026
01:26:10.52 --> 01:26:15.32
And you're gonna give me a whole bunch of quantifiers that you're old or you work a lot or you

1027
01:26:16.12 --> 01:26:20.68
You've been sick or you've been injured or whatever you're gonna tell me and I can tell you 99.99

1028
01:26:21.40 --> 01:26:27.48
99.9% of the time my answer is gonna be yes you should start jujitsu except if your sickness is contagious

1029
01:26:27.48 --> 01:26:33.24
Except if your sickness is contagious or if you're a bully or you're a sadist

1030
01:26:33.80 --> 01:26:37.000
You're an evil person that's hungry for a power. I'm gonna tell you don't

1031
01:26:38.28 --> 01:26:43.000
Start jujitsu because you're gonna use it for bad things

1032
01:26:43.48 --> 01:26:46.84
Yeah, and even before that I think you might get it

1033
01:26:47.88 --> 01:26:49.08
Turned on you

1034
01:26:49.08 --> 01:26:52.84
You know how like because it's really easy to depends on the school, but

1035
01:26:52.84 --> 01:26:59.16
For the most part it's really easy to spot a bully when it comes to the gym and it's you and it doesn't fare well

1036
01:26:59.16 --> 01:27:05.96
It doesn't fare well. It'll maybe fare well for a day or even maybe one five-minute match or something like that

1037
01:27:05.96 --> 01:27:09.40
That meant it doesn't yeah jujitsu is a self-regulating

1038
01:27:09.96 --> 01:27:13.88
Yeah, for the most part. Yes self-regulating seeing very few people

1039
01:27:14.44 --> 01:27:21.64
Can maintain and and most people with bully bullying attitudes don't have the humility to continue in jujitsu for a long time

1040
01:27:21.64 --> 01:27:27.40
Anyways, yes, so that's another way that itself pleases so how do you find a good

1041
01:27:28.28 --> 01:27:30.28
jujitsu gym

1042
01:27:30.28 --> 01:27:34.84
Obviously you start with Google you find out some locations to me proximity is very important

1043
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.48
So you want a place that's you know on your way to work on your way home from more close to your house

1044
01:27:39.48 --> 01:27:43.16
So it's somewhere that you're gonna get in there and train because you don't want to sign up for a gym

1045
01:27:44.04 --> 01:27:48.76
And never go because it's too far too out of the way so proximity is definitely a factor

1046
01:27:48.76 --> 01:27:58.04
Then you're gonna ask yourself what are you looking for because jujitsu gyms very tremendously in how they're set up how they're run and

1047
01:27:58.84 --> 01:28:02.20
All those things. I mean there's really super traditional

1048
01:28:03.56 --> 01:28:10.28
Brazilian jujitsu gyms where they you you bow before you get on the mat you bow after you you bow to the instructor

1049
01:28:10.44 --> 01:28:14.60
When you're gonna talk to him you are very they're very strict with uniforms

1050
01:28:14.60 --> 01:28:21.64
That you know only a white uniform you have to have this certain patch on your uniform to represent the school that's that's one type of

1051
01:28:25.08 --> 01:28:29.000
Appness fear that you could have then you could have a very loose atmosphere where it's like you know

1052
01:28:29.32 --> 01:28:33.88
You're gonna come in you're gonna train there is no bowing there's there's handshakes and there's respect

1053
01:28:34.76 --> 01:28:37.08
But it's not as overt and not as

1054
01:28:38.12 --> 01:28:43.40
Imposed as it would be in a more traditional Brazilian jujitsu school. So what are you looking for you know for me?

1055
01:28:43.40 --> 01:28:49.96
I always you know and and if you come to my gym it's a very it's a very relaxed atmosphere in terms of

1056
01:28:50.68 --> 01:28:52.68
Traditionally imposed discipline

1057
01:28:53.64 --> 01:28:56.92
But when you roll there will be discipline imposed

1058
01:28:58.44 --> 01:29:03.72
It's pretty dynamic though like we have such a big group of people that

1059
01:29:04.84 --> 01:29:10.52
To go in there and and to get a non-competitive roll is you can easily do that

1060
01:29:10.52 --> 01:29:15.16
Yeah, that's sure in fact you you it's easy to choose it's easy to be like okay

1061
01:29:15.16 --> 01:29:21.000
I know let's roll with this group and it's gonna it's gonna I'm gonna go over here with this crew today and they're gonna bring it or

1062
01:29:21.24 --> 01:29:25.56
You know what I'm gonna chill with these guys over here and we're gonna work on some technique and maybe I can ask this guy about that

1063
01:29:25.56 --> 01:29:28.20
Yeah, so that's that's good that is good

1064
01:29:29.16 --> 01:29:34.20
You know there's also a are you gonna go to a school that's very focused on sport jujitsu

1065
01:29:34.76 --> 01:29:37.48
which is hey we're gonna compete we're gonna learn

1066
01:29:37.48 --> 01:29:41.40
The techniques that are very applicable to

1067
01:29:42.28 --> 01:29:44.68
to competing in jujitsu yeah

1068
01:29:45.96 --> 01:29:52.44
Or am I gonna do something that's more towards self defense or and or MMA and a classic example

1069
01:29:52.44 --> 01:29:56.12
I think of that as the is the 50 50 guard

1070
01:29:57.72 --> 01:30:03.56
Where in this position in jujitsu if you don't know jujitsu where if you're in a no rule situation

1071
01:30:03.56 --> 01:30:10.12
You're very vulnerable to a devastating submission called a heel hook and so it's

1072
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.52
But there's there's certain competition rules that don't allow for heel hooks in that position

1073
01:30:16.52 --> 01:30:22.12
So depending on what's kind of school you're at one of them you're gonna get you're gonna be in a in a different situation

1074
01:30:22.52 --> 01:30:27.64
In that in that one position and and you know actually at our school we do we do both

1075
01:30:28.12 --> 01:30:30.36
But do you want to do MMA focus?

1076
01:30:30.36 --> 01:30:36.12
Do you want to do ghee or no ghee and again there's benefits to both those and they're both fun and

1077
01:30:36.84 --> 01:30:38.84
I like training both

1078
01:30:38.84 --> 01:30:46.20
So you kind of kind of think about what you're looking for and then and then bring that into the school and and then go try some classes

1079
01:30:46.20 --> 01:30:49.08
You know take some classes at a school and see what they're like

1080
01:30:49.72 --> 01:30:54.12
What are the other students like you know what kind of atmosphere is it?

1081
01:30:55.16 --> 01:30:59.32
Do they have like the similar goals if you want to compete if that's your goal

1082
01:30:59.32 --> 01:31:00.60
Then

1083
01:31:00.60 --> 01:31:03.96
Are the other people that you talk to or they like yeah, I compete all the time

1084
01:31:04.12 --> 01:31:09.96
There's a tournament coming up or they like yeah, you know we can be sometimes or actually I don't care about competing because there's plenty of people that

1085
01:31:09.96 --> 01:31:12.92
Change the Jitsu they don't care about competing is there

1086
01:31:13.32 --> 01:31:15.88
You know what's the attitude what's is their egos?

1087
01:31:17.24 --> 01:31:22.52
Our people roll if you try to kill you which which 99% of the time in a Jitsu school is not gonna happen

1088
01:31:22.52 --> 01:31:29.40
But it can happen it can happen so what and then and then it's like what was the instructor like is the instructor personal?

1089
01:31:29.40 --> 01:31:34.44
Is it is the instructor you know what we're talking about earlier is he clear as he concise is he understand?

1090
01:31:35.16 --> 01:31:39.000
Can you understand him can you understand the way he's explaining moves now?

1091
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:44.20
There's a you got to give a little leeway there if you jump into a class that's an advanced class

1092
01:31:44.20 --> 01:31:50.52
You're not gonna understand everything you know and people ask me on how to get started on Jitsu and I tell him go immersion training

1093
01:31:50.52 --> 01:31:54.20
Just like a language just get in there and start training and you're gonna get

1094
01:31:54.92 --> 01:31:58.60
Destroyed at first and then you're gonna slowly learn and the next thing

1095
01:31:58.60 --> 01:32:02.12
You know that's a fastest way to learn languages to get immersed in it and do the same thing with Jitsu

1096
01:32:03.56 --> 01:32:05.56
Is the instructor

1097
01:32:05.80 --> 01:32:10.04
Having fun. Is the guy having fun or the girl are they having fun?

1098
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Teaching is it a fun thing because you want you Jitsu to be fun and

1099
01:32:15.56 --> 01:32:18.84
You want the instructor to be having fun because if the instructor's not having fun, well

1100
01:32:18.84 --> 01:32:22.52
Then what you know what are they gonna be like in six months if they're not having fun today

1101
01:32:23.72 --> 01:32:28.84
Then what are they gonna be like in six months? So that's that's another important piece yeah

1102
01:32:29.88 --> 01:32:34.04
When you talk about what what you're looking for you know in Jitsu

1103
01:32:36.44 --> 01:32:38.44
And in my experience

1104
01:32:38.44 --> 01:32:43.48
There's so many elements of it to look for like if you know when you if you say okay

1105
01:32:43.48 --> 01:32:50.76
Am I do I want to learn MMA learning MMA or fighting is the sport of fighting compared to like for example the

1106
01:32:51.40 --> 01:32:53.40
Gracie Academy torrents

1107
01:32:53.72 --> 01:32:59.48
Their Jitsu self defense in regards to fighting getting into a fight or someone attacks you and a fight

1108
01:32:59.48 --> 01:33:01.88
That's way different than training in MMA

1109
01:33:02.28 --> 01:33:07.32
Training MMA is the sport of MMA. You're gonna learn a lot of moves. You're not probably not gonna learn

1110
01:33:07.32 --> 01:33:12.84
Things that a quote unquote an attacker. I mean you you'll you will but it's not focused on that

1111
01:33:12.84 --> 01:33:15.40
You're not gonna learn stuff that an attacker is gonna do to you

1112
01:33:15.80 --> 01:33:20.60
So even that differentiation is just the fighting part alone. Yes, not to mention the competition part

1113
01:33:21.16 --> 01:33:26.52
The ghee the no ghee the you know all these dynamic moves like if you go tenth planet tenth planet convert to like

1114
01:33:27.56 --> 01:33:33.80
Crazy Academy torrents or almost like two different sports almost yeah and they are but at the same time

1115
01:33:34.36 --> 01:33:35.88
You're gonna get

1116
01:33:35.88 --> 01:33:40.52
You're gonna get you Jitsu that that's it and you're gonna get you Jitsu and

1117
01:33:41.72 --> 01:33:43.16
That's the important thing

1118
01:33:43.16 --> 01:33:48.44
Is the GJ2 and just like we talked about the evolution of your principles let your

1119
01:33:48.92 --> 01:33:53.24
You know your game should evolve as well and almost everybody that's never done GJitsu before

1120
01:33:53.24 --> 01:33:57.56
If you said well, why do you want to take GJ2? 90% of them are gonna say oh self defense

1121
01:33:58.12 --> 01:34:00.76
Right and so because you know people say I want to learn to defend myself

1122
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.32
There's not too many people that are gonna be saying you know what I really have become interested in this

1123
01:34:05.32 --> 01:34:12.20
Rebrow aspect of GJ2 which maybe some people that listen to us talk about it or listen to Joe Rogan talk about it

1124
01:34:12.92 --> 01:34:17.96
You know they'll say oh that guy's talking about this thing as if it's a very cerebral experience

1125
01:34:17.96 --> 01:34:21.24
So maybe someone but but most people yeah, I want to learn another fun myself

1126
01:34:21.24 --> 01:34:22.60
I'll phone to make sure you're so

1127
01:34:23.32 --> 01:34:29.72
But you're gonna evolve past that because after six months of training you can handle yourself in the street regardless of you went to tenth planet

1128
01:34:29.72 --> 01:34:36.52
You went to the grace of you can you're gonna be able to handle yourself in the street and so then it becomes an obsession of

1129
01:34:36.84 --> 01:34:38.84
How did that move happen?

1130
01:34:38.84 --> 01:34:45.24
So that's what you got to that's what you got to be ready to evolve and when you're at that point if you go to you know

1131
01:34:45.24 --> 01:34:47.96
school A versus if you went to school B

1132
01:34:49.40 --> 01:34:55.32
Your experience is gonna be a lot different and it's gonna depend on what you're looking for in the beginning

1133
01:34:55.32 --> 01:35:02.68
But nonetheless, yeah, if it is obviously if it's a GJ2 school yeah, that's that that part's not really gonna change

1134
01:35:02.92 --> 01:35:05.32
Yeah, you're gonna learn GJ2 which is a beautiful thing

1135
01:35:07.80 --> 01:35:10.44
The other thing that I gotta say is you got it

1136
01:35:11.24 --> 01:35:13.48
GJ2 as much as I love it

1137
01:35:14.52 --> 01:35:16.52
GJ2 is not

1138
01:35:16.52 --> 01:35:18.52
a religion and

1139
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.12
you know

1140
01:35:20.12 --> 01:35:30.28
The the black belt instructor at the school does not have contact or direct communications with God, right?

1141
01:35:30.68 --> 01:35:32.04
so

1142
01:35:32.04 --> 01:35:38.12
Just I think keep that in mind. It's a person that is trained in a sport for longer than you okay?

1143
01:35:38.12 --> 01:35:39.64
So

1144
01:35:39.64 --> 01:35:44.68
Just keep that in mind. It's not a cult there there should be an open atmosphere in my opinion

1145
01:35:44.68 --> 01:35:47.96
You should be looking for a GJ2 school that has an open atmosphere

1146
01:35:47.96 --> 01:35:51.32
Not a cult controlling atmosphere

1147
01:35:53.24 --> 01:35:57.48
You know that being said and and I said this already respect

1148
01:35:58.60 --> 01:36:03.88
Yes, absolutely you should respect the people that are there and respect your training partners and

1149
01:36:04.52 --> 01:36:06.52
respect your

1150
01:36:06.52 --> 01:36:08.52
instructors for sure, but

1151
01:36:08.84 --> 01:36:13.96
You shouldn't be worshiping them and they shouldn't be expecting you to worship them

1152
01:36:13.96 --> 01:36:20.12
So just be advised because GJ2 it should be fun. It should be friendly. It should be engaging

1153
01:36:20.36 --> 01:36:23.96
The atmosphere should be good and it should be competitive without being cut throat

1154
01:36:24.20 --> 01:36:29.80
You know you you should want to go without fear of having a death match every single night

1155
01:36:30.12 --> 01:36:38.12
Unless that's what you're looking for and you just said that echoing me like I go in every night looking for a death match against being against you against

1156
01:36:38.68 --> 01:36:40.68
Andy, you know against

1157
01:36:40.68 --> 01:36:44.52
Who can crack or grab I mean are true of murderers?

1158
01:36:44.52 --> 01:36:50.84
I'm I'm going in for death match every night and even when I don't want a death match I give it to him because because that's how I'm getting better

1159
01:36:50.84 --> 01:36:52.36
And that's part of my own

1160
01:36:52.36 --> 01:36:54.60
Personal will to say you know what regardless

1161
01:36:55.32 --> 01:36:57.08
I'm in there to

1162
01:36:57.08 --> 01:37:04.36
Put it on the line and and throw it out there and if they get the best of me cool so be it. I learned I got better

1163
01:37:04.84 --> 01:37:08.84
And I I definitely got better than I would if I was either a

1164
01:37:08.84 --> 01:37:14.20
Sitting on the side of the mat be wrong with someone that's not as good or see you stay in at home

1165
01:37:14.92 --> 01:37:22.68
Right, so yeah, that's so interesting how how it really does accommodate who you are like you when you see when you go in looking for it

1166
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
a death match every night

1167
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.000
That totally makes sense because of who you are and who I understand you to be

1168
01:37:29.40 --> 01:37:35.32
But at the same time in the same gym on the same mat. Yeah. Yeah, you can have there's people chilling and rolling

1169
01:37:35.32 --> 01:37:43.000
Who's you know, you know, you know, you know ends up getting his black belt a bunch of knowledge, but he is not going for any death match. Yeah, you know older guy

1170
01:37:44.28 --> 01:37:45.64
That's what so

1171
01:37:45.64 --> 01:37:50.12
In my opinion good about it. Yeah, so eight accommodate so you are so much like me

1172
01:37:50.12 --> 01:37:54.76
I do both like some days death match sure, but most days you do that much like once every

1173
01:37:55.72 --> 01:37:58.44
Every two weeks once every two weeks we get the death match Rebecca

1174
01:37:58.44 --> 01:38:05.64
So yeah, go out there and join you jitsu, but make sure you don't fall into a cult

1175
01:38:08.84 --> 01:38:10.04
Next

1176
01:38:10.04 --> 01:38:16.20
Do you eat fruit and it's so how often and if not why not?

1177
01:38:19.40 --> 01:38:21.40
No

1178
01:38:22.36 --> 01:38:23.40
So

1179
01:38:23.40 --> 01:38:25.80
Okay, do I eat fruit sometimes I eat fruit

1180
01:38:25.80 --> 01:38:29.64
Hmm, but if you would ask me if you should eat fruit

1181
01:38:30.36 --> 01:38:36.60
I would basically say no. I don't recommend it and again this is just a if you talk to

1182
01:38:37.40 --> 01:38:42.04
Dom Dagastino who's a doctor or or mr. Paleo himself Rob Wolf

1183
01:38:43.08 --> 01:38:47.16
If you if you go and listen to his podcast or doctor Peter itia

1184
01:38:47.40 --> 01:38:49.88
You know who I've talked about before these guys

1185
01:38:49.88 --> 01:38:57.24
They know what they're talking about and they will tell you what I'm telling you and these guys will back it up with

1186
01:38:57.80 --> 01:39:00.04
Science upon science upon science so

1187
01:39:00.92 --> 01:39:05.24
fruit carbohydrates spike here in some level just not good for you

1188
01:39:07.16 --> 01:39:14.20
Again, and my an extremists know have some blueberries get your blueberries on get your blackberries on that's awesome

1189
01:39:14.20 --> 01:39:21.88
But take a bunch of fruit and put it with some apple juice and mix it up in a blender and eat you know

1190
01:39:22.84 --> 01:39:28.28
400 grams a carbohydrates and one shot no don't do that. It's not good for you

1191
01:39:30.28 --> 01:39:34.84
Have you ever eaten and I'm not saying when you're on the program so to speak

1192
01:39:35.24 --> 01:39:38.20
Have you ever eaten the whole box of donuts negative?

1193
01:39:38.20 --> 01:39:43.000
Have you ever eaten a bag of Hershey's kisses one time?

1194
01:39:44.20 --> 01:39:49.72
Then it did not make did not work out good so when you say you don't eat fruit that's more of like when you're on the program

1195
01:39:50.36 --> 01:39:53.48
Yeah, and you you're you want to know when I'm on the program

1196
01:39:55.56 --> 01:39:57.56
Yeah, when you're on the now

1197
01:40:00.84 --> 01:40:02.84
But yeah, I

1198
01:40:02.84 --> 01:40:08.60
When when you're when you're trying to eat clean what you should be trying to clean 80% of the time as anyone will tell you

1199
01:40:09.48 --> 01:40:16.84
You know keep it clean and and keep it to you know fat and and protein if you can do it

1200
01:40:19.56 --> 01:40:21.56
A little bit of a subject change when

1201
01:40:21.56 --> 01:40:31.32
If ever is it a good time to blow up that's someone to lose your temper well blow up at someone and lose your temper two different things, right?

1202
01:40:33.48 --> 01:40:37.96
I think is it good? I think I think I think most people would think that they are the same thing

1203
01:40:38.52 --> 01:40:46.12
Losing your temper and blowing up at someone and I can tell you that is almost never good to do that and when I say almost never I mean

1204
01:40:47.48 --> 01:40:50.28
Never with the tiniest caveat

1205
01:40:50.28 --> 01:40:52.28
of

1206
01:40:52.44 --> 01:40:55.88
There is some possible scenarios where it might need to happen

1207
01:40:55.88 --> 01:40:59.08
So if you lose your temper you blow up at somebody

1208
01:40:59.08 --> 01:41:02.28
What do you what are you showing you're showing that you can't

1209
01:41:02.84 --> 01:41:06.36
Control your temper and if you can't control your temper then what can you control?

1210
01:41:06.76 --> 01:41:12.04
Right that and I'm not saying you should show no emotions because if you show no emotions

1211
01:41:12.04 --> 01:41:16.12
And you're a robot and robots can't lead people and people don't follow robots

1212
01:41:16.12 --> 01:41:21.64
So there's some obviously some level of showing emotions is needed

1213
01:41:22.76 --> 01:41:24.04
But if you're

1214
01:41:24.20 --> 01:41:26.20
Losing your temper you're not thinking clearly

1215
01:41:27.88 --> 01:41:32.28
And if you're not thinking clearly because you've lost your temper you can't even read their reactions

1216
01:41:33.08 --> 01:41:40.52
To what you're saying and the fact that you're blowing up is is clouding your own vision the fact that you're losing your temper is

1217
01:41:42.68 --> 01:41:44.68
Clouding your own vision

1218
01:41:44.68 --> 01:41:51.08
And so you got to detach in order to be observant in order to watch what your actions are so

1219
01:41:52.60 --> 01:41:59.56
If you do have to blow up and win okay, so when when is this almost never happen if if you were working for me

1220
01:42:00.84 --> 01:42:02.84
And you did something wrong

1221
01:42:02.84 --> 01:42:08.28
And I said echo and it was grievous. It was like pretty grievous like it could have got someone hurt

1222
01:42:09.16 --> 01:42:11.16
And I said echo hey

1223
01:42:11.16 --> 01:42:18.92
Do you this was bad this is what happened? I don't know what I did wrong that thought the you made you think that would be okay

1224
01:42:18.92 --> 01:42:21.32
But whatever I image I gave you

1225
01:42:22.04 --> 01:42:27.000
That made you think this was okay. I this is the worst mistake I've ever made we can never let this happen again

1226
01:42:27.24 --> 01:42:31.08
Okay, and you're like yeah, okay, and then four days later you do to get

1227
01:42:31.88 --> 01:42:33.88
And I'd come at the same approach

1228
01:42:33.88 --> 01:42:39.40
Maybe a little bit different like echo I don't know if there's anything I could do to make this more clear than I did

1229
01:42:39.40 --> 01:42:44.92
What can I do to make you understand so we might go three or four five iterations maybe one more iteration

1230
01:42:44.92 --> 01:42:47.08
I should say three iterations of

1231
01:42:47.80 --> 01:42:55.16
You not you failing to do what you're supposed to do and getting someone hurt or almost getting someone hurt

1232
01:42:55.64 --> 01:42:56.84
So now I go okay

1233
01:42:56.84 --> 01:43:03.08
He hasn't listened to the indirect approach. He hasn't listened to the direct approach. He hasn't I've taken ownership of it

1234
01:43:03.08 --> 01:43:05.08
He hasn't taken any yet

1235
01:43:05.08 --> 01:43:12.68
I need to come out of a different angle. Okay. I need to lose my temper with him and it's gonna be a calculation and I won't actually lose my temper

1236
01:43:13.24 --> 01:43:20.44
But I will raise my voice. I will get loud. I will point and I will make damn sure

1237
01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.24
That you understand that this infraction that you have committed is

1238
01:43:26.04 --> 01:43:33.56
severe and grievous and can never happen again and that's the situation where I would quote unquote

1239
01:43:33.56 --> 01:43:37.88
Blow up at somebody it is so rare that

1240
01:43:39.80 --> 01:43:48.04
It's so rare that in my military career off the top my head I can remember one and only one incident of this

1241
01:43:48.68 --> 01:43:52.76
Where I actually said you know what this was this was a bad mistake

1242
01:43:53.08 --> 01:43:57.96
I could see where these guys think they might be able to get away with this again in the future

1243
01:43:57.96 --> 01:44:03.56
And I'm gonna make sure that they realize that was it the kind where they it's not like they made the same mistake

1244
01:44:03.56 --> 01:44:06.04
It was more like they chose to do something

1245
01:44:06.04 --> 01:44:09.000
They chose to do something a certain way and in my my

1246
01:44:10.20 --> 01:44:16.44
Assessment of it was that they would do it again if I didn't make it perfectly clear

1247
01:44:17.72 --> 01:44:24.52
That this could never happen again and so I raised my voice. I pointed in the face and

1248
01:44:24.52 --> 01:44:26.52
You know gave them

1249
01:44:27.96 --> 01:44:29.96
20 seconds of

1250
01:44:31.24 --> 01:44:32.28
of

1251
01:44:32.28 --> 01:44:36.76
Intensity and the situation never happened again and they apologize

1252
01:44:39.40 --> 01:44:41.40
But overall

1253
01:44:41.40 --> 01:44:47.72
Not a good thing don't lose your temper people don't do it. Yeah, I would say losing your temper

1254
01:44:48.68 --> 01:44:51.48
Not blowing up at someone losing your temper like for real losing it

1255
01:44:51.48 --> 01:44:59.000
Uh, it's you can be hard it's gonna be hard to think of a situation where that's cool. Yeah, okay, and I'll tell you want to know when I lose my temper

1256
01:44:59.88 --> 01:45:06.84
Or because I'll tell you I do lose my temper it happens once every six months and it is almost always with inanimate objects

1257
01:45:07.48 --> 01:45:09.48
Namely

1258
01:45:09.48 --> 01:45:12.68
objects that print or copy

1259
01:45:14.36 --> 01:45:16.36
or compute in some way

1260
01:45:17.40 --> 01:45:19.40
You know electronics

1261
01:45:19.40 --> 01:45:21.96
Sometimes I I get I get angry. Yeah

1262
01:45:23.24 --> 01:45:25.96
You probably want to keep that in private

1263
01:45:26.76 --> 01:45:35.96
Areas right you know what people to see that yeah like my wife will hear me once every six months you know and she'll come in and she'll be like a printer and

1264
01:45:35.96 --> 01:45:37.64
Oh, yeah

1265
01:45:37.64 --> 01:45:39.64
She says you're stupid. I go. I know

1266
01:45:40.28 --> 01:45:43.40
She goes it doesn't care if you yell at it. You know, I say yeah. I know

1267
01:45:44.28 --> 01:45:46.28
I'm my experience that I found the same thing

1268
01:45:46.28 --> 01:45:49.88
Looking we're looking okay here's the next question

1269
01:45:50.76 --> 01:45:55.32
Your specific lifting workout your weekly training schedule including jiu-jitsu

1270
01:45:58.44 --> 01:46:03.48
This is a big question and this for those of you that do jiu-jitsu out there in the world

1271
01:46:03.48 --> 01:46:06.44
This is like when someone says hey, hey, jockel how do I pass your guard?

1272
01:46:07.48 --> 01:46:12.20
Because I have a good guard and so you know someone that is a blue belt

1273
01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.60
we'll say

1274
01:46:14.60 --> 01:46:19.08
You know a how do I pass your guard you know and they and and literally

1275
01:46:19.96 --> 01:46:21.96
I have guys at the gym that are

1276
01:46:22.84 --> 01:46:28.04
Brown belts and black belts that pass my guard once every six months, you know

1277
01:46:28.52 --> 01:46:30.52
So my guard is good and

1278
01:46:31.16 --> 01:46:33.56
You know here's a blue belt like how do I pass your guard?

1279
01:46:33.80 --> 01:46:36.76
So this this question kind of reminds me of that a little bit

1280
01:46:36.76 --> 01:46:43.72
um specific lifting workout and weekly training schedule on jiu-jitsu. So this is a big ask

1281
01:46:44.44 --> 01:46:47.08
And here's the problem that I have with us

1282
01:46:48.84 --> 01:46:50.84
I'm an individual and

1283
01:46:51.16 --> 01:46:52.36
I have

1284
01:46:52.36 --> 01:46:54.36
Strength and weaknesses. I have

1285
01:46:54.68 --> 01:46:56.20
Whatever little

1286
01:46:56.20 --> 01:46:59.32
Injury thing that I'm working through at a particular time

1287
01:47:00.20 --> 01:47:01.40
I have

1288
01:47:01.40 --> 01:47:05.24
Things that I like to do and I have things that I don't like to do

1289
01:47:05.24 --> 01:47:07.24
I have

1290
01:47:08.04 --> 01:47:15.32
I'm an individual and my workout is for me and and I've taken and I've you know sometimes people

1291
01:47:15.32 --> 01:47:18.52
I'll go on a trip and they'll be a guy that's naffly and you'll say oh, do you know I want to

1292
01:47:19.08 --> 01:47:26.12
I want to go through one your workouts with you and I say okay and I've done that and and I've had guys

1293
01:47:26.12 --> 01:47:33.32
Like almost hospitalized from going through one of my workouts and

1294
01:47:35.32 --> 01:47:42.76
That's not good and then I've had other guys like there's guys out there that will just crush me and a workout you know and especially

1295
01:47:43.08 --> 01:47:45.32
You know there's workouts that I have

1296
01:47:46.36 --> 01:47:52.84
That I could be most of the world in you know there's workouts that I have that I could crush

1297
01:47:52.84 --> 01:47:56.44
Anybody in and then there's workouts that some you know

1298
01:47:57.88 --> 01:48:01.32
Yoga instructor could put me through that would crush me, right?

1299
01:48:01.72 --> 01:48:09.08
So my point is that you get some people that that would die do one of my workouts and you get some people that would it be my one of my workouts

1300
01:48:09.08 --> 01:48:15.16
Is no impact because they're an incredible athlete and so why would either one of them want to do my workout?

1301
01:48:15.40 --> 01:48:18.52
It doesn't make any sense that they would want to do that so

1302
01:48:18.52 --> 01:48:24.12
What I've been trying to think is I get asked all the time. You know what you work out what you work out what you work out

1303
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.44
And so what I've been trying to figure out is how to do this how do I

1304
01:48:30.84 --> 01:48:34.12
How do I communicate what I'm doing and what I've

1305
01:48:35.16 --> 01:48:37.16
What I've been kind of

1306
01:48:38.04 --> 01:48:40.04
Going through the idea in my head is

1307
01:48:41.08 --> 01:48:47.16
Putting together a like an ebook and I actually put this out on Twitter. I was like oh yeah, I'll do an ebook and people like ebook

1308
01:48:47.16 --> 01:48:52.36
Yeah, do it do it so it's an idea that's already been floated out there unfortunately there's not been a lot of time to be right in ebooks

1309
01:48:53.08 --> 01:48:55.32
But what what the focus would be

1310
01:48:56.12 --> 01:49:01.24
Would be yeah like the types of exercise that I do yes, but and you know

1311
01:49:01.48 --> 01:49:05.000
Kind of the numbers of that I that I do of them but more importantly

1312
01:49:05.64 --> 01:49:09.24
Going to a from a leadership perspective is what is the intent?

1313
01:49:09.24 --> 01:49:14.68
What is the commanders intent of my workout? What am I trying to accomplish because

1314
01:49:14.68 --> 01:49:23.80
For you and me to accomplish the same thing is gonna be a different a very different workout right if if I want to

1315
01:49:24.60 --> 01:49:26.60
If I want to take myself to a

1316
01:49:27.64 --> 01:49:31.40
to an anaerobic threshold for a total of

1317
01:49:32.44 --> 01:49:38.76
15 minutes what I would do to get there is very different from what you would do to get there it just it just is

1318
01:49:38.76 --> 01:49:46.60
If I wanted to destroy my legs with heavy squats it would be very different between what you would do and what I would do

1319
01:49:47.32 --> 01:49:54.76
So what's important is is not the actual exercises that I'm doing it's the intent and am I achieving that

1320
01:49:54.76 --> 01:49:59.80
Attent and am I achieving that intent like I can do a

1321
01:50:00.84 --> 01:50:05.72
Decent amount of pull-ups right and and in one of my pull-up workouts

1322
01:50:05.72 --> 01:50:09.88
I might do 500 pull-ups or 300 pull-ups

1323
01:50:10.76 --> 01:50:13.56
There's a lot of people that can't do a hundred pull-ups. So

1324
01:50:14.28 --> 01:50:19.72
Just in the workout right not 300 pull-ups. Yeah, no, I can't do three hundred pull-ups in a row. No

1325
01:50:20.28 --> 01:50:22.28
I wish I could but

1326
01:50:22.28 --> 01:50:23.96
But my intent is to you know

1327
01:50:23.96 --> 01:50:29.96
Max do do a number of maximum sets of pull-ups and then do a number of slow

1328
01:50:30.60 --> 01:50:32.60
You know very good form

1329
01:50:32.60 --> 01:50:39.56
Maximum sets and and the intent is to get stronger at pull-ups by doing you know a

1330
01:50:40.36 --> 01:50:46.84
high number of maximum sets and I think that intent to give to people would say okay

1331
01:50:47.08 --> 01:50:51.16
So that way if Echo's not gonna pause and you go okay well I'm gonna go in and I know what the intent is

1332
01:50:51.16 --> 01:50:56.84
I'm trying to get to a point of failure even on one single pull-up and it might take you only

1333
01:50:56.84 --> 01:51:03.48
15 minutes do that and 30 pull-ups, you know or whatever the case may be and for someone that's really good a rock climber

1334
01:51:03.88 --> 01:51:09.32
It might take them you know 45 minutes and they might be 600 pull-ups deep before they get there

1335
01:51:10.04 --> 01:51:15.48
And so that's kind of the idea I'm batting around. I don't know if people have that really interested in that

1336
01:51:16.04 --> 01:51:18.04
I think a lot of times people

1337
01:51:18.04 --> 01:51:20.04
want

1338
01:51:20.04 --> 01:51:22.04
a formula

1339
01:51:22.04 --> 01:51:30.20
and I don't think I'm gonna give out a formula because the formula is gonna be different for different people at different times and their lives and ages and

1340
01:51:30.92 --> 01:51:35.80
Body weights and you know male or female they're just all so many variables

1341
01:51:36.36 --> 01:51:40.04
But I think if I can give out what the intent of my workouts are

1342
01:51:41.08 --> 01:51:42.36
then

1343
01:51:42.36 --> 01:51:45.96
We're in the right place. Yeah, but those those different

1344
01:51:46.20 --> 01:51:51.72
Variables and stuff that that could very well be the reason that people want your workout because it's to this

1345
01:51:51.72 --> 01:51:54.12
Two things. It's probably more than two but two big things

1346
01:51:55.32 --> 01:52:03.24
That kind of come along with wanting your specific workout and one would be just to kind of immerse myself into what you go through in a workout

1347
01:52:04.36 --> 01:52:08.04
And how does that feel and how do I kind of measure up you know

1348
01:52:09.64 --> 01:52:13.32
And then so those two things like what does it feel like to do a joccal workout?

1349
01:52:13.32 --> 01:52:18.60
You know like how hard is it? You know he's gonna do you know 600 pull-ups in a workout limb

1350
01:52:18.60 --> 01:52:26.12
The lift you know like how does that feel you know is that the hardest thing I've ever done or you know is that just obvious you know these workouts are that hard

1351
01:52:26.12 --> 01:52:28.12
Joccal some punk

1352
01:52:28.12 --> 01:52:30.60
Right well that that's the second part does it you know

1353
01:52:32.20 --> 01:52:36.12
How do I measure up if he does you know 20 sets

1354
01:52:37.40 --> 01:52:39.56
Of squats with whatever weight

1355
01:52:39.88 --> 01:52:44.20
How do I measure up? Can I get all those 20 sets or can I get that weight for 20 sets you know

1356
01:52:44.20 --> 01:52:51.40
So those two things one they just want to immerse themselves in your in your world as far as workouts go and the second one is it's how do I measure up?

1357
01:52:51.40 --> 01:52:56.68
I know that's kind of what I think when when someone's like oh here's here's our workout like those CrossFit workouts

1358
01:52:56.68 --> 01:52:58.68
some of those

1359
01:52:58.68 --> 01:53:02.04
Just mentally I do that like okay this guy's doing

1360
01:53:02.92 --> 01:53:07.80
20 pull-ups in a row like how many can I do you know I measure and then at the same time

1361
01:53:07.80 --> 01:53:12.28
It's like this is you get to understand what these CrossFiters do

1362
01:53:14.52 --> 01:53:20.20
Come here, you know and then like I said they go back and forth that those two things and I think that that that is interesting

1363
01:53:20.68 --> 01:53:24.44
Like if you were to tell me what you did this morning for a workout yeah like I'd be interested

1364
01:53:25.80 --> 01:53:30.92
On top of the fact that oh made that I want to do that workout for me for results for myself

1365
01:53:30.92 --> 01:53:35.08
Right and yet you're right it may or may I'm now all probably have different results

1366
01:53:35.08 --> 01:53:39.08
Even if I do that the same workout is you for you know six months. I might have different results

1367
01:53:39.08 --> 01:53:42.76
but that part about measuring up and just

1368
01:53:43.88 --> 01:53:49.96
Knowing who you are and kind of what you stand for and this is the workout that you do just understanding that I think that's significant too

1369
01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:55.24
Yeah, I would love to tell you that I'm some you know physical specimen but I'm not

1370
01:53:55.80 --> 01:54:00.36
I'm actually not the strongest guy. I'm not the fastest guy. I'm not the most flexible guy

1371
01:54:00.36 --> 01:54:10.36
I try hard and I also am a result of my my physical aptitude is like a

1372
01:54:11.88 --> 01:54:13.88
Is like a is like a

1373
01:54:14.52 --> 01:54:16.52
brownish gray

1374
01:54:17.24 --> 01:54:23.56
paint because I mix up so much stuff in there that I'm the result of

1375
01:54:25.24 --> 01:54:27.24
You know, I'm not bright red

1376
01:54:27.24 --> 01:54:30.52
Right, right, right. I'm not bright blue

1377
01:54:31.08 --> 01:54:35.88
Because those two things you know the strength has been mixed with endurance has been mixed with flexibility

1378
01:54:35.88 --> 01:54:39.88
has been mixed with all these things have been mixed together and I don't want to get

1379
01:54:40.76 --> 01:54:50.60
Too much of any of them yeah because then I'm losing something else and so so I'm kind of this this this kind of average in many

1380
01:54:50.92 --> 01:54:52.92
categories and

1381
01:54:52.92 --> 01:54:58.20
and my numbers in very few of the modern press anybody you're pretty strong now

1382
01:54:58.52 --> 01:55:02.84
Yeah, and and you know like but I'm not one of those people that's on the mat that you go man

1383
01:55:03.64 --> 01:55:05.000
that guy is just

1384
01:55:05.88 --> 01:55:11.000
Freaking strong, you know, well, at least it's hard for me to judge but I know that

1385
01:55:11.96 --> 01:55:15.88
I guess people say oh you're strong. Yeah, sometimes I think that okay

1386
01:55:16.68 --> 01:55:19.48
You're like that guy on the you know you ever play video games? No

1387
01:55:19.48 --> 01:55:23.64
Okay, so let's say you play I don't know football

1388
01:55:23.64 --> 01:55:26.36
Yeah, you play football so when you analyze your players

1389
01:55:26.92 --> 01:55:34.12
It'll have all these attributes speed hands acceleration right and it's like I don't know zero to 10

1390
01:55:34.36 --> 01:55:36.60
So you're the guy who has all like eights

1391
01:55:36.60 --> 01:55:40.20
Yeah, instead of the guy with two tans and then a three yeah, you know

1392
01:55:40.76 --> 01:55:44.84
But like anybody that's listening to this podcast can beat me in a bunch of categories

1393
01:55:44.84 --> 01:55:51.16
Yeah, you know they got tans and some stuff right and and I don't I don't have any tans and anything

1394
01:55:51.16 --> 01:55:53.96
That's okay not everyone can have tans. Yeah

1395
01:55:57.88 --> 01:55:59.88
Next question yeah

1396
01:56:01.88 --> 01:56:07.48
Would you talk more about how you view aggression positives and negatives?

1397
01:56:10.44 --> 01:56:12.44
Well

1398
01:56:12.44 --> 01:56:14.44
I like everything

1399
01:56:16.44 --> 01:56:21.16
In life and in leadership and in your personality

1400
01:56:22.04 --> 01:56:28.20
It has to be balanced aggression has to be balanced and you know one of the one of the things from from the book

1401
01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:34.04
Is you know you got to be aggressive but not overbearing so yeah you got to be aggressive to be a leader

1402
01:56:34.60 --> 01:56:35.88
You've got to be

1403
01:56:36.44 --> 01:56:39.72
Because if you're gonna make things happen you've got to be aggressive to make things happen

1404
01:56:39.72 --> 01:56:45.16
You have to make things happen, you know, I always say people like all they want to make money

1405
01:56:45.16 --> 01:56:48.60
I'm like oh you you just make money you have to take you have to take that money

1406
01:56:48.60 --> 01:56:50.28
It doesn't gonna fall in your house

1407
01:56:50.28 --> 01:56:53.96
Line your lap. It's not gonna make itself you have to take it if that's what your goal is

1408
01:56:54.84 --> 01:57:01.24
Injudjitsu you're you're not gonna get better just by being you have to take the the progression

1409
01:57:01.24 --> 01:57:03.88
You have to take it and make it happen and

1410
01:57:04.12 --> 01:57:06.84
And that's the same thing with anything in life. So so aggression

1411
01:57:06.84 --> 01:57:09.64
Definitely comes into play but

1412
01:57:10.60 --> 01:57:16.12
For instance in a leadership position if you're completely aggressive all the time your

1413
01:57:17.08 --> 01:57:19.08
Subordinance will not want to

1414
01:57:20.36 --> 01:57:23.88
Communicate with you they want to debate with you they want to say hey boss

1415
01:57:23.88 --> 01:57:27.96
I don't agree with what you're saying here because it afraid you're gonna go hey you don't know what you're talking about

1416
01:57:27.96 --> 01:57:32.28
We're gonna go my way out of the highway that's what they're gonna expect so you can't be overbearing

1417
01:57:32.68 --> 01:57:35.48
You know on the mat you can't exhaust yourself with aggression

1418
01:57:35.48 --> 01:57:38.76
And that's one of the things you know that I think from

1419
01:57:40.36 --> 01:57:43.08
Purple the brown belt which is you know your your

1420
01:57:44.20 --> 01:57:49.48
Six to eight years in the game is where people start to calm down and realize that that aggression needs to be

1421
01:57:50.04 --> 01:57:52.20
Tampered and control and people have to relax

1422
01:57:53.24 --> 01:57:54.52
um

1423
01:57:54.52 --> 01:57:56.52
And in combat

1424
01:57:56.52 --> 01:58:00.44
Obviously being aggressive and being this aggressively decisive

1425
01:58:00.44 --> 01:58:05.40
Is important but if you go too far without you're running to your death

1426
01:58:06.76 --> 01:58:11.56
So you have to modulate your aggressive you have to modulate your aggression you can't

1427
01:58:12.12 --> 01:58:14.36
Abuse it you gotta use it but you can't abuse it

1428
01:58:16.36 --> 01:58:19.32
And I don't want to discount aggression in any way

1429
01:58:20.12 --> 01:58:24.60
Because you know I always say that your default mode

1430
01:58:26.52 --> 01:58:28.76
Should be aggression like when you

1431
01:58:28.76 --> 01:58:35.48
When you hit the reset button on your brain you should come out of that reset being aggressive because that that

1432
01:58:36.20 --> 01:58:38.84
Be aggressive be proactive make things happen

1433
01:58:40.84 --> 01:58:45.08
Beyond offense, you know not sitting back and waiting

1434
01:58:45.80 --> 01:58:47.80
To be attacked or waiting

1435
01:58:48.20 --> 01:58:51.80
For a situation to occur no make that situation occur go

1436
01:58:51.80 --> 01:59:01.88
Hmm so that's my view of aggression and and it just has to be balanced and there's of there are still times

1437
01:59:03.56 --> 01:59:07.32
Where you know if you meet aggression with aggression it's actually

1438
01:59:08.36 --> 01:59:14.36
Not good you know you you see this in digital you see this in escalating in when you're either in a

1439
01:59:14.36 --> 01:59:16.04
Comfortation of some kind of somebody

1440
01:59:16.52 --> 01:59:20.28
Aggressively escalating something might be a good choice. It might be a bad choice. You know

1441
01:59:20.28 --> 01:59:25.72
There's always the bully that as soon as you you say hey, you know what I'd love to fight in fact fighting is my favorite thing to do

1442
01:59:25.72 --> 01:59:29.24
Let's go I got it's like no man. I was I was just kidding. So aggression

1443
01:59:30.20 --> 01:59:32.20
Will win there

1444
01:59:32.92 --> 01:59:36.12
Or you know if someone's really being aggressive and you just knock him out

1445
01:59:36.52 --> 01:59:39.24
Well, then that's that's a better handling of the situation

1446
01:59:39.48 --> 01:59:44.44
But there's also times where there's you know maybe there's multiple attackers or someone that's you know you're in the street

1447
01:59:44.44 --> 01:59:50.04
No, it's it's always better in the street to avoid the confrontation, you know

1448
01:59:50.04 --> 01:59:52.68
With his at-person have a knife does that person have a get gun?

1449
01:59:53.08 --> 01:59:57.72
Is does that person have a communicable disease? Does that person have friends around the corner?

1450
01:59:57.96 --> 01:59:59.80
Is that personal lawyer who's gonna sue you?

1451
01:59:59.80 --> 02:00:05.24
I mean there's all these reasons to get into to not get into a fight in the street so

1452
02:00:05.80 --> 02:00:07.80
So aggressively

1453
02:00:08.36 --> 02:00:13.24
Meeting aggression with aggression is probably not that smart. It's probably better to avoid this scenario

1454
02:00:13.24 --> 02:00:16.04
And then and the more time you spend in

1455
02:00:17.32 --> 02:00:23.48
You know in combat sports boxing and doing you just to them the more likely you are to be able to be like, you know what?

1456
02:00:23.48 --> 02:00:26.76
I don't need to prove anything this guy. I'm it's it means nothing to me

1457
02:00:27.16 --> 02:00:32.28
I prove myself on the matter every single day. I got nothing to prove to to Joe drunk idiot over here

1458
02:00:33.48 --> 02:00:40.36
So I think that aggression again. I think your default mood mode should be aggressive

1459
02:00:40.36 --> 02:00:49.48
But make sure that you maintain enough detachment of the situation that you can see if you're being overly aggressive and it's leading you to a bad scenario

1460
02:00:50.92 --> 02:00:54.20
Okay last question you talk about mine control

1461
02:00:55.72 --> 02:00:58.12
Can you expand your thoughts on that subject?

1462
02:01:01.96 --> 02:01:03.96
Mind control

1463
02:01:03.96 --> 02:01:13.40
You know when people think of the word mind control they think of controlling other people's minds and

1464
02:01:14.12 --> 02:01:18.12
And when I think about mind control I think about

1465
02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
controlling your own mind

1466
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
because

1467
02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:24.60
while

1468
02:01:24.60 --> 02:01:27.64
I am obviously a physical person and we spend a lot of this

1469
02:01:28.28 --> 02:01:33.08
Podcast tonight talking about physical culture and I embrace physicality

1470
02:01:33.08 --> 02:01:35.08
but

1471
02:01:35.08 --> 02:01:37.08
We are our minds and

1472
02:01:37.88 --> 02:01:45.000
I'm not gonna be you know going into a Sam Harris philosophical rant on

1473
02:01:46.20 --> 02:01:52.84
What it means and where the you actually is and whether there's a soul or a brain or whatever your heart

1474
02:01:53.40 --> 02:01:54.60
or some other

1475
02:01:54.60 --> 02:01:56.60
conjured up place

1476
02:01:56.60 --> 02:01:58.60
This is what I know

1477
02:01:58.60 --> 02:02:00.60
Is that you

1478
02:02:00.60 --> 02:02:02.60
Your mind

1479
02:02:03.16 --> 02:02:07.96
The thing that is listening and comprehending these words right now that is you

1480
02:02:09.08 --> 02:02:11.48
and that thing that mind

1481
02:02:12.92 --> 02:02:14.92
You can control

1482
02:02:15.72 --> 02:02:17.72
You

1483
02:02:17.72 --> 02:02:22.44
You are the machine and you can control the machine and people ask me

1484
02:02:24.12 --> 02:02:26.12
How do I get tougher

1485
02:02:27.24 --> 02:02:29.24
Be tougher

1486
02:02:29.24 --> 02:02:32.52
They ask me how can I wake up earlier in the morning

1487
02:02:33.80 --> 02:02:36.28
The answer is wake up earlier in the morning

1488
02:02:37.40 --> 02:02:39.80
How can I work out consistently every single day

1489
02:02:41.88 --> 02:02:44.12
Work out consistently every single day

1490
02:02:45.48 --> 02:02:47.48
How can I stop from eating sugar

1491
02:02:49.40 --> 02:02:51.40
Stop eating sugar

1492
02:02:55.16 --> 02:02:57.16
What about the emotions

1493
02:02:57.16 --> 02:03:03.80
How can I stop missing that girl or that guy who whoever whoever broke up with me?

1494
02:03:03.80 --> 02:03:05.80
How can I stop missing them

1495
02:03:08.76 --> 02:03:10.76
Stop missing them

1496
02:03:13.64 --> 02:03:17.40
That is mind control you have that ability

1497
02:03:18.44 --> 02:03:23.08
You just have to assert it you have to decide that you're gonna be in control

1498
02:03:23.08 --> 02:03:27.24
And that you are going to do what you want to do

1499
02:03:29.48 --> 02:03:31.80
weakness doesn't get a vote

1500
02:03:33.16 --> 02:03:35.32
Lazyness they don't get a vote

1501
02:03:37.08 --> 02:03:43.000
Sadness no no vote frustration no vote negativity

1502
02:03:44.76 --> 02:03:46.76
You don't get a vote

1503
02:03:48.12 --> 02:03:49.80
I don't even give my temper a vote

1504
02:03:49.80 --> 02:03:51.80
So

1505
02:03:52.92 --> 02:03:54.92
The next time

1506
02:03:54.92 --> 02:04:00.12
That you're feeling weak or you're feeling lazy or you're feeling soft or you're feeling emotional

1507
02:04:01.40 --> 02:04:03.96
Tell them that they don't get a vote

1508
02:04:05.48 --> 02:04:10.12
Tell them you are declaring martial law on your mind

1509
02:04:11.40 --> 02:04:14.04
You're declaring mind control and

1510
02:04:15.48 --> 02:04:17.48
Impose

1511
02:04:17.48 --> 02:04:19.88
What you want on your brain

1512
02:04:20.76 --> 02:04:25.56
Impose the discipline and the power and the positivity and the will

1513
02:04:28.44 --> 02:04:30.76
And use that mind control

1514
02:04:32.04 --> 02:04:34.04
To move your life

1515
02:04:34.28 --> 02:04:36.28
Where you want it to be

1516
02:04:36.52 --> 02:04:44.04
It's the things I always say get stronger faster smarter quicker friendlier more helpful more driven

1517
02:04:44.04 --> 02:04:48.76
Don't let your mind control you

1518
02:04:51.48 --> 02:04:53.48
Control your mind

1519
02:04:54.84 --> 02:04:56.84
And once you control your mind

1520
02:04:59.32 --> 02:05:01.32
Then

1521
02:05:01.32 --> 02:05:03.32
You can set it free

1522
02:05:06.36 --> 02:05:10.92
And I think we'll close with that for today. Yeah, that's about all of that

1523
02:05:10.92 --> 02:05:12.92
