00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 This is Jocco podcast number 17 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.62 It's been ten years since April 2nd 2006. Ten years since those of us in 4th
00:00:17.62 --> 00:00:23.96 Platoon huddled around the radio outside of an Iraqi army post near Camp Romadi trying
00:00:23.96 --> 00:00:31.32 to make sense of the confused and uncertain radio traffic of the exos calm and firm voice
00:00:31.32 --> 00:00:39.92 from the COC trying to determine what truck had been hit and who was missing.
00:00:39.92 --> 00:00:45.72 Ten years since we drove the road back towards the Gov Center with fear in our minds and
00:00:45.72 --> 00:00:54.60 hate in our hearts knowing we had lost close friends but not yet sure of the names.
00:00:54.60 --> 00:01:00.56 Ten years since I met my platoon commander on the dark and steps of the Gov Center as
00:01:00.56 --> 00:01:06.80 he came down from the COC and confirmed which truck it had been and when I pressed for
00:01:06.80 --> 00:01:13.96 who was gone he simply said all of them.
00:01:13.96 --> 00:01:20.000 He hadn't yet learned that one guy who was a fucking hard ass who wasn't going to let death
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.04 take another marine that day and whose recovery has been an inspiration to all those
00:01:25.04 --> 00:01:29.32 men who know him.
00:01:29.32 --> 00:01:37.92 Ten years since I did my best to pass the word to my team with steadfastness but repeating
00:01:37.92 --> 00:01:45.32 all of them revealing me for the twenty year one year old I was through the tears I was
00:01:45.32 --> 00:01:49.000 trying to hold back.
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.32 Ten years of trying to figure out what their sacrifice meant of shifting views on what
00:01:55.32 --> 00:01:58.96 it was all for in the end.
00:01:58.96 --> 00:02:05.84 That is something that is still a struggle but I've found solace and purpose in these
00:02:05.84 --> 00:02:09.04 facts.
00:02:09.04 --> 00:02:20.56 Staff Sergeant Eric McIntosh, Corporal Scott Procopio, Lance Corporal Kun, Young Kim and
00:02:20.56 --> 00:02:27.20 Hospital Men Giovanni Padilla were men who chose to be part of something bigger than
00:02:27.20 --> 00:02:28.48 themselves.
00:02:28.48 --> 00:02:34.000 Men who chose to enter a profession of crushingly hard work sacrifice and danger all
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.32 for the simple purpose of protecting the men around them.
00:02:39.32 --> 00:02:44.88 Staff Sergeant Mack was the epitome of a fighting marine, a stud who exuded proficiency
00:02:44.88 --> 00:02:50.32 and professionalism, were also being humorous and approachable.
00:02:50.32 --> 00:02:55.36 Procopio is without a doubt when the finest men I've ever had the fortune of meeting,
00:02:55.36 --> 00:03:01.48 a beast of a marine who drove all around him with his enthusiasm and good nature.
00:03:01.48 --> 00:03:06.20 While we were peers, I looked up to him and his natural leadership.
00:03:06.20 --> 00:03:09.36 I still do.
00:03:09.36 --> 00:03:12.76 Kim had a quiet reliability about him.
00:03:12.76 --> 00:03:17.84 Unlike the usual loud, grigiriousness that people tend to associate with grunts, he
00:03:17.84 --> 00:03:20.36 was low key and dependable.
00:03:20.36 --> 00:03:25.20 And for some reason I can still see the way a smile would creep over his face when stupid
00:03:25.20 --> 00:03:30.12 shit was going on and he'd laugh in a way that made it seem like he was seeing a deeper
00:03:30.12 --> 00:03:35.20 joke that you didn't get yet.
00:03:35.20 --> 00:03:40.76 Doc Padillo was new to the company and my memories of him are vague, but the men who knew
00:03:40.76 --> 00:03:47.32 him better describe a young corpsman who was enthusiastic about his job.
00:03:47.32 --> 00:03:52.28 The funny thing with corpsman is that sometimes you don't need to know much to judge their
00:03:52.28 --> 00:03:59.000 character besides the fact that these young men volunteered for one specific duty.
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:09.88 To save the lives of their marines in combat, a more honorable calling is hard to find.
00:04:09.88 --> 00:04:16.68 It's easy for today to be dark to get sucked into the trap of loss, regret, depression,
00:04:16.68 --> 00:04:19.08 and anger.
00:04:19.08 --> 00:04:26.36 It's easy to drown it in liquor under the pretence of having one for the boys.
00:04:26.36 --> 00:04:32.64 This morning as we prepare ourselves to face the tenth of these days, we think of Scott
00:04:32.64 --> 00:04:35.76 and his booming laugh.
00:04:35.76 --> 00:04:40.72 He wouldn't want us sitting around morning like saps, wasting our precious days, burdened
00:04:40.72 --> 00:04:48.08 with his death, like tormented widows out of some 19th century romance fiction.
00:04:48.08 --> 00:04:53.60 He'd remind us that we all joined up for the same reasons.
00:04:53.60 --> 00:04:56.28 We are infantry marines.
00:04:56.28 --> 00:05:01.68 We wanted to fight to energetically meet the enemy in battle and crush him.
00:05:01.68 --> 00:05:09.52 To serve beside men with whom we would build a bond stronger than most will ever know.
00:05:09.52 --> 00:05:18.92 While the politics are complicated and the outcomes unclear, one thing is certain.
00:05:18.92 --> 00:05:23.000 Their sacrifice was not in vain.
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.44 It was the sacrifice that warriors make for each other.
00:05:27.44 --> 00:05:34.48 April 2nd is a day that defines us now, brings us together as brothers.
00:05:34.48 --> 00:05:38.96 It is a day of remembrance and reflection.
00:05:38.96 --> 00:05:46.12 A day that gives us reason to look at our lives and say, look, you son of a bitch.
00:05:46.12 --> 00:05:49.40 This is why you have to live life to the fullest.
00:05:49.40 --> 00:05:55.80 This is why you must fight every day to be a better man.
00:05:55.80 --> 00:06:03.92 And then we must just remember that Scott, Procopio, would call you a pussy for doing the
00:06:03.92 --> 00:06:07.48 opposite.
00:06:07.48 --> 00:06:22.36 For five jins, we will never forget you.
00:06:22.36 --> 00:06:30.60 So that was a post that someone forwarded to me that was on bread.
00:06:30.60 --> 00:06:32.64 It was from an anonymous marine.
00:06:32.64 --> 00:06:39.64 Obviously, this marine was from the three eight marines who we served with in Ramadi, who
00:06:39.64 --> 00:06:45.36 were just outstanding warriors.
00:06:45.36 --> 00:06:58.08 I thought that that tribute not only to the fallen, but also a form of council to his fellow
00:06:58.08 --> 00:07:00.72 marines.
00:07:00.72 --> 00:07:10.28 I just thought that that was an amazing piece of writing and I wanted to share it with everyone.
00:07:10.28 --> 00:07:15.60 April 2nd.
00:07:15.60 --> 00:07:26.08 Now speaking of Ramadi, which, you know, just like this marine, it's something that I think
00:07:26.08 --> 00:07:31.28 about all the time and something that I refer back to a couple of podcasts ago, we talked
00:07:31.28 --> 00:07:39.08 about the band of brothers, the first of the 506, who we also served with in Ramadi.
00:07:39.08 --> 00:07:45.92 And it is a truly hallowed unit.
00:07:45.92 --> 00:07:55.76 And if you've seen the HBO miniseries band of brothers, just a fantastic memorial and representation
00:07:55.76 --> 00:07:59.000 of these American fighting men.
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.88 And the leader of that group, or one of the leaders of easy company and then of the
00:08:05.88 --> 00:08:11.84 battalion, was a guy by the name of Major Dick Winners.
00:08:11.84 --> 00:08:22.76 And he wrote after his, after he came famous, really, from the first book by Stephen
00:08:22.76 --> 00:08:29.76 Ambrose called Band of Brothers and then the miniseries came out, called Band of Brothers.
00:08:29.76 --> 00:08:40.80 He wrote a book, which is called Beyond Band of Brothers, the warm memoirs of Major Dick
00:08:40.80 --> 00:08:49.72 Winners.
00:08:49.72 --> 00:08:54.48 And I got to this book basically because I was going to do Band of Brothers, this Stephen
00:08:54.48 --> 00:08:55.48 Ambrose.
00:08:55.48 --> 00:09:00.64 But as everybody knows, or if you don't know, I like to get the source material from the
00:09:00.64 --> 00:09:02.52 people that were there.
00:09:02.52 --> 00:09:04.68 Stephen Ambrose is a historian.
00:09:04.68 --> 00:09:11.08 And so I identified this book as I was researching more deeply into Band of Brothers.
00:09:11.08 --> 00:09:14.24 I very quickly found this book, ordered it.
00:09:14.24 --> 00:09:18.68 And yeah, there's no doubt.
00:09:18.68 --> 00:09:28.52 So let me kick this off.
00:09:28.52 --> 00:09:33.12 As Battalion operations officer, Hester pointed to where an enemy machine gun was located
00:09:33.12 --> 00:09:38.76 in approximately where a four gun battery of 105s was situated.
00:09:38.76 --> 00:09:40.84 That was all he knew.
00:09:40.84 --> 00:09:45.08 Captain Hester turned to me and said, there's fire along that hedge road there.
00:09:45.08 --> 00:09:47.04 Take care of it.
00:09:47.04 --> 00:09:49.08 That was the sum of my orders.
00:09:49.08 --> 00:09:54.76 No detailed battle plan, no intelligence summary, nothing but a specific task to be accomplished
00:09:54.76 --> 00:09:57.000 without delay.
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.36 Easy company's mission was to silence the battery.
00:10:03.36 --> 00:10:05.80 We talk about the basic principles of combat.
00:10:05.80 --> 00:10:07.92 One of them is simple, clear concise.
00:10:07.92 --> 00:10:08.92 There you go.
00:10:08.92 --> 00:10:09.92 That's your orders.
00:10:09.92 --> 00:10:11.12 There's fire along that hedge road.
00:10:11.12 --> 00:10:12.92 Take care of it.
00:10:12.92 --> 00:10:17.64 And this is also, obviously, an unbelievable example of decentralized command.
00:10:17.64 --> 00:10:19.72 You go solve this problem.
00:10:19.72 --> 00:10:22.08 And his response is I got it.
00:10:22.08 --> 00:10:27.16 Back to the book, conducting a mental estimate of the situation I viewed any infantry
00:10:27.16 --> 00:10:31.60 assault on the battery as a high risk opportunity since our air forces had failed to destroy
00:10:31.60 --> 00:10:37.44 the artillery battery in the preliminary bombardment prior to the seaborn invasion.
00:10:37.44 --> 00:10:43.20 Our key would be initiative and immediate appraisal of the situation, skillful use of the terrain
00:10:43.20 --> 00:10:48.24 and our ability to destroy one gun at a time.
00:10:48.24 --> 00:10:52.64 So you'll notice, he's going to, as soon as he knows that there's multiple guns, what
00:10:52.64 --> 00:10:54.04 does he decide to do?
00:10:54.04 --> 00:10:57.04 One gun at a time, solve one problem at a time.
00:10:57.04 --> 00:11:02.16 Little something we like to call a prioriortized and execute.
00:11:02.16 --> 00:11:07.16 The first thing I did was have everybody drop all equipment except ammunition and grenades.
00:11:07.16 --> 00:11:11.48 So that was all we would need if things went from good to bad.
00:11:11.48 --> 00:11:13.60 To get rid of the things you don't need.
00:11:13.60 --> 00:11:15.56 Focus on this one task that we've got right now.
00:11:15.56 --> 00:11:19.72 It's another prioritized and execute orger right there.
00:11:19.72 --> 00:11:23.56 While the non-commissioned officers prepared the men for the assault, I conducted a hasty
00:11:23.56 --> 00:11:26.48 reconnaissance of the enemy position.
00:11:26.48 --> 00:11:30.84 A leader gains an advantage in combat if he's able to appraise the terrain and the situation
00:11:30.84 --> 00:11:33.40 quickly and correctly.
00:11:33.40 --> 00:11:36.52 Crawling along the hedge road, I moved to a position where I could get a better view of the
00:11:36.52 --> 00:11:37.88 enemy position.
00:11:37.88 --> 00:11:42.04 The guns appear to be set in the trench and the head road covered by a machine gun
00:11:42.04 --> 00:11:44.92 fire from across an open pasture.
00:11:44.92 --> 00:11:49.68 The battery was firing directly down, causeway number two in the direction of Utah Beach
00:11:49.68 --> 00:11:54.40 where the initial waves of the fourth infantry division were already landing.
00:11:54.40 --> 00:12:01.04 So you've got these German guns in an elevated position hammering Utah Beach where the fourth
00:12:01.04 --> 00:12:03.44 infantry division is trying to land right now.
00:12:03.44 --> 00:12:05.88 It's a nightmare.
00:12:05.88 --> 00:12:10.24 It's anticipating that it would be too costly to conduct a frontal attack across an open
00:12:10.24 --> 00:12:11.24 field.
00:12:11.24 --> 00:12:16.08 I determined our chances of success would be greatly enhanced if we could hit the enemy
00:12:16.08 --> 00:12:21.44 on the flank and silence one gun at a time.
00:12:21.44 --> 00:12:24.04 Hit the enemy on the flank.
00:12:24.04 --> 00:12:29.12 Again, these are basic principles and I hate calling, I hate using the word basic, because
00:12:29.12 --> 00:12:30.52 it's fundamentals.
00:12:30.52 --> 00:12:32.64 It's nothing basic about it.
00:12:32.64 --> 00:12:35.48 It's basic, but it's beautiful.
00:12:35.48 --> 00:12:39.36 It's simplicity.
00:12:39.36 --> 00:12:44.56 Returning to the company, I assign specific missions to each man.
00:12:44.56 --> 00:12:47.16 So everybody knows what their task is going to be.
00:12:47.16 --> 00:12:50.52 First I placed one of easy companies to machine guns in a position where they could
00:12:50.52 --> 00:12:54.92 provide a covering fire as we move carefully into position.
00:12:54.92 --> 00:12:57.64 Cover and move.
00:12:57.64 --> 00:13:02.52 Next I divided our detachment into two units, one led by Lieutenant Buck Compton and the
00:13:02.52 --> 00:13:06.08 other remaining with me.
00:13:06.08 --> 00:13:10.88 Compton moved down one headrow with Sergeant Garnier and Malarke to get his close to the
00:13:10.88 --> 00:13:17.36 first gun in the battery as possible, while I led my unit down a parallel headrow.
00:13:17.36 --> 00:13:23.84 Compton also sent Sergeant Slipton and Rainy to conceal position to put flanking fire on
00:13:23.84 --> 00:13:29.44 the enemy while my detachment crawled across the open field to approach the gun first.
00:13:29.44 --> 00:13:34.28 Once you've got multiple covering move situations going on right now, and again to the
00:13:34.28 --> 00:13:40.32 military folks that are listening this, you could breeze through this description and miss
00:13:40.32 --> 00:13:45.16 how important that is, how important and what a great example of covering move this is,
00:13:45.16 --> 00:13:48.36 got to put down that cover fire, you got to put down that cover fire and that's why
00:13:48.36 --> 00:13:52.56 you got to bring them heavy weapons out there, bring those AWs out boys.
00:13:52.56 --> 00:13:56.12 Lots of them.
00:13:56.12 --> 00:14:01.88 In my group, back to the book, when my group consisting of Corporal Joe Toy, PFC Robert
00:14:01.88 --> 00:14:07.08 Pop-I-Win, and private Gerald the Rain from Regimental Headquarters, reached the hedge that
00:14:07.08 --> 00:14:10.04 led to the enemy position and we stopped.
00:14:10.04 --> 00:14:13.88 Here I placed a second machine gun to engage the first gun that was firing point blank
00:14:13.88 --> 00:14:14.88 at us.
00:14:14.88 --> 00:14:18.12 I gave the gun instructions and not to fire unless he saw a definite target so he would
00:14:18.12 --> 00:14:20.48 not give away his position.
00:14:20.48 --> 00:14:22.88 Then we worked our way up to Compton's headrow.
00:14:22.88 --> 00:14:26.56 Here I spotted a German helmet and squeezed off two rounds.
00:14:26.56 --> 00:14:30.36 Later I found a pool of blood at this position, but no Jerry.
00:14:30.36 --> 00:14:33.28 Jerry's term for German.
00:14:33.28 --> 00:14:36.88 Next I sent Compton with two men along the hedge to throw a hand grenades at the enemy
00:14:36.88 --> 00:14:40.56 position while the rest of us supported him with covering fire.
00:14:40.56 --> 00:14:45.92 These guys don't do anything without covering fire.
00:14:45.92 --> 00:14:50.76 I fired occasionally to fill spots when there was a low in the covering fire due to putting
00:14:50.76 --> 00:14:52.80 in new clips.
00:14:52.80 --> 00:14:56.18 Compton took too long getting his detachment into position and we spent more ammunition
00:14:56.18 --> 00:15:00.16 than we should have, but in return we received no enemy fire.
00:15:00.16 --> 00:15:05.12 That covering fire, even though it took too long, but they didn't receive any enemy
00:15:05.12 --> 00:15:07.60 fire because they were laying down that fire.
00:15:07.60 --> 00:15:10.20 They were laying down that covering fire.
00:15:10.20 --> 00:15:14.44 Just as Compton was ready to hurl his grenades, I started across the field with the rest
00:15:14.44 --> 00:15:16.24 of the assault team.
00:15:16.24 --> 00:15:20.28 So that what we jumped in the position together as the grenades exploded.
00:15:20.28 --> 00:15:24.20 And simultaneously we heard additional grenades at the next position.
00:15:24.20 --> 00:15:29.68 In return we received substantial smaller arms fire and grenades from the enemy.
00:15:29.68 --> 00:15:35.84 As we approached the first gun, Papai win was hitting the butt and fell down in the trench.
00:15:35.84 --> 00:15:39.88 Rather than complaining that he was hit, he apologized.
00:15:39.88 --> 00:15:45.08 I'm sorry Lieutenant, I goofed, I goofed, I'm sorry.
00:15:45.08 --> 00:15:49.76 My God, it's beautiful when you think of a guy who is so dedicated to his company that
00:15:49.76 --> 00:15:52.80 he apologizes for getting hit.
00:15:52.80 --> 00:15:59.60 Now he was a soldier hit by enemy fire in Normandy on D Day behind German lines.
00:15:59.60 --> 00:16:05.44 And he's more upset that he'd let his buddies down than he was concerned with his own injury.
00:16:05.44 --> 00:16:07.52 Papai's action.
00:16:07.52 --> 00:16:11.80 Papai's actions spoke for all of us.
00:16:11.80 --> 00:16:18.76 Now I'm fast-forwarding a little bit to get these guns taken down.
00:16:18.76 --> 00:16:24.12 With the entire battery now destroyed, we now withdrew because the machine gun fire that
00:16:24.12 --> 00:16:28.72 we were receiving from the matterhouse and other positions remained intense.
00:16:28.72 --> 00:16:32.68 I pulled our own machine guns out first, then the rifleman.
00:16:32.68 --> 00:16:37.68 I was last to leave, and as I was leaving, I took a final look down the trench, and there
00:16:37.68 --> 00:16:42.08 was one wounded Jerry trying to put a machine gun onto into operation.
00:16:42.08 --> 00:16:44.48 I drilled him through the head.
00:16:44.48 --> 00:16:49.88 On our way back, I came across warn officer, J.G. Andrew Hill, who had been killed working
00:16:49.88 --> 00:16:52.40 his way up to help us.
00:16:52.40 --> 00:16:58.64 In all, we had suffered four dead, six wounded, and we had inflicted 15 dead and 12 captured
00:16:58.64 --> 00:17:00.04 enemy.
00:17:00.04 --> 00:17:04.88 German forces in the vicinity of the battery had outnumbered about 50.
00:17:04.88 --> 00:17:11.64 About three hours passed since I had received the order to dispose of the battery.
00:17:11.64 --> 00:17:16.48 And then, so they take care of that, they conduct some other smaller operations, and then
00:17:16.48 --> 00:17:21.000 it goes to the end of D-Day.
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:29.12 At long last D-Day was over, our success had been to superb leadership at all levels, and
00:17:29.12 --> 00:17:32.80 the training we had experienced prior to the invasion.
00:17:32.80 --> 00:17:38.40 Add luck to the equation, an easy company comprised of formidable team.
00:17:38.40 --> 00:17:41.28 In reflection, we were highly charged.
00:17:41.28 --> 00:17:47.72 We knew what to do, and we conducted ourselves as part of a well-oiled machine.
00:17:47.72 --> 00:17:52.96 Because we were so intimate with each other, I knew the strengths of each of my troopers.
00:17:52.96 --> 00:17:59.28 This is something that he refers back to a lot, was really understanding his men, what
00:17:59.28 --> 00:18:02.36 they were like, what drove them, what their strengths and weaknesses were, so he could
00:18:02.36 --> 00:18:07.000 put them in the correct positions.
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.48 Being allowed us a few minutes of quiet reflection.
00:18:11.48 --> 00:18:16.44 With our outposts in place, I stretched out to catch a few hours of sleep, even though
00:18:16.44 --> 00:18:22.44 the rattle of German small arms fire continued throughout the night.
00:18:22.44 --> 00:18:27.16 Before I dosed off, I did not forget to get on my knees and thank God for helping me
00:18:27.16 --> 00:18:33.08 live through this day, and to ask his help on D-Plus One.
00:18:33.08 --> 00:18:38.84 I would live this war one day at a time, and I promised myself that if I survived,
00:18:38.84 --> 00:18:43.96 I would find a small farm somewhere in Pennsylvania countryside and spend the remainder
00:18:43.96 --> 00:18:54.04 of my life in quiet and peace.
00:18:54.04 --> 00:19:02.80 Now, as you hear about Dick Winners, and that's, I wanted to cover at least one
00:19:02.80 --> 00:19:08.88 engagement, one actual engagement, and that's one of them, so you can kind of see the methodology,
00:19:08.88 --> 00:19:11.52 the principles that he's putting into action.
00:19:11.52 --> 00:19:16.16 But I want to concentrate not so much on the action now, but more on the leadership,
00:19:16.16 --> 00:19:18.48 the leadership pieces of it.
00:19:18.48 --> 00:19:23.88 Although there's still, I still do talk about some of the combat situations that they
00:19:23.88 --> 00:19:29.72 get into, because they were in a war.
00:19:29.72 --> 00:19:34.36 And I want to check in going back a little bit from where he came from, what his mindset,
00:19:34.36 --> 00:19:42.28 what developed it, and he says this, I had a wonderful mother, very conservative.
00:19:42.28 --> 00:19:46.80 She came from a men and night family, but never converted to that faith.
00:19:46.80 --> 00:19:55.40 Honesty and discipline were driven into my head from day one.
00:19:55.40 --> 00:20:00.28 At some point, I'm just going to have to stop like even accenting these things.
00:20:00.28 --> 00:20:10.60 These common themes that are just run through these leaders, not surprisingly, mother was
00:20:10.60 --> 00:20:14.12 undoubtedly one of the most influential people in my life.
00:20:14.12 --> 00:20:21.12 A mother takes a child, she nurtures him, she instills discipline, and she teaches respect.
00:20:21.12 --> 00:20:27.32 My mother was the first one up every morning.
00:20:27.32 --> 00:20:32.60 She prepared breakfast for my sister and in me, and she was the last one to bed every
00:20:32.60 --> 00:20:35.04 evening.
00:20:35.04 --> 00:20:39.64 In many respects, she was the ideal company commander.
00:20:39.64 --> 00:20:44.84 And subconsciously, I'm sure I patterned my own leadership abilities on this remarkable
00:20:44.84 --> 00:20:47.92 woman.
00:20:47.92 --> 00:20:52.72 So it's interesting, all he talked about was that she was the first one to work, and
00:20:52.72 --> 00:20:55.40 she was the last one to leave work, meaning she was the first one up in the morning,
00:20:55.40 --> 00:20:57.44 and she was the last one to leave.
00:20:57.44 --> 00:21:02.04 And with that statement alone, he said that she's the ideal company commander.
00:21:02.04 --> 00:21:07.04 Now, for those of you that aren't the military, your company commander is there's several
00:21:07.04 --> 00:21:11.24 companies in a battalion, there could be three, maybe four, maybe even five, depending on
00:21:11.24 --> 00:21:12.84 the task organization.
00:21:12.84 --> 00:21:17.56 But it's a hundred, maybe 150 guys generally in a company.
00:21:17.56 --> 00:21:23.48 So he's saying that this, that his mom would be an ideal company commander.
00:21:23.48 --> 00:21:24.48 Why?
00:21:24.48 --> 00:21:29.64 Because she wakes up early and has a lot of discipline.
00:21:29.64 --> 00:21:32.56 Newsflash.
00:21:32.56 --> 00:21:37.24 Now, speaking of, yeah, I won't read any more actions.
00:21:37.24 --> 00:21:39.88 Here's another action.
00:21:39.88 --> 00:21:44.68 I positioned men on both sides of the road and prepared to move out in order to secure
00:21:44.68 --> 00:21:45.68 the intersection.
00:21:45.68 --> 00:21:49.72 Here they are on a move, they're got to secure an intersection.
00:21:49.72 --> 00:21:53.80 Lieutenant Wells led first platoon at the head of the company, column.
00:21:53.80 --> 00:21:57.20 Precisely on schedule, I hollowed Wells move out.
00:21:57.20 --> 00:22:01.24 Just as the attack started, a German machine gun located in a building at the foot of the
00:22:01.24 --> 00:22:03.36 hill started to fire up the road.
00:22:03.36 --> 00:22:09.000 The German gun crew is in perfect position at the perfect time to wipe out our entire
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.04 attack.
00:22:11.04 --> 00:22:17.48 On the left hand side of the road, Wells pushed six men towards the intersection.
00:22:17.48 --> 00:22:22.56 They went straight at that intersection and the enemy machine gun.
00:22:22.56 --> 00:22:25.24 The enemy fire, however, was very effective.
00:22:25.24 --> 00:22:30.08 Our men on both sides of the road kept low profiles and the ditches, heads down and they
00:22:30.08 --> 00:22:36.72 frozen place, leaving Wells and his six men assaulting the intersection alone.
00:22:36.72 --> 00:22:42.08 Using my rear, Colonel Strayer and his staff, including Captain Hester and Nixon, could
00:22:42.08 --> 00:22:44.04 see what was happening.
00:22:44.04 --> 00:22:49.92 They in turn were hollowing at me, get them moving, winners get them moving.
00:22:49.92 --> 00:22:55.44 I struggled out of my harness to rid myself of excess equipment so that I could run.
00:22:55.44 --> 00:22:58.48 Since it was obvious what needed to be done.
00:22:58.48 --> 00:23:02.64 So guess what, people aren't moving, people aren't taking action and it's obvious to
00:23:02.64 --> 00:23:04.88 him what needs to be done.
00:23:04.88 --> 00:23:08.000 Looking at the middle of the column on the right hand side of the road, I hollowed, move
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.52 out, move out.
00:23:09.52 --> 00:23:10.80 This did no good.
00:23:10.80 --> 00:23:13.88 Everyone had his heads down.
00:23:13.88 --> 00:23:19.04 This was the one and only time in the war that I really blew my top and physically kicked
00:23:19.04 --> 00:23:20.28 ass.
00:23:20.28 --> 00:23:24.04 I came out of that ditch with only my M1 in hand and haulering.
00:23:24.04 --> 00:23:28.04 I ran to the head of the column, kicked ass on the left side of the road, then ran to the
00:23:28.04 --> 00:23:33.24 right side of the road, back and forth, screaming at my top of my voice, get going.
00:23:33.24 --> 00:23:37.36 I will never forget the surprise and fear on those faces looking up at me.
00:23:37.36 --> 00:23:41.36 With me running around on the road like a wild man, the machine gunner seemed to zero in
00:23:41.36 --> 00:23:42.36 on me.
00:23:42.36 --> 00:23:44.68 I was a wide open target.
00:23:44.68 --> 00:23:49.96 The bullet snapped by and glanced off the road all around me.
00:23:49.96 --> 00:23:54.36 For a short time, I had the feeling of being blessed.
00:23:54.36 --> 00:23:57.88 That feeling didn't last too long for hours to find out in a few minutes that I wasn't
00:23:57.88 --> 00:24:03.000 so blessed.
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.92 And the reason I highlighted that section right there, because in the next literally the next
00:24:07.92 --> 00:24:13.56 page in the book, you get this idea, and again, this is the idea that people have of military
00:24:13.56 --> 00:24:14.56 leaders.
00:24:14.56 --> 00:24:18.12 Is that they're these hard ass guys and these kick ass guys that are running around
00:24:18.12 --> 00:24:22.20 and yelling like what I just read.
00:24:22.20 --> 00:24:30.64 I wanted to highlight that because now we fast forward one page in the book.
00:24:30.64 --> 00:24:35.52 And taking the intersection, easy companies sustain ten casualties.
00:24:35.52 --> 00:24:40.76 Among our wounded were Sergeant Lippden, Ed Tipper, and Burr Smith.
00:24:40.76 --> 00:24:46.48 Another casualty was Private Albert Belive, who was in the aid station sitting with his
00:24:46.48 --> 00:24:52.68 back against the wall when I entered to have my wound cleaned, because by the way, major
00:24:52.68 --> 00:24:54.28 winners got hit.
00:24:54.28 --> 00:24:57.08 And so he's in there getting his wound cleaned.
00:24:57.08 --> 00:25:03.000 Now he's looking at Private Blife, and he says here, I did not notice any wounds.
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.52 So I asked how are you doing, Blife?
00:25:06.52 --> 00:25:10.80 I can't see, I can't see he replied.
00:25:10.80 --> 00:25:15.32 I remember trying to comfort him by saying it's okay, Blife, relax, they'll have you out
00:25:15.32 --> 00:25:19.40 of your soon and they'll send you back to England.
00:25:19.40 --> 00:25:24.92 As I started to move away, Blife stood up suddenly saying, I'm okay, I'm okay, I can
00:25:24.92 --> 00:25:28.12 see now.
00:25:28.12 --> 00:25:32.20 As soon as Blife regained his vision, he immediately returned to duty.
00:25:32.20 --> 00:25:37.08 If you think about that for a minute, that boy had been paralyzed by fear.
00:25:37.08 --> 00:25:41.64 Yet he had the guts and dedication to stick to his buddies in easy company.
00:25:41.64 --> 00:25:45.76 As soon as he relaxed and pulled himself together, he returned to the front, rather than
00:25:45.76 --> 00:25:50.68 taking the easy way out, with an evacuation.
00:25:50.68 --> 00:25:58.68 Sometimes all a soldier needed was a calm voice reassuring him that everything was fine.
00:25:58.68 --> 00:26:03.44 In Blife's case, he rejoined the company and was wounded in action during the upcoming
00:26:03.44 --> 00:26:05.000 fight.
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.68 After World War II, he served in the 187th Airborne Regiment in the Korean War where
00:26:10.68 --> 00:26:14.68 he was awarded a silver star and the bronze star.
00:26:14.68 --> 00:26:20.64 By the time he retired from military service, Blife was a company first sergeant.
00:26:20.64 --> 00:26:28.08 So, the contrast there is that, instead of pulling a general George Patton and slapping
00:26:28.08 --> 00:26:31.88 the guy around and saying, you're not wounded, he realized what he needed to do, which was
00:26:31.88 --> 00:26:32.88 just comfort the guy.
00:26:32.88 --> 00:26:33.88 Say, hey, listen, everything's okay.
00:26:33.88 --> 00:26:39.76 We'll get you on a plane, we'll get you back to England, just take it easy.
00:26:39.76 --> 00:26:45.92 Here's a section that I'm just going to jump too quickly when he's talking about the confusion
00:26:45.92 --> 00:26:52.36 getting in the confusion getting our men into position was as bad as we were to ever see.
00:26:52.36 --> 00:26:57.92 One time I found easy company troops firing into troops of another battalion.
00:26:57.92 --> 00:27:06.08 Later we had some tanks show up for support and they began firing into our own mind.
00:27:06.08 --> 00:27:14.24 So that's Blue On Blue, it's Fratur side and we talk about it in our book and it's one
00:27:14.24 --> 00:27:18.04 of those things that they usually don't show it.
00:27:18.04 --> 00:27:24.04 They usually don't portray it because it's hard to believe that things can get that confusing,
00:27:24.04 --> 00:27:26.96 but they do.
00:27:26.96 --> 00:27:30.56 And it goes all the way back.
00:27:30.56 --> 00:27:36.32 And clear example right there.
00:27:36.32 --> 00:27:42.56 Now we're going back to Blife and this is an interesting commentary on training.
00:27:42.56 --> 00:27:48.40 And one of our daylight patrols led by Sergeant Garnier, Blife was point man when he spotted
00:27:48.40 --> 00:27:52.24 a German sniper in a tree.
00:27:52.24 --> 00:27:58.88 Just as he did in training, he automatically said bang, bang instead of dropping to the side
00:27:58.88 --> 00:28:02.36 of the road and putting his rifle on the sniper.
00:28:02.36 --> 00:28:08.68 So if you can imagine you're back in America or when they were doing their pre-attack training
00:28:08.68 --> 00:28:12.08 in England and they weren't using real bullets, so they're out on a patrol and if they
00:28:12.08 --> 00:28:14.60 saw something, they'd go bang, bang.
00:28:14.60 --> 00:28:18.40 Well, that's literally what the guy did.
00:28:18.40 --> 00:28:23.04 The German reacted first and shot Blife through the collarbone, the rest of the patrol,
00:28:23.04 --> 00:28:28.000 recovered Blife and then withdrew to easy lines.
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:36.32 So again, military people that are listening, law enforcement, you train how you fight,
00:28:36.32 --> 00:28:38.08 and you fight how you train.
00:28:38.08 --> 00:28:40.96 So you just gotta keep that in mind all the time.
00:28:40.96 --> 00:28:46.04 If you're giving yourself some kind of a training scar by doing something like a lip gun,
00:28:46.04 --> 00:28:47.64 we actually did this in the sealed team.
00:28:47.64 --> 00:28:50.20 Lip gun, that's what we call it, it's embarrassing.
00:28:50.20 --> 00:28:52.44 In my early days, that's what we want to have a choice.
00:28:52.44 --> 00:28:53.44 Like what you make sound like a band.
00:28:53.44 --> 00:28:55.44 Like bang, bang, yeah, you're mouth.
00:28:55.44 --> 00:28:56.44 Yeah.
00:28:56.44 --> 00:29:03.88 And thankfully now they have unbelievable good systems, the paintball type systems that go in
00:29:03.88 --> 00:29:14.84 our real guns, the laser tag type systems, so we don't have to use lip guns.
00:29:14.84 --> 00:29:18.28 Back to the book, next sector.
00:29:18.28 --> 00:29:23.08 Success breeds confidence and easy company success and normandy instilled the confidence
00:29:23.08 --> 00:29:27.88 that they would need to succeed and live to fight another day.
00:29:27.88 --> 00:29:35.32 At the same time, I could not help but think that had I trained the men harder.
00:29:35.32 --> 00:29:42.40 If I had done a better job, maybe more of my men would have come home.
00:29:42.40 --> 00:29:47.20 That's something a leader is always going to be thinking, always going to be thinking that.
00:29:47.20 --> 00:29:48.48 What could we have done better?
00:29:48.48 --> 00:29:52.04 What could I have done better?
00:29:52.04 --> 00:29:57.56 Now they get back to England, they're taking a break, they get pulled off the line,
00:29:57.56 --> 00:30:00.04 and he's back in Al, and Aldborn.
00:30:00.04 --> 00:30:10.48 He's just talking about he's sort of reflecting back on his initial push into Europe.
00:30:10.48 --> 00:30:15.80 You know you got guys there out drinking and doing whatever they're doing, and he says,
00:30:15.80 --> 00:30:19.72 ask for myself, I relaxed the best I could.
00:30:19.72 --> 00:30:24.96 Combat had made me tense, particularly since my decisions now meant life or death to the
00:30:24.96 --> 00:30:28.28 members of my command.
00:30:28.28 --> 00:30:34.60 Commanding soldiers and combat requires a personal detachment from the men themselves.
00:30:34.60 --> 00:30:40.52 In a sense, command is the loneliest job in the world.
00:30:40.52 --> 00:30:47.68 Looking at myself in the mirror, I could see how much I had changed, I could sense it.
00:30:47.68 --> 00:30:52.04 Another thing that affected me was the importance of discipline.
00:30:52.04 --> 00:31:03.08 The necessity of instilling discipline to my troops and getting the job done in combat.
00:31:03.08 --> 00:31:08.36 In an attempt to escape the tension that combat had caused, I developed a heavier than
00:31:08.36 --> 00:31:14.04 usual exercise regimen, and I attended church on a regular basis.
00:31:14.04 --> 00:31:19.04 There were only a few days that I didn't run two to three miles, two 80 pushups, 60
00:31:19.04 --> 00:31:23.32 situps on a foot locker, that a couple of splits and some leg and trunk exercises after
00:31:23.32 --> 00:31:26.000 the day's work was over.
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.92 As a result, I kept in pretty good shape, not what I'd call wrestling shape, but good
00:31:30.92 --> 00:31:33.64 enough for army work.
00:31:33.64 --> 00:31:46.000 Physical activity kept me mentally alert, built my endurance, and kept me supple.
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.08 You got to do it.
00:31:48.08 --> 00:31:50.68 You got to have that discipline and you got to work out.
00:31:50.68 --> 00:31:52.56 You got to do it every day.
00:31:52.56 --> 00:31:55.000 It's that important.
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.84 Yeah, see how I mentioned how it kept him mentally sharp.
00:31:58.84 --> 00:31:59.84 It absolutely does.
00:31:59.84 --> 00:32:05.20 Yeah, it's it that before that's one of the few things that you can do that affects everything
00:32:05.20 --> 00:32:07.32 and everything in life.
00:32:07.32 --> 00:32:08.48 You are correct.
00:32:08.48 --> 00:32:13.48 I think people a lot of time in regards to exercise people think, well, exercise, that's
00:32:13.48 --> 00:32:14.76 for a certain kind of person.
00:32:14.76 --> 00:32:17.52 You know, maybe a fitness person or something like that.
00:32:17.52 --> 00:32:19.20 That's for a dumb joke, right?
00:32:19.20 --> 00:32:20.20 I'm a smart person.
00:32:20.20 --> 00:32:22.20 I'm not going to exercise long answer.
00:32:22.20 --> 00:32:26.16 Yeah, I think nowadays people are more hip to it for sure, but do you say hip?
00:32:26.16 --> 00:32:30.000 Hitman, down, down with the cause, the new stuff.
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.60 But yeah, it is interesting how these leaders back then, they knew that.
00:32:37.60 --> 00:32:41.68 Yep, even though there's been no, even though at that time there's been no scientific
00:32:41.68 --> 00:32:44.44 study, their scientific study is now that proved it.
00:32:44.44 --> 00:32:45.44 He didn't know that.
00:32:45.44 --> 00:32:46.44 He just knew it.
00:32:46.44 --> 00:32:47.44 Yeah, he felt that he lived it.
00:32:47.44 --> 00:32:56.20 Now, they're in a position now, again, I'm just fast forward.
00:32:56.20 --> 00:32:59.64 And even though I said I wasn't going to cover too much in the combat, I'm covering
00:32:59.64 --> 00:33:00.64 the combat.
00:33:00.64 --> 00:33:06.44 Because the combat is what puts these people in these leadership positions.
00:33:06.44 --> 00:33:11.56 Combat is the ultimate teacher, the harshest teacher, and the teachers you lessons that you
00:33:11.56 --> 00:33:15.52 do not forget.
00:33:15.52 --> 00:33:20.04 So they're around this village of foi, which is a village that was held by the Germans
00:33:20.04 --> 00:33:22.56 and they'd been waiting.
00:33:22.56 --> 00:33:27.36 And they'd been a while.
00:33:27.36 --> 00:33:34.92 And here's winners talking about, here's winners talking about his troops.
00:33:34.92 --> 00:33:38.08 They were now completely exhausted.
00:33:38.08 --> 00:33:43.96 They had had no hot food, little sleep, no rest, constant tension, and the pressure of
00:33:43.96 --> 00:33:46.08 combat.
00:33:46.08 --> 00:33:51.20 The worst time was night when temperatures plummeted and fog covered the battlefield until
00:33:51.20 --> 00:33:53.32 mid-delate morning.
00:33:53.32 --> 00:33:59.16 The uncertainty of what lay just yards ahead in the next treeline was sufficient to break
00:33:59.16 --> 00:34:01.80 ordinary men.
00:34:01.80 --> 00:34:07.32 Not surprisingly, the men became physically exhausted.
00:34:07.32 --> 00:34:13.64 Physical exhaustion leads to mental exhaustion, which in turn causes men to lose discipline.
00:34:13.64 --> 00:34:20.76 Laws of self-discipline then produces combat fatigue.
00:34:20.76 --> 00:34:25.24 Self-discipline keeps a soldier doing his job.
00:34:25.24 --> 00:34:29.80 Without it, he loses his pride, and he loses the importance of self-respecting the
00:34:29.80 --> 00:34:32.96 eyes of his fellow soldiers.
00:34:32.96 --> 00:34:38.28 It is pride that keeps a soldier going and keeps him in the fight.
00:34:38.28 --> 00:34:45.88 This is what I feared I would lose, the loss of will to measure up to my men.
00:34:45.88 --> 00:34:50.96 After seeing others break down, you wondered who is next, and you started taking a hard look
00:34:50.96 --> 00:34:54.20 at yourself.
00:34:54.20 --> 00:35:02.72 I often wondered why I didn't break under the strain of combat.
00:35:02.72 --> 00:35:07.84 One factor undoubtedly lay in the fact that my battalion headquarters lay 75 yards behind
00:35:07.84 --> 00:35:10.96 the Ford Foxholes.
00:35:10.96 --> 00:35:14.68 No longer was I under enemy observation.
00:35:14.68 --> 00:35:18.80 Consequently, I was able to concentrate on my duties without fear of enemy small arms
00:35:18.80 --> 00:35:20.76 fire.
00:35:20.76 --> 00:35:25.12 Another factor was undoubtedly my physical conditioning.
00:35:25.12 --> 00:35:28.52 I don't think there was a man in the battalion who was in better physical shape than I
00:35:28.52 --> 00:35:30.52 was.
00:35:30.52 --> 00:35:35.92 My responsibility to ensure the safety of the soldiers also hardened me to cope with the daily
00:35:35.92 --> 00:35:41.60 stress of combat.
00:35:41.60 --> 00:35:45.16 One last observation on combat fatigue.
00:35:45.16 --> 00:35:50.72 When you see a man break, he usually slams his helmet down and messes up his hair.
00:35:50.72 --> 00:35:55.28 I don't know if it's conscious or unconscious, but a soldier goes to his head and massages
00:35:55.28 --> 00:35:59.04 his head, shakes it, and then he's gone.
00:35:59.04 --> 00:36:02.80 You can talk to him all you want, but he cannot hear you.
00:36:02.80 --> 00:36:08.40 When he reaches that point, the best thing for everybody is just to let him take a walk.
00:36:08.40 --> 00:36:11.92 Combat exhaustion occurs instantaneously.
00:36:11.92 --> 00:36:16.44 You don't plan to become a combat fatigue casualty.
00:36:16.44 --> 00:36:19.16 How do you prevent combat fatigue?
00:36:19.16 --> 00:36:24.32 You talk to your troops and make some excuse to pull a soldier off the front line.
00:36:24.32 --> 00:36:29.08 Of course pulling a soldier off the front line increases the stress of those who remain,
00:36:29.08 --> 00:36:31.96 but is a necessary trade-off.
00:36:31.96 --> 00:36:37.04 I often asked a soldier who might saw on the verge of a breakdown, how about coming back
00:36:37.04 --> 00:36:40.76 with me to the CP to help out for a couple of days?
00:36:40.76 --> 00:36:45.08 In this manner, you invent a reason for pulling a guy from the line without damaging his
00:36:45.08 --> 00:36:46.52 psyche.
00:36:46.52 --> 00:36:53.96 So, bunch of stuff there on combat fatigue.
00:36:53.96 --> 00:36:58.52 I'm not saying that you're going to see combat fatigue in the civilian world.
00:36:58.52 --> 00:37:02.84 But you do see people get stressed out in business.
00:37:02.84 --> 00:37:08.64 I thought that that common about people messing up their hair and grabbing their head.
00:37:08.64 --> 00:37:14.28 That's a really good indicator of when people are breaking.
00:37:14.28 --> 00:37:18.28 I'll tell you one of the things, this is something that we talk about of the book, as
00:37:18.28 --> 00:37:28.44 well as for us, the guys that had the most resistance to combat fatigue with a
00:37:28.44 --> 00:37:35.04 guy that were most inturately involved in the planning of the operations.
00:37:35.04 --> 00:37:37.52 They felt like they had control.
00:37:37.52 --> 00:37:39.76 Unfortunately, we didn't know this.
00:37:39.76 --> 00:37:44.44 We had guys that weren't involved, maybe they were new guys, or they just weren't that
00:37:44.44 --> 00:37:46.40 involved in the planning or whatever.
00:37:46.40 --> 00:37:48.96 All they were getting told was like, hey, get your gear on.
00:37:48.96 --> 00:37:49.96 You're going out again.
00:37:49.96 --> 00:37:50.96 Come back from that operation.
00:37:50.96 --> 00:37:51.96 Hey, get your gear on.
00:37:51.96 --> 00:37:52.96 Come back from that operation.
00:37:52.96 --> 00:37:53.96 Hey, get your gear on.
00:37:53.96 --> 00:37:55.68 You're going out again.
00:37:55.68 --> 00:37:58.84 Those guys that didn't really get involved in the planning, it was harder for them because
00:37:58.84 --> 00:38:00.48 they didn't feel like they had any control.
00:38:00.48 --> 00:38:02.48 And they didn't see the risk mitigation that was happening.
00:38:02.48 --> 00:38:04.20 And they didn't understand the strategy well enough.
00:38:04.20 --> 00:38:05.20 Why?
00:38:05.20 --> 00:38:06.64 Because I didn't tell them, my fault.
00:38:06.64 --> 00:38:09.68 You know, I should have been more engaged than I should have explained to them the impact
00:38:09.68 --> 00:38:10.68 that they were having.
00:38:10.68 --> 00:38:13.000 I should have explained to them the overall strategic picture.
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000 And I tried to do that.
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.32 And I thought I did it, but I didn't do well enough.
00:38:17.32 --> 00:38:22.44 And those are the guys that definitely were the most stressed out.
00:38:22.44 --> 00:38:25.64 So leaders out there, it's just another reason.
00:38:25.64 --> 00:38:31.24 It's another reason to tell people why they're doing what they're doing and get them involved
00:38:31.24 --> 00:38:34.84 in the planning and get them ownership of the planning.
00:38:34.84 --> 00:38:37.84 So they feel like they have some control over it.
00:38:37.84 --> 00:38:38.84 Interesting.
00:38:38.84 --> 00:38:42.88 Oh, they mentioned how they dealt with that when they'd pull them off the line, right?
00:38:42.88 --> 00:38:45.40 But they wouldn't just be like straight up straight.
00:38:45.40 --> 00:38:46.88 Don't, hey, you're messing up.
00:38:46.88 --> 00:38:47.88 Get off the line.
00:38:47.88 --> 00:38:48.88 No.
00:38:48.88 --> 00:38:52.40 It was like they pulled them off the line in a way that wouldn't, wouldn't mess them up.
00:38:52.40 --> 00:38:54.08 Do we need you to take care of the supply issue?
00:38:54.08 --> 00:38:55.08 Yeah.
00:38:55.08 --> 00:38:56.48 Go back there for me and get this figured out.
00:38:56.48 --> 00:38:57.48 Yeah.
00:38:57.48 --> 00:38:58.48 Okay, I'll do it.
00:38:58.48 --> 00:39:00.04 Give them a break, give them a rest.
00:39:00.04 --> 00:39:01.36 This is something hack worth talked about too.
00:39:01.36 --> 00:39:05.60 I mean, hack worth says, you know, about face, you know, he talks about he just says,
00:39:05.60 --> 00:39:08.16 hey, everyone's got a cup of certain size cup.
00:39:08.16 --> 00:39:12.36 Some people have a bigger cup than others, but when the cup gets filled up, that's it.
00:39:12.36 --> 00:39:13.36 They're done.
00:39:13.36 --> 00:39:16.16 And if you let the cup get filled up and overflow, then they're done forever.
00:39:16.16 --> 00:39:19.60 But if you can catch it beforehand, they can go back a little bit and drain their cup out.
00:39:19.60 --> 00:39:23.12 That's exactly what you talk about when you say manipulation.
00:39:23.12 --> 00:39:24.12 All right.
00:39:24.12 --> 00:39:28.52 You tell them just in a kind of a gingerly kind of way.
00:39:28.52 --> 00:39:31.68 You know, make them signed on to the whole situation.
00:39:31.68 --> 00:39:32.68 Yeah.
00:39:32.68 --> 00:39:38.08 Yeah, no doubt about it.
00:39:38.08 --> 00:39:42.04 This is going back to his discipline.
00:39:42.04 --> 00:39:48.04 My routine was to shave every morning and then to inspect the line.
00:39:48.04 --> 00:39:52.76 And in retrospect, shaving in the bitter cold was pretty ridiculous.
00:39:52.76 --> 00:39:57.56 But the practice had originated with one of my first meetings with Colonel Sink.
00:39:57.56 --> 00:40:01.96 At Tacoa, Sink had required us to shave every morning.
00:40:01.96 --> 00:40:04.56 He said, you shave every morning for the men.
00:40:04.56 --> 00:40:07.48 And if you want to, shave every evening for the women.
00:40:07.48 --> 00:40:09.32 But that's up to you.
00:40:09.32 --> 00:40:13.20 But I want you to said an example.
00:40:13.20 --> 00:40:15.60 He was absolutely right.
00:40:15.60 --> 00:40:19.92 I remember one morning when we prepared for our attack on foi.
00:40:19.92 --> 00:40:23.76 I got up in the middle of the night to shave before getting something to eat.
00:40:23.76 --> 00:40:26.76 In the process, I cut myself up pretty badly.
00:40:26.76 --> 00:40:29.20 I must have looked like hell.
00:40:29.20 --> 00:40:33.52 When Colonel Sink arrived to check on us before the attack commenced, he took one look
00:40:33.52 --> 00:40:36.72 at me and had a huge smile on his face.
00:40:36.72 --> 00:40:41.28 I later, I realized later that he was laughing at me for shaving on that bitterly cold
00:40:41.28 --> 00:40:42.28 morning.
00:40:42.28 --> 00:40:46.28 But that was one of the things I did to set an example for the men.
00:40:46.28 --> 00:40:50.96 Shave in the morning and once in a while, I would strip to the waist and give myself a French
00:40:50.96 --> 00:40:54.88 wash, a routine that caught everyone's attention.
00:40:54.88 --> 00:41:00.40 I did this for one reason and one reason only to get the men's attention and to let them
00:41:00.40 --> 00:41:04.44 know that I was going to be around for a while and this wasn't as bad as they thought
00:41:04.44 --> 00:41:06.44 it was going to be.
00:41:06.44 --> 00:41:11.08 Make the best of it.
00:41:11.08 --> 00:41:18.56 And what I like about that is his total awareness of the impact that he's having on his
00:41:18.56 --> 00:41:19.56 men.
00:41:19.56 --> 00:41:22.76 He knows that they are watching them and if you're in a leadership position, you've got to
00:41:22.76 --> 00:41:25.32 recognize that people are watching you.
00:41:25.32 --> 00:41:26.32 Parents.
00:41:26.32 --> 00:41:27.32 Yeah.
00:41:27.32 --> 00:41:31.32 If you're a parent, you've got to realize that person that you're leading called your child,
00:41:31.32 --> 00:41:32.32 they're watching you.
00:41:32.32 --> 00:41:37.44 It's more critical than most of the time anyway, than what you say.
00:41:37.44 --> 00:41:42.76 And people will make this excuse saying that they say, hey, do what I say, not what I
00:41:42.76 --> 00:41:43.76 do.
00:41:43.76 --> 00:41:44.76 Meanwhile, you're doing all this stuff.
00:41:44.76 --> 00:41:48.84 That's not how they're going to be like, oh, that's just something you say.
00:41:48.84 --> 00:41:50.44 Meanwhile, this is how you do it.
00:41:50.44 --> 00:41:53.08 Apparently, mom and dad are doing it this way.
00:41:53.08 --> 00:41:54.08 That's the way it's done.
00:41:54.08 --> 00:41:55.08 We're going to do this.
00:41:55.08 --> 00:41:56.08 Yeah.
00:41:56.08 --> 00:42:03.52 You've got to do the right thing and people are watching you when you're in a leadership
00:42:03.52 --> 00:42:09.000 position, you are being watched, you are being emulated.
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.56 Your emotions are being mimicked.
00:42:10.56 --> 00:42:11.92 You don't know that.
00:42:11.92 --> 00:42:16.52 You might not sense that, but your emotions are being mimicked.
00:42:16.52 --> 00:42:17.76 You get into a panic mode.
00:42:17.76 --> 00:42:22.40 You're going to have a bunch of people panicking.
00:42:22.40 --> 00:42:24.40 You stay calm.
00:42:24.40 --> 00:42:26.32 Your people are going to stay calm.
00:42:26.32 --> 00:42:27.32 You get crazy.
00:42:27.32 --> 00:42:28.84 Your people are going to go crazy.
00:42:28.84 --> 00:42:31.60 Your people are watching you so set the good example.
00:42:31.60 --> 00:42:39.000 And one of the premier examples he's setting is he's maintaining the discipline.
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.84 Now this is actually section.
00:42:40.84 --> 00:42:49.28 I don't, it's, it's very interesting because we had, I had made a comment on the podcast
00:42:49.28 --> 00:42:50.76 about, hey, what do you do?
00:42:50.76 --> 00:42:54.40 Someone asked, what do you do if you get told to do something and you don't believe
00:42:54.40 --> 00:42:55.40 in it.
00:42:55.40 --> 00:42:56.40 Right.
00:42:56.40 --> 00:43:00.60 And you know, I went through a big gray area and said, look, there's some gray area
00:43:00.60 --> 00:43:01.60 there.
00:43:01.60 --> 00:43:05.16 And if it's just something small that you can ask to do and you just, if you decide
00:43:05.16 --> 00:43:08.44 you're going to lay down the wall right now and bang your fist on the table and say, I'm
00:43:08.44 --> 00:43:09.44 not going to do that.
00:43:09.44 --> 00:43:12.32 Well, then you're going to get fired.
00:43:12.32 --> 00:43:15.08 And now someone else is going to have to come in there and do that thing that you've
00:43:15.08 --> 00:43:16.44 been asked to do.
00:43:16.44 --> 00:43:20.32 And I had one person on Twitter that kind of went back and forth with me.
00:43:20.32 --> 00:43:26.40 And, you know, he said, hey, it does make an impact when you walk away.
00:43:26.40 --> 00:43:27.40 And I agreed with him.
00:43:27.40 --> 00:43:28.40 I said, yes, I know.
00:43:28.40 --> 00:43:31.44 I'm not trying to say it doesn't make an impact when you walk away because it certainly
00:43:31.44 --> 00:43:32.96 does.
00:43:32.96 --> 00:43:42.48 But there's cases where it has more of an impact if you stay and you stay in the game.
00:43:42.48 --> 00:43:47.28 So this is an example right here, a pretty shocking example because we have a guy that's
00:43:47.28 --> 00:43:56.76 100% on board and is, you know, a street shooting guy that listens to his chain of command.
00:43:56.76 --> 00:43:59.60 Here's what happens.
00:43:59.60 --> 00:44:03.08 Colonel Bob Sink was a magnificent commander.
00:44:03.08 --> 00:44:08.08 But this time he had had a little too much to drink and is ordered to dispatch another
00:44:08.08 --> 00:44:13.48 patrol to capture additional prisoners did not make sense.
00:44:13.48 --> 00:44:16.92 We had already captured sufficient prisoners for interrogation.
00:44:16.92 --> 00:44:23.08 A second patrol would only result in casualties for no apparent reason.
00:44:23.08 --> 00:44:28.36 Either exacerbating the situation was freshly fallen snow along the river that had
00:44:28.36 --> 00:44:31.96 quickly turned to ice during the day.
00:44:31.96 --> 00:44:38.80 If I followed Colonel Sink's order, the enemy would have heard us coming a long way off.
00:44:38.80 --> 00:44:41.36 What to do?
00:44:41.36 --> 00:44:45.56 I responded, yes, sir.
00:44:45.56 --> 00:44:51.16 And then promptly ignored the order.
00:44:51.16 --> 00:44:56.68 So he's doing what I was basically, what I was saying.
00:44:56.68 --> 00:44:58.68 If he just said no sir, we're not going to do that.
00:44:58.68 --> 00:44:59.68 Guess what?
00:44:59.68 --> 00:45:03.28 He's going to get fired and now we're going to get someone else put in charge.
00:45:03.28 --> 00:45:06.76 And even if he doesn't get fired, he's hurting his reputation.
00:45:06.76 --> 00:45:09.08 So it's a bad situation.
00:45:09.08 --> 00:45:11.44 But what he decides to do is go, God, it's sir.
00:45:11.44 --> 00:45:12.92 We'll take care of it.
00:45:12.92 --> 00:45:16.84 And then he promptly ignores the order to now back to the book.
00:45:16.84 --> 00:45:21.68 To give the impression of compliance, however, I assembled the men in a building and told
00:45:21.68 --> 00:45:26.52 them we were not going to send out this patrol because I did not think it was feasible.
00:45:26.52 --> 00:45:32.44 I also informed them that my neck was in a news, if anyone ever said anything about it.
00:45:32.44 --> 00:45:35.60 With that, the men laid down and caught some much needed sleep.
00:45:35.60 --> 00:45:42.60 And I took the radio and adjusted mortar and artillery fire on my supposed objective.
00:45:42.60 --> 00:45:45.04 And here's his thoughts on it.
00:45:45.04 --> 00:45:51.04 On reflection, I did exactly the right thing and I have never had any regrets.
00:45:51.04 --> 00:45:53.80 There was insufficient time for preparation.
00:45:53.80 --> 00:46:00.04 The field to our front was wide open and I would have lost too many men for no purpose.
00:46:00.04 --> 00:46:04.88 I wonder what I would have done had I been a career officer concerned about my own
00:46:04.88 --> 00:46:07.04 future?
00:46:07.04 --> 00:46:10.56 Would I have compromised my beliefs?
00:46:10.56 --> 00:46:15.64 The deliberate disobedience of a lawful order by my commanding officer presented an ethical
00:46:15.64 --> 00:46:23.64 dilemma of the first magnitude.
00:46:23.64 --> 00:46:27.76 But you can see it's a guy who's staying on his principles.
00:46:27.76 --> 00:46:31.84 And his principles were to accomplish the mission, take care of his men and he's weighing
00:46:31.84 --> 00:46:32.84 those things out.
00:46:32.84 --> 00:46:35.000 Those things aren't black and white.
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.04 Those things are not black and white because you look at all the times he did do
00:46:40.04 --> 00:46:44.48 operations and missions and taskings where his guys got wounded and killed.
00:46:44.48 --> 00:46:45.76 But he saw what the purpose was.
00:46:45.76 --> 00:46:48.32 And now he sees something where there's no purpose and he says you know what?
00:46:48.32 --> 00:46:49.32 Not going to do it.
00:46:49.32 --> 00:46:50.84 But he doesn't tell the boss.
00:46:50.84 --> 00:46:53.56 He just does next to you.
00:46:53.56 --> 00:46:58.04 So there's stories of seals and Vietnam doing that.
00:46:58.04 --> 00:47:04.32 And I heard that from the Vietnam seals would tell me, hey, if they got directed to do something
00:47:04.32 --> 00:47:05.60 that they didn't think was a good mission.
00:47:05.60 --> 00:47:07.04 I've talked about this before.
00:47:07.04 --> 00:47:11.000 Oh, we're going to go. You want us to go three kilometers away and set up an ambush
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.76 on this river that's in really tough enemy control areas.
00:47:13.76 --> 00:47:16.76 And we don't know what the intelligence is on who's going to come down that river.
00:47:16.76 --> 00:47:18.24 Okay, cool.
00:47:18.24 --> 00:47:20.96 And they'd patrol 200 meters out the gate.
00:47:20.96 --> 00:47:26.04 Set up a little perimeter, right close to camp where there's no no problems, smoke a couple
00:47:26.04 --> 00:47:27.04 cigarettes.
00:47:27.04 --> 00:47:29.76 It's spent a few hours out there.
00:47:29.76 --> 00:47:30.76 Walk back.
00:47:30.76 --> 00:47:31.76 Yeah, hey, nothing happened.
00:47:31.76 --> 00:47:32.76 No one came down the river.
00:47:32.76 --> 00:47:35.76 I would think you'd have to be pretty responsible though.
00:47:35.76 --> 00:47:40.12 If you're going to kind of exercise that course of action, otherwise you get someone who's
00:47:40.12 --> 00:47:41.68 just like, no, don't feel like it.
00:47:41.68 --> 00:47:42.68 Don't feel like it.
00:47:42.68 --> 00:47:43.68 Yeah, no.
00:47:43.68 --> 00:47:46.24 It's obviously something that a guy like Dick Winner did very rarely.
00:47:46.24 --> 00:47:49.84 And the seals and Vietnam, something they were blown missions off all the time.
00:47:49.84 --> 00:47:56.44 But they, you know, like I said, if something comes up where you completely disagree with
00:47:56.44 --> 00:48:02.000 it, but you don't disagree with it to the point where you want to make a, you want to make
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.08 a stand that's going to make you get fired.
00:48:04.08 --> 00:48:06.36 Now you're not supporting your guys anymore.
00:48:06.36 --> 00:48:07.36 Yeah.
00:48:07.36 --> 00:48:08.36 Yeah.
00:48:08.36 --> 00:48:09.72 You know, okay, you kept them alive that night.
00:48:09.72 --> 00:48:12.08 Well, who's coming in to take your place?
00:48:12.08 --> 00:48:13.08 That's the question.
00:48:13.08 --> 00:48:14.08 Who's coming in to take your place?
00:48:14.08 --> 00:48:15.56 And you don't know who that is.
00:48:15.56 --> 00:48:18.52 And what's their best interest going to be?
00:48:18.52 --> 00:48:21.68 Because whoever comes in to take your place is going to be a company guy that's going to be
00:48:21.68 --> 00:48:27.40 he's going to be a guy that's going to obey every last direct order from the guy.
00:48:27.40 --> 00:48:28.96 And this is, you know, it's strange too.
00:48:28.96 --> 00:48:29.96 I mean, here I am.
00:48:29.96 --> 00:48:37.68 I mean, I was, as, as motivated it to be in the military as I could possibly be.
00:48:37.68 --> 00:48:42.36 You know, so I'm not sitting here calling from you, to from guys.
00:48:42.36 --> 00:48:44.52 But I am telling you to use common sense.
00:48:44.52 --> 00:48:47.28 And you've got to put common sense on top of everything.
00:48:47.28 --> 00:48:49.04 And sometimes common sense outweighs orders.
00:48:49.04 --> 00:48:50.60 That's just the way it is.
00:48:50.60 --> 00:48:51.60 It's rare.
00:48:51.60 --> 00:48:52.88 And I said this last time as well.
00:48:52.88 --> 00:48:53.88 It's rare.
00:48:53.88 --> 00:48:56.92 It's not like you're getting these crazy orders from up the chain of command.
00:48:56.92 --> 00:49:01.04 People aren't people aren't advancing in the military because they're idiots.
00:49:01.04 --> 00:49:02.04 Right.
00:49:02.04 --> 00:49:03.04 Yeah.
00:49:03.04 --> 00:49:04.04 And it's not like they're not on your team.
00:49:04.04 --> 00:49:06.48 And it's not like they want you to get killed.
00:49:06.48 --> 00:49:10.56 And you know, maybe, you know, in this case, he could have given some pushback and said,
00:49:10.56 --> 00:49:12.44 hey, you know what, boss here's what's going on.
00:49:12.44 --> 00:49:13.44 There's fresh snow.
00:49:13.44 --> 00:49:14.84 It's good they're going to hear us coming in a mile away.
00:49:14.84 --> 00:49:16.92 We don't have good cover to the front.
00:49:16.92 --> 00:49:19.72 This is not a good operation.
00:49:19.72 --> 00:49:25.28 But maybe he heard the tone of the Colonel's voice and just said, hey, if I say that, and
00:49:25.28 --> 00:49:28.64 then I don't do it, or if I say that, it's going to make me suspicious.
00:49:28.64 --> 00:49:30.44 So you know what, I got it, sir.
00:49:30.44 --> 00:49:32.000 And then don't do it.
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.40 Just a judge, a judgment of character.
00:49:36.40 --> 00:49:39.16 But that's what you've got writing on you and your in a leadership position.
00:49:39.16 --> 00:49:41.72 You got those guys' lives.
00:49:41.72 --> 00:49:44.68 And that should be more important than anything.
00:49:44.68 --> 00:49:52.56 And it's a strange dichotomy of leadership because on the one hand, you're trained
00:49:52.56 --> 00:49:59.48 your whole military career that you got to take care of your men, take care of your people.
00:49:59.48 --> 00:50:04.80 That's something you get trained on since day one, take care of your team.
00:50:04.80 --> 00:50:08.28 And the dichotomy of that is you're going to do missions where you could very well
00:50:08.28 --> 00:50:09.92 be sending your men to their death.
00:50:09.92 --> 00:50:12.96 So there's a massive dichotomy there.
00:50:12.96 --> 00:50:14.28 And how do you deal with the dichotomy?
00:50:14.28 --> 00:50:16.48 You find the balance.
00:50:16.48 --> 00:50:21.48 And the balance is not a cookie cutter response.
00:50:21.48 --> 00:50:25.32 The balance is different for each scenario that you're in.
00:50:25.32 --> 00:50:33.96 And how well you can weigh those opposing forces is a measure of what kind of leader you
00:50:33.96 --> 00:50:36.48 are.
00:50:36.48 --> 00:50:40.60 That's what makes leadership hard.
00:50:40.60 --> 00:50:57.16 Now we're getting to move through Europe and now we're about to go from war to something
00:50:57.16 --> 00:51:04.40 even more evil, which is the concentration camps, the death camps.
00:51:04.40 --> 00:51:07.36 So back to the book.
00:51:07.36 --> 00:51:11.88 Because they enter, this is back to the book, as they enter the death camps for the first
00:51:11.88 --> 00:51:14.32 time.
00:51:14.32 --> 00:51:20.72 The horror of what we observe remains with each paratrooper to this day.
00:51:20.72 --> 00:51:22.64 You could not explain it.
00:51:22.64 --> 00:51:24.64 You could not describe it.
00:51:24.64 --> 00:51:27.68 And you could not exaggerate it.
00:51:27.68 --> 00:51:33.56 It did not take long to realize that the Nazis were intent on eliminating all the Jews,
00:51:33.56 --> 00:51:39.000 the Nazis, and anyone who disagreed with Hitler's regime.
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.28 The memory of starved, dazed men who dropped their eyes and heads and looked at them through
00:51:44.28 --> 00:51:49.80 the chain-link fence in the same manner that a beaten mystery to dog would cringe.
00:51:49.80 --> 00:51:54.52 Left a mark on all of us forever.
00:51:54.52 --> 00:52:01.28 Nor could you underestimate the barbarity of the Nazi regime, even during the latter stages
00:52:01.28 --> 00:52:05.76 of the war.
00:52:05.76 --> 00:52:13.24 As I went through the war, it was natural to ask myself, why am I here?
00:52:13.24 --> 00:52:19.60 Why am I putting up with a freezing cold, the constant rain, and the loss of so many comrades?
00:52:19.60 --> 00:52:22.08 Does anybody care?
00:52:22.08 --> 00:52:30.08 A soldier faces death on a daily basis, and his life is one of misery and deprivation.
00:52:30.08 --> 00:52:36.92 He is cold, he suffers from hunger frequently bordering on starvation.
00:52:36.92 --> 00:52:44.56 The impact of seeing those people behind that fence left me saying, if only to myself,
00:52:44.56 --> 00:52:47.84 now I know why I am here.
00:52:47.84 --> 00:52:55.84 For the first time, I understand what this war is all about.
00:52:55.84 --> 00:53:02.68 And obviously seeing that evil firsthand.
00:53:02.68 --> 00:53:10.12 That's one of the reasons why I think we explore the darkness and the evil on a fairly regular
00:53:10.12 --> 00:53:12.96 basis here.
00:53:12.96 --> 00:53:14.44 That's why I explore it.
00:53:14.44 --> 00:53:19.48 That's why my mind is drawn to these things because you've got to understand that
00:53:19.48 --> 00:53:30.92 evil is out there, and it's still here today, and somebody has got to take the fight
00:53:30.92 --> 00:53:37.20 to the enemy.
00:53:37.20 --> 00:53:44.92 Now I'm jumping towards the end of the book, and again, it's not really not given anything
00:53:44.92 --> 00:53:45.92 away.
00:53:45.92 --> 00:53:54.48 It's not allowed World War II ended, but this is how winter, or sorry, major winter is
00:53:54.48 --> 00:54:02.60 kind of wraps up their combat back to the book.
00:54:02.60 --> 00:54:09.84 And so many of the co-avadrins returned home, yet all would be forever connected by their
00:54:09.84 --> 00:54:13.52 shared experiences in combat.
00:54:13.52 --> 00:54:20.52 The course of the war, easy company alone, lost 48 men killed, and over 100 wounded,
00:54:20.52 --> 00:54:25.12 incurring 150% casualties.
00:54:25.12 --> 00:54:30.76 This percentage was not uncommon among similar units who had fought in the campaign of Northwest
00:54:30.76 --> 00:54:33.36 Europe.
00:54:33.36 --> 00:54:39.56 At the peak of its effectiveness in Holland in October of 1944, and in the R-Dens in January
00:54:39.56 --> 00:54:47.32 1945, it was as good a rifle company as there was in the world, according to Arthur Steven
00:54:47.32 --> 00:54:49.48 E. Ambrose.
00:54:49.48 --> 00:54:56.08 How so many men survived the campaigns in Normandy, Holland, Bastone, and Germany was a true
00:54:56.08 --> 00:55:05.08 testament to their courage, their training, and their discipline under fire.
00:55:05.08 --> 00:55:12.40 And now I want to fast forward a little bit more to...
00:55:12.40 --> 00:55:14.68 He's done.
00:55:14.68 --> 00:55:18.44 He's now out of the military, and I know we got a lot of people that listened to the
00:55:18.44 --> 00:55:23.32 show, because a lot of you guys reached out to me, and talk about that transition, a lot
00:55:23.32 --> 00:55:32.96 of people asked me about that transition, and here's Dick Winter's transition.
00:55:32.96 --> 00:55:38.80 While I was extremely happy to put the army behind me, I realized that I was a different
00:55:38.80 --> 00:55:44.24 man than I was when I joined the army over four years earlier.
00:55:44.24 --> 00:55:51.72 The war had changed me in many ways, as it does all who experience combat.
00:55:51.72 --> 00:55:57.80 Having witnessed so much mass suffering, and the unparalleled barbarism that mankind is
00:55:57.80 --> 00:56:01.76 capable of inflicting upon itself.
00:56:01.76 --> 00:56:09.80 I don't see how any survivor can be ever be cruel to anything again.
00:56:09.80 --> 00:56:16.48 In addition, I was a far better judge of character than I had been in 1941.
00:56:16.48 --> 00:56:21.24 That feeling remains with me today a full 60 years after the war.
00:56:21.24 --> 00:56:25.08 When I meet people for the first time and get to know them, I can't help but judge them
00:56:25.08 --> 00:56:27.08 and size them up.
00:56:27.08 --> 00:56:28.72 Do they have leadership?
00:56:28.72 --> 00:56:31.72 Would they be good in combat?
00:56:31.72 --> 00:56:36.000 Do they pass the test?
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:43.48 I was also more disciplined than I remembered being before I deployed to Europe.
00:56:43.48 --> 00:56:49.40 This discipline helped me adapt to civilian life once I returned to Pennsylvania.
00:56:49.40 --> 00:56:54.12 Like all veterans, I had to adjust to society, the life that you were going to share
00:56:54.12 --> 00:56:57.56 with others in order to make a living.
00:56:57.56 --> 00:57:03.36 I certainly never confused the challenges in the workplace with what I experienced in combat.
00:57:03.36 --> 00:57:07.64 There would be no life and death struggles in the corporate world.
00:57:07.64 --> 00:57:10.92 Business hardly equates to war.
00:57:10.92 --> 00:57:15.44 Such comparisons demean the word.
00:57:15.44 --> 00:57:20.40 When I read that, I actually had to put myself into check.
00:57:20.40 --> 00:57:24.000 I wanted to make sure that I'm clear about something.
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:33.32 And obviously we wrote a book that's about comparing business and war.
00:57:33.32 --> 00:57:38.08 But I want to make it clear that what we're comparing and what we say is similar.
00:57:38.08 --> 00:57:45.64 In fact, they're the same is that principles, the principles of leadership are the same.
00:57:45.64 --> 00:57:49.88 The struggles and the challenges and the consequences are not the same.
00:57:49.88 --> 00:57:53.48 They are not.
00:57:53.48 --> 00:57:59.48 So I want to make sure I make that clear.
00:57:59.48 --> 00:58:10.48 Now, what's get to some of his reflections on leadership?
00:58:10.48 --> 00:58:11.96 Back to the book.
00:58:11.96 --> 00:58:14.72 Was I a successful leader?
00:58:14.72 --> 00:58:19.48 They tell me I was and modesty prevents me from disagreeing with them.
00:58:19.48 --> 00:58:24.48 I am not so naive that I don't realize the wide appeal of dick winners today as based
00:58:24.48 --> 00:58:27.40 on leadership in combat.
00:58:27.40 --> 00:58:33.24 I may not have been the best commander, but I always strove to be.
00:58:33.24 --> 00:58:38.88 My men depended on me to carefully analyze every tactical situation to maximize the resources
00:58:38.88 --> 00:58:45.68 that I had at my disposal to think under pressure and delete them by personal example.
00:58:45.68 --> 00:58:50.68 I think it's interesting, even here, you know, he's looking back and he's a humble guy.
00:58:50.68 --> 00:58:56.24 You know, I may have not been the best combat commander, but I always tried to be.
00:58:56.24 --> 00:58:58.72 This is a humble man.
00:58:58.72 --> 00:59:03.60 I am not sure there is such a thing as a natural born leader.
00:59:03.60 --> 00:59:07.52 Some leaders are born with special aptitudes or talents.
00:59:07.52 --> 00:59:13.000 But any success I might have had was the product of good upbringing, intense study and
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:19.000 preparation and physical conditioning that set me apart from my peers.
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000 Here's dick winners.
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:27.96 I mean, one of the best kind of combat leaders at the tactical level in the modern era.
00:59:27.96 --> 00:59:32.20 And he's saying that it was preparation and physical conditioning, setting him apart from
00:59:32.20 --> 00:59:33.92 his peers.
00:59:33.92 --> 00:59:35.16 I was all back the book.
00:59:35.16 --> 00:59:39.80 I was also surrounded by a group of men who were disciplined and highly trained to accomplish
00:59:39.80 --> 00:59:41.96 any mission.
00:59:41.96 --> 00:59:45.76 I'd love to the equation and you can understand that the secret to my success was that
00:59:45.76 --> 00:59:50.60 somehow I always managed to survive another day.
00:59:50.60 --> 00:59:55.80 In recent years, I've been asked to address an increasing number of civic groups, corporate
00:59:55.80 --> 01:00:02.48 seminars, and governmental agencies on the subject of leadership.
01:00:02.48 --> 01:00:10.40 Most are looking for cookie cutter solutions as to what constitutes a successful leader.
01:00:10.40 --> 01:00:12.64 What is the recipe for success?
01:00:12.64 --> 01:00:14.88 And this is classic.
01:00:14.88 --> 01:00:25.08 And actually when the book came out, we did a bunch of interviews that got turned into either
01:00:25.08 --> 01:00:28.08 short articles or video clips.
01:00:28.08 --> 01:00:30.12 And they title these things.
01:00:30.12 --> 01:00:32.68 Like three things every leader must do.
01:00:32.68 --> 01:00:34.16 And that's what they always do.
01:00:34.16 --> 01:00:36.68 Everyone's looking exactly for what he says.
01:00:36.68 --> 01:00:42.20 They start looking for cookie cutter solutions to what constitutes a successful leader.
01:00:42.20 --> 01:00:45.20 What is the recipe for success?
01:00:45.20 --> 01:00:49.08 In truth, there are no simple solutions.
01:00:49.08 --> 01:00:53.000 Just as there is no average day in combat.
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.76 Each situation is different.
01:00:54.76 --> 01:01:00.12 And each requires a leader to be flexible in adapting his or her particular leadership style
01:01:00.12 --> 01:01:05.48 to the specific circumstances required to accomplish any mission.
01:01:05.48 --> 01:01:10.52 It's a matter of adjusting to the individual and you do this every day.
01:01:10.52 --> 01:01:13.48 You don't have just one way of treating people.
01:01:13.48 --> 01:01:20.76 You adjust yourself to whom you are talking.
01:01:20.76 --> 01:01:25.52 If I would give advice to a young leader going to war based on my observation of what
01:01:25.52 --> 01:01:30.80 I had constituted the success of the outstanding leaders who comprised the American parachute
01:01:30.80 --> 01:01:35.28 infantry regiment of World War II, I would offer a series of principles that I am
01:01:35.28 --> 01:01:40.40 certain would result in great success regardless of the field endeavor, field of endeavor
01:01:40.40 --> 01:01:42.40 in which the individual was participating.
01:01:42.40 --> 01:01:46.76 So here he's saying the same thing that I said, which is leadership is the same, whether
01:01:46.76 --> 01:01:50.80 it's in the battlefield or whatever endeavor you're going into, leadership principles
01:01:50.80 --> 01:01:53.44 stay the same.
01:01:53.44 --> 01:02:00.68 First and foremost, a leader should strive to be an individual of flawless character,
01:02:00.68 --> 01:02:05.48 physical competence and moral courage.
01:02:05.48 --> 01:02:09.92 If you have character, that means you are the guy, that means the guy you are dealing
01:02:09.92 --> 01:02:13.28 with can trust you.
01:02:13.28 --> 01:02:19.40 The men trust you have faith in you and they obey you no questions asked.
01:02:19.40 --> 01:02:22.04 That's character in a nutshell.
01:02:22.04 --> 01:02:26.88 Character also allows you to make decisions quickly and correctly.
01:02:26.88 --> 01:02:31.52 One may question my decision to disobey a direct order from my commanding officer.
01:02:31.52 --> 01:02:34.72 This is the story we already talked about.
01:02:34.72 --> 01:02:41.12 And to fake another patrol as a violation of that very principle I'm advocating.
01:02:41.12 --> 01:02:46.40 In my heart, however, I could not send my men to risk their lives for no apparent reason
01:02:46.40 --> 01:02:51.24 when clearly nothing would have been gained that we had not already achieved.
01:02:51.24 --> 01:02:57.24 Such a course takes a degree of moral courage, which I have found is far rather than physical
01:02:57.24 --> 01:02:58.48 courage.
01:02:58.48 --> 01:03:00.08 Was I correct?
01:03:00.08 --> 01:03:06.76 In my estimation, I fought so and I have never regretted my decision.
01:03:06.76 --> 01:03:10.56 The same holds true for developing leaders of competency.
01:03:10.56 --> 01:03:15.72 Those entrusted to lead must study their profession to become totally proficient in tactics
01:03:15.72 --> 01:03:17.92 and technology.
01:03:17.92 --> 01:03:22.60 Prior to the invasion, I read every tactical manual I could lay my hands on to improve
01:03:22.60 --> 01:03:27.12 my tactical knowledge and professional competence while other soldiers were out curousing
01:03:27.12 --> 01:03:29.28 in the pubs.
01:03:29.28 --> 01:03:33.44 While they were enjoying the social life of the neighboring towns, I was reading and educating
01:03:33.44 --> 01:03:41.64 myself, getting ready to lead men into combat.
01:03:41.64 --> 01:03:43.64 Getting smarter.
01:03:43.64 --> 01:03:44.64 Open it up the books.
01:03:44.64 --> 01:03:46.88 That's what he was doing.
01:03:46.88 --> 01:03:47.88 And that's part of leadership.
01:03:47.88 --> 01:03:55.36 That's part of his characteristics of leadership is to become knowledgeable to read and
01:03:55.36 --> 01:03:59.60 study.
01:03:59.60 --> 01:04:00.60 He goes on.
01:04:00.60 --> 01:04:03.96 Don't waste time attempting to define leadership.
01:04:03.96 --> 01:04:06.20 No need to go to a dictionary.
01:04:06.20 --> 01:04:11.32 The infantry school at Fort Benning, Georgia has defined leadership in just two words via
01:04:11.32 --> 01:04:19.60 its motto, follow me.
01:04:19.60 --> 01:04:24.92 And he's going to do it again right here.
01:04:24.92 --> 01:04:28.32 Physical fitness is another prerequisite for success.
01:04:28.32 --> 01:04:32.64 I freely admit that I was blessed with a sound physical constitution but whenever possible
01:04:32.64 --> 01:04:37.12 I took the opportunity to improve my physical stamina.
01:04:37.12 --> 01:04:41.52 As I was in such good physical shape, I easily survived to coa.
01:04:41.52 --> 01:04:44.96 That's their initial training that they went through for airborne.
01:04:44.96 --> 01:04:49.32 While men washed out on a daily basis, the contingent from easy company that completed
01:04:49.32 --> 01:04:54.000 the training and earned their wings at Fort Benning were tough as nails.
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.24 Because I was in such good shape, my fatigue level never reached the point of physical
01:04:59.24 --> 01:05:04.68 exhaustion that contributes to mental exhaustion and ultimately to combat fatigue.
01:05:04.68 --> 01:05:08.64 We all experience sleep deprivation at times.
01:05:08.64 --> 01:05:10.60 That is the nature of stress.
01:05:10.60 --> 01:05:20.04 But a physically exhausted leader routinely makes poor decisions in times of crisis.
01:05:20.04 --> 01:05:26.40 And here he talks about another piece.
01:05:26.40 --> 01:05:31.56 I have always felt that my principal contribution to the success of both easy company and
01:05:31.56 --> 01:05:39.84 second battalion was based on my knowledge of what to expect from each man.
01:05:39.84 --> 01:05:43.16 Know your people.
01:05:43.16 --> 01:05:48.64 Having selected the right men for the right job, I then delegated the authority to my
01:05:48.64 --> 01:05:55.000 subordinates and allowed them to use their initiative to execute the mission.
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.52 Decentralized command.
01:05:57.52 --> 01:06:03.44 There is no need to tell someone how to do his job if you have properly trained your
01:06:03.44 --> 01:06:09.04 team.
01:06:09.04 --> 01:06:13.60 Good preparation is always vital to the success of any operation.
01:06:13.60 --> 01:06:19.28 But leaders must remain flexible once the action commences.
01:06:19.28 --> 01:06:24.48 Steve Ambrose likes to quote general Eisenhower who claimed before the battle is joined,
01:06:24.48 --> 01:06:26.72 plans or everything.
01:06:26.72 --> 01:06:36.000 Once the battle is joined, however plans go out the window.
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.32 Next I would encourage leaders to take a moment of self reflection before rushing into
01:06:41.32 --> 01:06:44.32 important decisions.
01:06:44.32 --> 01:06:47.92 This is a little bit of detachment.
01:06:47.92 --> 01:06:51.96 Many leaders don't take the time to consider carefully their decisions or the implications
01:06:51.96 --> 01:06:54.32 of their actions.
01:06:54.32 --> 01:07:02.76 In battle, I periodically detached myself mentally from the noises and the chaos of battle.
01:07:02.76 --> 01:07:08.32 I found it useful to separate myself momentarily and to carefully think through what actions
01:07:08.32 --> 01:07:11.92 I needed to take to accomplish the mission.
01:07:11.92 --> 01:07:16.88 Again, I read this book for the first time last week.
01:07:16.88 --> 01:07:18.64 He's saying detachment straight up.
01:07:18.64 --> 01:07:23.84 He's saying the exact same in battle, I periodically detached myself mentally from the noises
01:07:23.84 --> 01:07:27.12 and chaos of battle.
01:07:27.12 --> 01:07:29.28 Hang tough.
01:07:29.28 --> 01:07:34.12 Never, ever give up regardless of the adversity.
01:07:34.12 --> 01:07:42.84 If you are a leader, a fellow who other fellows look to, you have got to keep going.
01:07:42.84 --> 01:07:49.36 I would also urge leaders to remain humble.
01:07:49.36 --> 01:07:55.24 If you don't worry about who gets the credit, you get a lot more done.
01:07:55.24 --> 01:07:58.76 Again, this is when people ask me what's the most important quality of a leader.
01:07:58.76 --> 01:08:01.40 I tell them that humility.
01:08:01.40 --> 01:08:08.16 Leaders should assume the blame when the operation fails.
01:08:08.16 --> 01:08:12.68 When it succeeds, credit the men and women in your team.
01:08:12.68 --> 01:08:16.04 They do the lion's share of the work.
01:08:16.04 --> 01:08:19.92 And now he's going to talk about humility a little bit more.
01:08:19.92 --> 01:08:25.88 Since the release of the HBO miniseries, many of us have been flooded with hundreds, sometimes
01:08:25.88 --> 01:08:31.64 thousands of letters from adoring fans across the nation.
01:08:31.64 --> 01:08:37.64 The attention is certainly flattering and greatly appreciated.
01:08:37.64 --> 01:08:44.44 But it remains better to remember Eisenhower's address at Guild Hall Hall on June 12,
01:08:44.44 --> 01:08:53.40 1945, to an ecstatic British public, which showered the Supreme Commander with a tumultuous
01:08:53.40 --> 01:08:56.48 parade through the streets of London.
01:08:56.48 --> 01:09:01.84 I commanded them.
01:09:01.84 --> 01:09:09.56 Humility must always be the portion of any man who receives a claim earned in the blood of
01:09:09.56 --> 01:09:17.40 his followers and the sacrifices of his friends.
01:09:17.40 --> 01:09:25.000 I think anybody that's ever been in a leadership position and has been called some kind
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.32 of hero will think back to that statement.
01:09:29.32 --> 01:09:35.000 Humility must always be the portion of any man who receives a claim earned in the blood
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:44.52 of his followers and the sacrifices of his friends.
01:09:44.52 --> 01:09:53.76 And I think when you use that word hero, it's something that obviously gets thrown
01:09:53.76 --> 01:09:59.000 around a lot.
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:07.40 And here's what Major Winners had to say about that, perhaps the best characterization
01:10:07.40 --> 01:10:16.28 of what a true hero consists is found in a letter, Sergeant Mike Rainy sent me in January
01:10:16.28 --> 01:10:22.08 1982, surely before he went back to the hospital for a series of tests.
01:10:22.08 --> 01:10:26.76 Historians Stephen Ambrose used the passage to conclude band of brothers because Rainy
01:10:26.76 --> 01:10:33.56 encapsulated the cohesion that became the hallmark of easy company.
01:10:33.56 --> 01:10:40.000 In thinking back on the days of easy company, I'm treasuring my remark to a grandson who
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:47.44 asked grandpa, were you a hero in the war?
01:10:47.44 --> 01:10:54.08 No, I answered, but I served in a company of heroes.
01:10:54.08 --> 01:11:02.56 And I can tell you that I also served with many, many heroes, the guys in tasking to bruiser
01:11:02.56 --> 01:11:07.44 the guys from 2 to 8 infantry, the guys from 1-1-AD and the ready first, the soldiers and
01:11:07.44 --> 01:11:19.64 the Marines, all those brave men.
01:11:19.64 --> 01:11:26.44 And some brave women as well.
01:11:26.44 --> 01:11:32.12 And to those men and women, those soldiers and Marines that I was lucky enough to serve
01:11:32.12 --> 01:11:42.12 with, I think that this statement right here from Dick Winners is something that I think
01:11:42.12 --> 01:11:46.52 is very fitting.
01:11:46.52 --> 01:11:52.72 As I look back on the men of easy company and the closeness we have enjoyed over the years,
01:11:52.72 --> 01:11:58.16 I reminded of the dialogue attributed to a senior German officer bidding farewell to his men
01:11:58.16 --> 01:12:02.20 in the HBO miniseries.
01:12:02.20 --> 01:12:09.08 Paraphrasing his words, I would say to easy company and the officers in men of the 506
01:12:09.08 --> 01:12:12.84 parachute infantry regiment.
01:12:12.84 --> 01:12:16.28 It has been a long war.
01:12:16.28 --> 01:12:21.28 It's been a hard war.
01:12:21.28 --> 01:12:26.000 You have fought bravely, proudly for your country.
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:33.04 You are a special group of men connected by a bond that only exists in combat.
01:12:33.04 --> 01:12:39.52 You've shared the in-communicable experience of war and have been tested under extreme
01:12:39.52 --> 01:12:41.80 adversity.
01:12:41.80 --> 01:12:47.56 You've shared foxholes and have held each other in dire moments.
01:12:47.56 --> 01:12:51.96 You've seen death and have suffered together.
01:12:51.96 --> 01:13:00.16 You've lived in an environment totally incomprehensible to those who do not know war.
01:13:00.16 --> 01:13:06.64 I am proud and deeply honored to have served with every one of you.
01:13:06.64 --> 01:13:12.56 You all deserve long and happy lives in peace.
01:13:12.56 --> 01:13:18.52 I bid each of you God's speed and ask the Almighty to shower his blessings on you and your
01:13:18.52 --> 01:13:24.96 families now and for generations to come.
01:13:24.96 --> 01:13:34.96 And that wraps the book and, you know, I was thinking after the last podcast that this
01:13:34.96 --> 01:13:39.52 was going to be a lighter one.
01:13:39.52 --> 01:13:47.12 And I picked this book specifically because I see major dick winners as an incredible person,
01:13:47.12 --> 01:13:53.68 incredible leader, a role model for everyone.
01:13:53.68 --> 01:14:04.92 But because we are talking about war, there is still tragedy and loss and darkness there.
01:14:04.92 --> 01:14:12.84 And that's okay.
01:14:12.84 --> 01:14:22.20 And do you vet out there like the anonymous Marine that wrote that tribute to his brothers
01:14:22.20 --> 01:14:26.44 from April 2nd?
01:14:26.44 --> 01:14:31.48 And we know there's hundreds of thousands of veterans that are feeling that every day.
01:14:31.48 --> 01:14:42.88 If you're having one of those dark days, it's okay.
01:14:42.88 --> 01:14:49.80 It's okay.
01:14:49.80 --> 01:14:56.36 It's okay to feel that darkness.
01:14:56.36 --> 01:15:04.64 It's okay to remember it and miss it and hate it and love it.
01:15:04.64 --> 01:15:08.92 And it's okay to wish it never happened.
01:15:08.92 --> 01:15:15.60 And at the same time, to wish it never stopped.
01:15:15.60 --> 01:15:21.40 And it's okay to want to take it all back.
01:15:21.40 --> 01:15:31.52 And at the same time, to want to do it all again.
01:15:31.52 --> 01:15:43.48 And if you've got in your mind that you think that people don't understand, that's okay.
01:15:43.48 --> 01:15:46.92 They don't.
01:15:46.92 --> 01:15:50.64 But you do.
01:15:50.64 --> 01:15:57.08 You know darkness, you know evil.
01:15:57.08 --> 01:16:01.76 But more important than that.
01:16:01.76 --> 01:16:06.20 You know good.
01:16:06.20 --> 01:16:10.72 You know light.
01:16:10.72 --> 01:16:20.72 You know laughter and love better than anyone.
01:16:20.72 --> 01:16:29.48 So embrace.
01:16:29.48 --> 01:16:31.76 Embrace that darkness.
01:16:31.76 --> 01:16:32.76 Own it.
01:16:32.76 --> 01:16:34.40 Don't look away from it.
01:16:34.40 --> 01:16:39.16 Don't bury it in booze or in pills.
01:16:39.16 --> 01:16:42.16 Listen.
01:16:42.16 --> 01:16:49.72 Listen to what corporal Scott Procopio would have been saying to you, live your life.
01:16:49.72 --> 01:16:59.68 Embrace your life with physical activity and with nature and with you jutsu and with
01:16:59.68 --> 01:17:10.84 son and with laughter and guitar and good memories and creativity and discipline.
01:17:10.84 --> 01:17:15.68 Discipline yourself.
01:17:15.68 --> 01:17:29.64 So you can free yourself and move forward into the future.
01:17:29.64 --> 01:17:34.88 Whether there's no more darkness and no more war.
01:17:34.88 --> 01:17:40.20 But peace.
01:17:40.20 --> 01:17:42.52 Good evening, Echo.
01:17:42.52 --> 01:17:47.24 Good evening.
01:17:47.24 --> 01:17:49.40 Little message to the vets out there.
01:17:49.40 --> 01:17:56.64 I hear from a lot of veterans and I just want to let those guys know, you know, kind of
01:17:56.64 --> 01:18:03.64 where I'm coming from, get a lot of real positive stuff from guys and let some guys go
01:18:03.64 --> 01:18:13.76 with you hard times and I know it and you know, I'm hoping to be able to kind of spread
01:18:13.76 --> 01:18:23.68 my thoughts where I'm at and how what I think of these things.
01:18:23.68 --> 01:18:32.24 Because you know, if you get guys like major winners that you know did everything that
01:18:32.24 --> 01:18:38.20 he did in war, he came back and you know, he was able to figure it out and a lot of
01:18:38.20 --> 01:18:42.48 those veterans were and they, you know, he said, wasn't an easy adaptation that they
01:18:42.48 --> 01:18:46.56 made but they made it.
01:18:46.56 --> 01:18:49.80 They made it.
01:18:49.80 --> 01:19:00.32 So I think you got to embrace those things and be stronger than them.
01:19:00.32 --> 01:19:03.64 And I know and I said all the time, you got to know that darkness and you really want
01:19:03.64 --> 01:19:11.08 to appreciate the light and I think that guys that have been to war, they can do that
01:19:11.08 --> 01:19:17.44 and life can seem so much better.
01:19:17.44 --> 01:19:23.92 You know how bad it can be.
01:19:23.92 --> 01:19:38.32 So speaking of feedback from people, rough transition right now, but that's what we do here.
01:19:38.32 --> 01:19:41.000 What rough transition?
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000 Rough transitions.
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000 And you know what?
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.56 You know what's interesting about the rough transitions?
01:19:44.56 --> 01:19:47.76 And any movement that's out there that's listening to me right now or anybody that's not
01:19:47.76 --> 01:19:53.80 a vet that anyone that's been through hard times and loss, it's a big rough transition
01:19:53.80 --> 01:19:56.68 and you go in and out emotionally.
01:19:56.68 --> 01:20:00.36 And you know, you'll be feeling like crap one minute and then the next minute you'll feel
01:20:00.36 --> 01:20:04.64 okay and you'll be laughing and that's, that's like I said, that's okay.
01:20:04.64 --> 01:20:12.08 I think a lot of people are scared that they might be acting the wrong way.
01:20:12.08 --> 01:20:15.08 But it's all right.
01:20:15.08 --> 01:20:16.08 It's okay.
01:20:16.08 --> 01:20:20.84 Yeah, and just like how you're saying where it may seem like people don't understand
01:20:20.84 --> 01:20:26.20 and that's okay because they don't, that's so true because in this way, I think of it
01:20:26.20 --> 01:20:32.60 because my best friends are actually they're still in, maybe seals.
01:20:32.60 --> 01:20:34.56 So these are guys that you grow up with.
01:20:34.56 --> 01:20:39.44 Grow up with and spend your best friends there in my wedding.
01:20:39.44 --> 01:20:42.40 So a lot of them do you don't want to talk to them and stuff?
01:20:42.40 --> 01:20:47.48 I just in my own head I kind of imagine what it's like coming back.
01:20:47.48 --> 01:20:51.16 So if you kind of consider it kind of in a nutshell where you consider, hey, what's your
01:20:51.16 --> 01:20:54.68 biggest problems when you're overseas, when you're in the war?
01:20:54.68 --> 01:20:56.88 What are these big problems you gotta worry about?
01:20:56.88 --> 01:21:02.000 Okay, and then let's factor that in okay, then we come home and then look okay, let's
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.24 say in the where your biggest problem is getting shot and die.
01:21:05.24 --> 01:21:12.24 Are you getting both your legs blown off or whatever?
01:21:12.24 --> 01:21:16.20 Whatever your biggest problem is as far as worrying about.
01:21:16.20 --> 01:21:20.76 Okay, then you come home and on and on your girlfriend or your wife is like, hey, I thought
01:21:20.76 --> 01:21:24.56 I told you to do those dishes and she's flipping out on you.
01:21:24.56 --> 01:21:29.32 So in the back of your mind, you're kind of like okay, wait, the comparison, it was two days
01:21:29.32 --> 01:21:30.32 ago.
01:21:30.32 --> 01:21:32.24 I was in the desert worried about my legs being blown off.
01:21:32.24 --> 01:21:37.32 And now I'm here, we're apparently the biggest problem according to my girlfriend's
01:21:37.32 --> 01:21:38.32 life.
01:21:38.32 --> 01:21:39.68 The biggest problem on earth.
01:21:39.68 --> 01:21:42.72 Apparently because she's the only one she's really met, she's met.
01:21:42.72 --> 01:21:45.44 She won't really talk to me or the dishes, yeah.
01:21:45.44 --> 01:21:47.56 And it's just not computing, you know?
01:21:47.56 --> 01:21:51.84 And then you go next door and their biggest problem is kind on the same level.
01:21:51.84 --> 01:21:53.48 So yeah, they don't understand.
01:21:53.48 --> 01:21:59.12 And you in a way you're living in this crazy world where I can see how that could kind
01:21:59.12 --> 01:22:02.92 of get to you and be like, man, am I wrong?
01:22:02.92 --> 01:22:07.40 Yeah, so one of the things that I and you hear me talk about this before is perspective.
01:22:07.40 --> 01:22:10.56 And wanting to see, I always talk about it from a leadership perspective like I want to
01:22:10.56 --> 01:22:13.80 think about what my superior is thinking.
01:22:13.80 --> 01:22:14.80 Why is he telling me to do this?
01:22:14.80 --> 01:22:16.04 Let me get his perspective.
01:22:16.04 --> 01:22:19.52 And then what are my, what are my subordinates thinking?
01:22:19.52 --> 01:22:21.44 What is their perspective?
01:22:21.44 --> 01:22:25.20 And it's a very useful tool to use and what you're talking about right now.
01:22:25.20 --> 01:22:29.08 And I remember I had a situation like that where I would be like, I'm not going to
01:22:29.08 --> 01:22:30.08 always at work.
01:22:30.08 --> 01:22:33.12 And I forget what was going on, but something was going on.
01:22:33.12 --> 01:22:36.32 Like I think we were preparing to deploy guys earlier.
01:22:36.32 --> 01:22:38.44 There's something major was going on.
01:22:38.44 --> 01:22:40.12 There was major issues.
01:22:40.12 --> 01:22:42.48 I think it was Afghanistan.
01:22:42.48 --> 01:22:44.08 And we were getting ready to deploy guys early.
01:22:44.08 --> 01:22:46.88 It was a real big spin up and all this stuff.
01:22:46.88 --> 01:22:53.44 And literally I come home and I mean, I'm at work and we're trying to figure out I
01:22:53.44 --> 01:22:58.28 were put this plan together and guys are going to play and it's horrible and you know,
01:22:58.28 --> 01:22:59.04 whatever.
01:22:59.04 --> 01:23:00.04 I'm just stressed.
01:23:00.04 --> 01:23:03.48 I come home and I, hey, babe, you know how you doing?
01:23:03.48 --> 01:23:07.88 I said in my wife and she's sitting there and all of a sudden she like picks up the
01:23:07.88 --> 01:23:11.56 phone and someone calls her or she, someone calls her, she picks up the phone and she
01:23:11.56 --> 01:23:12.56 hangs up.
01:23:12.56 --> 01:23:13.80 She's like, I can't believe this.
01:23:13.80 --> 01:23:17.16 Yeah, and I'm like, I thought something, you know, I thought someone died or
01:23:17.16 --> 01:23:18.16 whatever.
01:23:18.16 --> 01:23:20.72 And I said, I said, oh, what's wrong?
01:23:20.72 --> 01:23:21.72 What's wrong?
01:23:21.72 --> 01:23:26.60 And she said, um, there was something along like the wiggles is the same night as
01:23:26.60 --> 01:23:28.52 Barney and I booked both tickets.
01:23:28.52 --> 01:23:33.44 So with some things she was taking the kids to that like the literally did not matter
01:23:33.44 --> 01:23:35.80 in any way shape or formed a me at all.
01:23:35.80 --> 01:23:40.68 But it's her, you know, she had spent $22 on these tickets for three kids at the time.
01:23:40.68 --> 01:23:46.52 At $66 and now she had booked double booked the children for multiple shows.
01:23:46.52 --> 01:23:47.52 It was harsh.
01:23:47.52 --> 01:23:52.48 But what I had to do is well, you know, I had to go in perspective in a whole and
01:23:52.48 --> 01:23:53.48 world.
01:23:53.48 --> 01:23:56.08 Man, that was $66, right?
01:23:56.08 --> 01:23:59.16 And it was the kids and it was, they both wanted to see all the shows or whatever the
01:23:59.16 --> 01:24:00.16 thing was.
01:24:00.16 --> 01:24:04.20 So in her perspective, in her part of the world, that's a really big deal.
01:24:04.20 --> 01:24:09.60 And so that's, I think something you're going to do as a, as a, as a, as a human, always
01:24:09.60 --> 01:24:11.16 look at one of the people's perspectives are.
01:24:11.16 --> 01:24:14.48 And you know what, if people are pissed off, if your wife's freaking out because you didn't
01:24:14.48 --> 01:24:18.40 do the dishes, I got some really easy solution to that.
01:24:18.40 --> 01:24:20.84 Do the dishes.
01:24:20.84 --> 01:24:21.84 Just do the dishes.
01:24:21.84 --> 01:24:22.84 Yeah.
01:24:22.84 --> 01:24:26.92 You were put on some music and scrub some pots and pans.
01:24:26.92 --> 01:24:27.92 Let's do this.
01:24:27.92 --> 01:24:29.92 You know what, I'll scrub some pots and pans.
01:24:29.92 --> 01:24:30.92 Be happy to.
01:24:30.92 --> 01:24:31.92 Let's do this happen.
01:24:31.92 --> 01:24:32.92 Yeah.
01:24:32.92 --> 01:24:33.92 That's good, man.
01:24:33.92 --> 01:24:38.92 And then, you know, that if you have the ability and kind of the wherewithal to do that, to, to,
01:24:38.92 --> 01:24:42.80 really it's detaching, you detaching and looking at their situation, not looking at it from
01:24:42.80 --> 01:24:46.84 your own personal situation.
01:24:46.84 --> 01:24:50.40 If you can manage to do that, and I think it helps when someone reminds you, like, just
01:24:50.40 --> 01:24:51.80 like, you say, right now.
01:24:51.80 --> 01:24:54.64 And maybe someone will be like, hey, you know what, let me, let me go ahead and remember
01:24:54.64 --> 01:24:55.64 that next time.
01:24:55.64 --> 01:24:56.96 You know, all this stuff.
01:24:56.96 --> 01:25:00.60 And I say this to leaders all the time when I go out and work with companies.
01:25:00.60 --> 01:25:02.32 It's so much of it is just about awareness.
01:25:02.32 --> 01:25:03.32 Yes.
01:25:03.32 --> 01:25:06.96 When you become aware of the problem, you become aware of the mistake or you become aware
01:25:06.96 --> 01:25:07.96 of the solution.
01:25:07.96 --> 01:25:08.96 And it's there in front of you.
01:25:08.96 --> 01:25:09.96 Then it becomes very easy.
01:25:09.96 --> 01:25:14.60 The problem is, you people aren't aware of how easy it can be to solve some of these things.
01:25:14.60 --> 01:25:17.72 If you just make this small adjustment to your mentality.
01:25:17.72 --> 01:25:18.72 Yeah.
01:25:18.72 --> 01:25:24.96 The way of is the fact that you're freaking steaming red lining for the fifth time, your
01:25:24.96 --> 01:25:29.40 wife told you to do something when like I said, you're worrying about your guys getting
01:25:29.40 --> 01:25:30.64 killed yesterday.
01:25:30.64 --> 01:25:32.24 Yes, today is a go.
01:25:32.24 --> 01:25:33.24 Yeah.
01:25:33.24 --> 01:25:37.76 As one of my buddies, you used to say, when we are coming home from our first deployment,
01:25:37.76 --> 01:25:41.48 he says, can you believe this tomorrow?
01:25:41.48 --> 01:25:45.24 We're going to get on an aluminum tube and we're going to wake up back in Sydney.
01:25:45.24 --> 01:25:49.28 I was like, okay, man, take it easy.
01:25:49.28 --> 01:25:50.28 I'll stay.
01:25:50.28 --> 01:25:52.24 You need to be broke.
01:25:52.24 --> 01:25:53.88 All right.
01:25:53.88 --> 01:25:54.88 Anything else here?
01:25:54.88 --> 01:25:55.88 Yes.

01:28:37.28 --> 01:28:38.28 I don't know.

01:28:48.20 --> 01:28:49.20 Easy.
01:28:49.20 --> 01:28:50.20 All right.
01:28:50.20 --> 01:28:51.56 Let's get some questions.
01:28:51.56 --> 01:28:52.56 Okay.
01:28:52.56 --> 01:28:56.20 Question number one.
01:28:56.20 --> 01:29:01.72 Is taking extreme ownership the same as apologizing for failures or apologizing for
01:29:01.72 --> 01:29:02.84 others mistakes?
01:29:02.84 --> 01:29:07.08 I'm having difficulty separating these two concepts when I try to take ownership over
01:29:07.08 --> 01:29:08.08 failures.
01:29:08.08 --> 01:29:13.36 Does taking ownership of failure generally include in I'm sorry, X occurred?
01:29:13.36 --> 01:29:15.08 It's such or it's such.
01:29:15.08 --> 01:29:20.88 Well, it isn't just apologizing, right?
01:29:20.88 --> 01:29:23.36 It isn't just saying, oh, I apologize this happened.
01:29:23.36 --> 01:29:24.36 It's part of it.
01:29:24.36 --> 01:29:25.68 Part of ownership is apologizing.
01:29:25.68 --> 01:29:28.52 If you make a mistake, you've got to own it and generally you've got to say, hey, look,
01:29:28.52 --> 01:29:30.48 I'm sorry this happened.
01:29:30.48 --> 01:29:34.72 You've got to own that there's been a problem or a mistake or an issue.
01:29:34.72 --> 01:29:40.96 And that does include other people's mistakes, but you have to literally take ownership
01:29:40.96 --> 01:29:43.80 of them.
01:29:43.80 --> 01:29:47.08 You can't say, hey, I'm sorry these other people made mistakes.
01:29:47.08 --> 01:29:49.12 That's not what I'm talking about.
01:29:49.12 --> 01:29:54.08 And it's look, the mistakes that were made were actually my fault.
01:29:54.08 --> 01:30:01.68 And another important thing here is you can't just say, hey, guys, it's all my fault.
01:30:01.68 --> 01:30:05.52 You actually need to believe it yourself.
01:30:05.52 --> 01:30:11.76 You need to believe that you failed in the situation to do the right thing or make something
01:30:11.76 --> 01:30:14.68 happen or make the right decision or make the right call and do the right preparation
01:30:14.68 --> 01:30:18.32 or whatever it is that you're supposed to do, you need to do that.
01:30:18.32 --> 01:30:20.000 You need to believe that.
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.64 You can't just say it.
01:30:21.64 --> 01:30:25.12 And you say these mistakes were my fault.
01:30:25.12 --> 01:30:27.72 Here's why it was my fault.
01:30:27.72 --> 01:30:29.12 And yeah, I'm sorry that these things happen.
01:30:29.12 --> 01:30:31.16 I apologize with this happening.
01:30:31.16 --> 01:30:37.16 And some people see sorry as a sign of weakness.
01:30:37.16 --> 01:30:42.84 And honestly, there's some legal situations you might be in or some negotiations that you
01:30:42.84 --> 01:30:45.08 might be in where that might be true.
01:30:45.08 --> 01:30:52.000 But most of the time, I was just going to work in environment, inside of a team.
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000 Sorry is okay.
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:59.80 And in fact, an apology is often the first step in moving forward.
01:30:59.80 --> 01:31:06.92 And it's generally going to be a little bit of a blow to your ego.
01:31:06.92 --> 01:31:12.32 Now, and that's especially true because your mystery and ownership now or Mrs. extreme
01:31:12.32 --> 01:31:13.32 ownership.
01:31:13.32 --> 01:31:14.32 Guess what?
01:31:14.32 --> 01:31:15.88 That doesn't mean everyone else is not yet.
01:31:15.88 --> 01:31:16.88 They'll get there.
01:31:16.88 --> 01:31:18.28 But they're not there yet.
01:31:18.28 --> 01:31:20.32 So you apologize to someone.
01:31:20.32 --> 01:31:24.16 It's going to be a big blow to your ego, especially when someone says, you're damn right
01:31:24.16 --> 01:31:27.04 that was your fault.
01:31:27.04 --> 01:31:28.04 That's going to hurt your ego.
01:31:28.04 --> 01:31:30.80 I don't want to lash back out, but you can't.
01:31:30.80 --> 01:31:33.000 You've got to put your ego in check.
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000 And you got to go, hey, I understand.
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000 That is my fault.
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.20 Why I'm saying it's my fault?
01:31:37.20 --> 01:31:38.96 Because I truly believe it was my fault.
01:31:38.96 --> 01:31:40.000 Because it is.
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.60 Because it is your fault.
01:31:42.60 --> 01:31:46.40 So you have to be careful when someone glows don't let that get your head.
01:31:46.40 --> 01:31:48.36 That's what you have to do.
01:31:48.36 --> 01:31:51.20 And it's not just for you that you're doing this.
01:31:51.20 --> 01:31:55.68 It's because the team has to figure out what the problem is.
01:31:55.68 --> 01:31:58.28 Someone's going to take ownership of the problem, that's you.
01:31:58.28 --> 01:32:00.16 And then I'll tell you you get the problem solved.
01:32:00.16 --> 01:32:03.000 And I'll tell you something else.
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.92 And you might have predicted this.
01:32:05.92 --> 01:32:12.92 But my sorry and my apology comes with something else.
01:32:12.92 --> 01:32:14.92 99% of the time.
01:32:14.92 --> 01:32:19.28 And that's a good.
01:32:19.28 --> 01:32:22.24 So look, hey, I'm sorry that this happened.
01:32:22.24 --> 01:32:23.40 This is my fault.
01:32:23.40 --> 01:32:24.80 But I'm glad it happened now.
01:32:24.80 --> 01:32:25.80 Oh, yeah.
01:32:25.80 --> 01:32:27.48 Hey, you know what?
01:32:27.48 --> 01:32:29.32 I'm glad we made this mistake.
01:32:29.32 --> 01:32:30.48 We made this mistake right now.
01:32:30.48 --> 01:32:33.56 It's going to set us back a little bit good because when we're not going to make it with
01:32:33.56 --> 01:32:35.56 a client.
01:32:35.56 --> 01:32:39.04 Oh, this happened.
01:32:39.04 --> 01:32:40.48 This part of the project fell apart.
01:32:40.48 --> 01:32:41.48 Good.
01:32:41.48 --> 01:32:42.48 Now we can fix it.
01:32:42.48 --> 01:32:43.48 We know about it.
01:32:43.48 --> 01:32:45.60 Oh, this went sideways.
01:32:45.60 --> 01:32:46.60 I missed it.
01:32:46.60 --> 01:32:47.60 Good.
01:32:47.60 --> 01:32:49.60 I won't let it happen again.
01:32:49.60 --> 01:32:54.76 So throw yourself a little good on the end of your sorry.
01:32:54.76 --> 01:32:55.76 Yeah.
01:32:55.76 --> 01:32:56.76 All right.
01:32:56.76 --> 01:33:01.88 Yeah, a lot of times those problems or mistakes or whatever they add to that experience,
01:33:01.88 --> 01:33:04.04 like the experience of being there.
01:33:04.04 --> 01:33:08.04 You know, where let's say you go through a path and you make a wrong turn.
01:33:08.04 --> 01:33:10.04 Now you have that experience that that's a wrong turn.
01:33:10.04 --> 01:33:11.32 That's what that looks like.
01:33:11.32 --> 01:33:12.76 That's what that feels like.
01:33:12.76 --> 01:33:14.04 And guess what?
01:33:14.04 --> 01:33:15.88 We're going to avoid that in the future.
01:33:15.88 --> 01:33:19.76 Rather than a bunch of situations where we're, for example, one in the future where it's
01:33:19.76 --> 01:33:20.76 more detrimental.
01:33:20.76 --> 01:33:23.08 Now you don't run into that.
01:33:23.08 --> 01:33:24.08 Yeah.
01:33:24.08 --> 01:33:25.08 You learned.
01:33:25.08 --> 01:33:26.08 You learned.
01:33:26.08 --> 01:33:27.08 I probably think of it.
01:33:27.08 --> 01:33:28.08 So a video that said that.
01:33:28.08 --> 01:33:29.08 Be good.
01:33:29.08 --> 01:33:30.08 You learned.
01:33:30.08 --> 01:33:32.08 All right.
01:33:32.08 --> 01:33:35.20 Next question.
01:33:35.20 --> 01:33:37.80 Is there a way to be a straight shooter?
01:33:37.80 --> 01:33:38.80 Oh, sorry.
01:33:38.80 --> 01:33:47.96 Is there a way to be straight shooter jocco and not be a jerk or piss people off?
01:33:47.96 --> 01:33:52.96 You know, this is a touch you.
01:33:52.96 --> 01:33:58.20 Is everybody has so much respect for the straight shooter, right?
01:33:58.20 --> 01:34:01.84 Hey, that guy's a straight shooter and you want to be a straight shooter.
01:34:01.84 --> 01:34:04.04 You don't want to be someone that you don't want to be the opposite.
01:34:04.04 --> 01:34:05.04 What's the opposite of a straight shooter?
01:34:05.04 --> 01:34:06.04 That's like a liar.
01:34:06.04 --> 01:34:07.04 Right.
01:34:07.04 --> 01:34:08.04 The seever.
01:34:08.04 --> 01:34:09.04 A deceiver, right?
01:34:09.04 --> 01:34:11.20 So of course, we want to be the straight shooter.
01:34:11.20 --> 01:34:15.68 Let me tell you, it is very difficult to be a straight shooter with everybody.
01:34:15.68 --> 01:34:21.20 Even when you have a tremendous relationship with somebody, a tremendous relationship with
01:34:21.20 --> 01:34:22.20 somebody.
01:34:22.20 --> 01:34:25.04 Can you really be a straight shooter with them?
01:34:25.04 --> 01:34:27.16 A true straight shooter.
01:34:27.16 --> 01:34:37.88 I've been a true straight shooter with probably three or four people in my life.
01:34:37.88 --> 01:34:41.44 In my life, I've been a straight shooter with maybe three or four people.
01:34:41.44 --> 01:34:43.44 That's off the top of my head.
01:34:43.44 --> 01:34:46.04 But I'm just saying it's not a big number.
01:34:46.04 --> 01:34:52.52 It's got to be something that you are so in sync with.
01:34:52.52 --> 01:34:53.52 I'm thinking about that.
01:34:53.52 --> 01:34:58.12 I don't think that's impossible for me in my situation.
01:34:58.12 --> 01:34:59.40 It's hard to be a straight shooter.
01:34:59.40 --> 01:35:02.20 How can you reconcile being a straight shooter now?
01:35:02.20 --> 01:35:03.20 Consider what that means.
01:35:03.20 --> 01:35:07.04 But to be a straight shooter with somebody at all times.
01:35:07.04 --> 01:35:09.04 Can't really do that.
01:35:09.04 --> 01:35:10.28 What do we do instead?
01:35:10.28 --> 01:35:14.08 You've got to use the indirect approach, the indirect approach.
01:35:14.08 --> 01:35:15.80 I'm talking about this all the time.
01:35:15.80 --> 01:35:20.64 This is a nuance that people come out on podcasts 12.
01:35:20.64 --> 01:35:22.64 They say, hey, I heard you say this.
01:35:22.64 --> 01:35:27.06 I'm going to go, remember that question we got to ask, do you ever get told you're
01:35:27.06 --> 01:35:28.36 to direct to intense?
01:35:28.36 --> 01:35:31.16 It's like no, I don't get told that.
01:35:31.16 --> 01:35:33.92 Because I don't believe in being trying to be a straight shooter with everybody.
01:35:33.92 --> 01:35:37.64 What I believe in is trying to get my message across to people so that it gets absorbed
01:35:37.64 --> 01:35:39.64 by them.
01:35:39.64 --> 01:35:43.84 The minute you straight shoot somebody, their defenses go up and it becomes problematic.
01:35:43.84 --> 01:35:49.08 There's some indirect approaches when you have these discussions with people when you
01:35:49.08 --> 01:35:51.76 use conversation to get your point across.
01:35:51.76 --> 01:35:55.36 Hey, I was looking at this and I was wondering what I could do better.
01:35:55.36 --> 01:35:57.12 Can you help me?
01:35:57.12 --> 01:35:59.96 Or what can we do better?
01:35:59.96 --> 01:36:02.12 You throwing the Wii on it.
01:36:02.12 --> 01:36:03.84 Or you don't want to say something like that.
01:36:03.84 --> 01:36:06.40 You got so much going on right now.
01:36:06.40 --> 01:36:07.52 Do you want me to take anything off you?
01:36:07.52 --> 01:36:10.72 You want me to take that thing off you're played that's kind of like a small little
01:36:10.72 --> 01:36:11.72 detail.
01:36:11.72 --> 01:36:13.52 Do you want me to handle that?
01:36:13.52 --> 01:36:17.56 Or you know, hey, it seems like you're having a micromanage this guy over here.
01:36:17.56 --> 01:36:21.68 You want me to go straight in that out and run that?
01:36:21.68 --> 01:36:24.04 Or it seems like this guy is taking up too much of your time.
01:36:24.04 --> 01:36:30.64 You want me to take that over or take that person over or you know it's a good one.
01:36:30.64 --> 01:36:35.68 Is hey, can you help me with my team members?
01:36:35.68 --> 01:36:40.16 I just want to sit down with you and just like have you talked to me about what you
01:36:40.16 --> 01:36:42.68 see in my team members.
01:36:42.68 --> 01:36:49.52 And then when you're you're discussing your team members and other people even your peers
01:36:49.52 --> 01:36:50.80 and what they do good in that.
01:36:50.80 --> 01:36:55.16 But what you're really doing is you're just tossing some things their way, some little
01:36:55.16 --> 01:37:00.20 things their way so that they understand and they it and it's kind of like teaching
01:37:00.20 --> 01:37:03.72 to get to right when you teach when you teach a move or teaching anything when you teach
01:37:03.72 --> 01:37:06.40 a move you learn it better right?
01:37:06.40 --> 01:37:10.08 If you make somebody teach a move they're going to learn it better.
01:37:10.08 --> 01:37:16.000 So when you make someone sit down with you and go through the issues that people are having
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.20 it actually makes them self-reflect but they don't know it.
01:37:21.20 --> 01:37:23.80 But they reap the results of it.
01:37:23.80 --> 01:37:28.80 So that's a that's a crafty one that I've used a bunch.
01:37:28.80 --> 01:37:30.28 Let's see here's a good one.
01:37:30.28 --> 01:37:32.24 I think I'm letting you down.
01:37:32.24 --> 01:37:33.52 I don't think I'm doing a good enough job.
01:37:33.52 --> 01:37:37.20 You know it's like I think I'm just be careful with that one.
01:37:37.20 --> 01:37:41.04 It seems like if you if you hit the wrong tone, you're going to be careful with all these.
01:37:41.04 --> 01:37:42.04 You gotta be careful with all these.
01:37:42.04 --> 01:37:44.52 You gotta be tactful.
01:37:44.52 --> 01:37:49.92 You can ask some more direct questions but when you ask the more direct questions you
01:37:49.92 --> 01:37:56.28 gotta be sort of you gotta be true you gotta be you gotta come across as being very truthful
01:37:56.28 --> 01:37:58.12 in your in your inquisition.
01:37:58.12 --> 01:38:01.72 So for instance hey what was the strategy that you were thinking about over here?
01:38:01.72 --> 01:38:05.76 Like before this old thing of fellow part you know what to have but you know what you think
01:38:05.76 --> 01:38:09.78 or or hey what was what were you thinking about when you put this together because I
01:38:09.78 --> 01:38:12.48 I don't quite I don't quite get it.
01:38:12.48 --> 01:38:13.72 You gotta be careful that's another one.
01:38:13.72 --> 01:38:14.72 Yeah.
01:38:14.72 --> 01:38:15.72 You gotta be careful.
01:38:15.72 --> 01:38:16.72 You gotta be careful.
01:38:16.72 --> 01:38:17.72 That's okay.
01:38:17.72 --> 01:38:19.72 What were you thinking right?
01:38:19.72 --> 01:38:20.72 Right.
01:38:20.72 --> 01:38:21.72 Right.
01:38:21.72 --> 01:38:22.92 You gotta be soft with you.
01:38:22.92 --> 01:38:28.88 So it's much better to be indirect and most of these cases.
01:38:28.88 --> 01:38:31.60 And hopefully you can build relationships with people where you can be more direct or you
01:38:31.60 --> 01:38:35.50 can get that conversation to be where it needs to be to where you can get the key
01:38:35.50 --> 01:38:38.70 critical information across but it's very very challenging.
01:38:38.70 --> 01:38:39.70 Yeah.
01:38:39.70 --> 01:38:42.94 And again, it ain't it's not that challenging it's not impossible I did it with everybody
01:38:42.94 --> 01:38:43.94 all the time.
01:38:43.94 --> 01:38:47.50 I always had got my point across to people.
01:38:47.50 --> 01:38:54.10 Always you know and I'll tell you this is something when I would straight shoot somebody
01:38:54.10 --> 01:39:01.46 I would and this is if I really needed to straight shoot somebody I would write them
01:39:01.46 --> 01:39:11.10 a very lengthy email to say hey here's what's going on here's what I'm saying and I would
01:39:11.10 --> 01:39:17.90 really craft it with a lot of patience and and then I would either do once I wrote the
01:39:17.90 --> 01:39:22.98 email I would either use that and wouldn't send it but I'd use it as a guide to myself
01:39:22.98 --> 01:39:26.46 like okay this is the conversation I'm gonna have or I'd send it to them for real.
01:39:26.46 --> 01:39:27.46 Like a deal.
01:39:27.46 --> 01:39:30.82 Yeah like a deal note you know I actually read one of those.
01:39:30.82 --> 01:39:36.50 I read one of those on on on on on on on or two or five I think it was number five that
01:39:36.50 --> 01:39:39.98 is one of those things that I did I said okay you know what I got to help this guy out
01:39:39.98 --> 01:39:43.90 got to be direct with them he's making some mistakes I want him do better here's a
01:39:43.90 --> 01:39:50.66 little deal note for you get you square away the thing is these this is definitely hard
01:39:50.66 --> 01:39:55.06 but it's not impossible you got to just have the open mind you got to use your
01:39:55.06 --> 01:40:00.74 attack you got to use your judgment and you got to build relationships and have conversations with people
01:40:00.74 --> 01:40:06.82 and and know what your intention is in the conversation and just keep slowly moving in that
01:40:06.82 --> 01:40:07.82 direction.
01:40:07.82 --> 01:40:13.30 You know what I a tip and I'm gonna say this tip because I like when people do it to me
01:40:13.30 --> 01:40:20.50 when they're like correcting me or whatever is sprinkling little comments about the stuff
01:40:20.50 --> 01:40:22.30 that that they did right.
01:40:22.30 --> 01:40:24.30 Yeah that's a common practice.
01:40:24.30 --> 01:40:29.34 Yeah but when you do that though you add in this you add in and that's what I like about
01:40:29.34 --> 01:40:33.82 you you do this you know so it's you know so if you add in that's what I like about you
01:40:33.82 --> 01:40:38.10 it kind of individualizes that person like I'm the guy who does that you know that good
01:40:38.10 --> 01:40:41.18 part so it gives them that confidence so it's kind of like yeah tell me more kind of
01:40:41.18 --> 01:40:47.18 attitude and then at the end doing like something along the lines of like yeah good
01:40:47.18 --> 01:40:50.82 thanks you know thanks for the time or whatever and then be like I got your back yeah kind
01:40:50.82 --> 01:40:51.82 of lead.
01:40:51.82 --> 01:40:56.70 Well I mean we could go over techniques all night long those are both good ones you know
01:40:56.70 --> 01:41:01.02 another one is like hey listen I think you can be a top performer here I think you're
01:41:01.02 --> 01:41:04.02 gonna this is if you're talking to someone that's you know like a subordinate I think
01:41:04.02 --> 01:41:08.76 you can be a top performer here there's here's what you're kicking ass out yes this
01:41:08.76 --> 01:41:13.78 this and this here's this these two things right here if we can get these fixed you're
01:41:13.78 --> 01:41:18.38 going platinum when we get these things when we get you know you're gonna pause it look
01:41:18.38 --> 01:41:22.50 you I'm I'm imagining in the sense of you telling me this and like you get
01:41:22.50 --> 01:41:28.34 to yourself you know yeah so like they just say like when I'd be like hey and I'd
01:41:28.34 --> 01:41:32.74 ask him to say I'm in this position and he'd be like like yeah then later on you
01:41:32.74 --> 01:41:36.06 know I text him what are the hey thanks for going over this with me just like
01:41:36.06 --> 01:41:39.54 Cabrol you don't keep it up and you can be like a world champion you just say that
01:41:39.54 --> 01:41:42.86 and I don't know who else he says that to everybody I don't know he's never said
01:41:42.86 --> 01:41:48.18 that to me that's because we hate each other but for that moment I'm like
01:41:48.18 --> 01:41:53.38 hell yeah you know like I hope he corrects me more I hope he tells me how to do
01:41:53.38 --> 01:41:56.22 this because he obviously just like I was saying you know you could be a top
01:41:56.22 --> 01:42:00.78 performer here yeah tell me what else what can I do what can I do and actually the
01:42:00.78 --> 01:42:07.74 point that you're making is very good point which is you know picture going to
01:42:07.74 --> 01:42:10.74 perspective of the other person and what is it gonna sound like to them and that's
01:42:10.74 --> 01:42:15.74 a smart thing to do so you're you're hearing what you would hear if you were
01:42:15.74 --> 01:42:24.90 them yeah yeah indirect people be indirect it's harder it's challenging it takes
01:42:24.90 --> 01:42:30.50 more time it takes more patience and it is way more effective in fact
01:42:30.50 --> 01:42:34.58 and we talked about how before like some people they'll be like hey I'm just
01:42:34.58 --> 01:42:38.18 I'm just I tell it how it is you know I tell how it is and if you don't like
01:42:38.18 --> 01:42:42.62 you kind of think and all right go ahead and do that but see how that works out for
01:42:42.62 --> 01:42:45.38 you know see how many people follow you see many people want to listen to you
01:42:45.38 --> 01:42:50.26 many people want to be around you even you know I like the indirect approach to
01:42:50.26 --> 01:42:56.78 next question joko what is the number one philosophical lesson that you've
01:42:56.78 --> 01:43:10.86 learned from jiu jitsu yeah so jiu jitsu emphasizes so much of what I believe
01:43:10.86 --> 01:43:18.02 that it's tough to narrow down but I will but I will throw some things out
01:43:18.02 --> 01:43:23.18 there that kind of our part of jiu jitsu and our part of what I believe
01:43:23.18 --> 01:43:30.82 first of all we just talked about being indirect an indirect attacks flanking
01:43:30.82 --> 01:43:34.38 that's what you have to do in jiu jitsu you have to set things up you have to
01:43:34.38 --> 01:43:38.94 detach you have to detach from the chaos and from the emotional you cannot get
01:43:38.94 --> 01:43:42.62 emotional on the mat attack the flanks you gotta hit people where they're
01:43:42.62 --> 01:43:47.34 expecting it you gotta have a plan but you gotta be ready to adapt you gotta
01:43:47.34 --> 01:43:53.70 constantly improve your position you gotta have fun while you're doing it you
01:43:53.70 --> 01:43:57.02 gotta practice being in bad situations you gotta make your training is
01:43:57.02 --> 01:44:01.06 realistic as possible right these are all things I talk about these in all
01:44:01.06 --> 01:44:08.90 aspects of combat and in business and in life you gotta be physically fit
01:44:08.90 --> 01:44:14.50 to your mind stay sharp that's true true in jiu jitsu it's true in combat it's
01:44:14.50 --> 01:44:20.78 true in life you gotta know when to tap right you gotta know when to tap you
01:44:20.78 --> 01:44:24.86 gotta know when to give up on a single battle so that you don't lose the whole
01:44:24.86 --> 01:44:30.54 war gotta train for worst case scenarios you gotta start with that person on
01:44:30.54 --> 01:44:38.18 your back gotta start with the person with you in an arm lock and training for
01:44:38.18 --> 01:44:41.26 combat you gotta train for those worst case scenarios where you're outnumbered
01:44:41.26 --> 01:44:43.98 you got a bunker position and there's shooting paintball at you and you got
01:44:43.98 --> 01:44:47.42 down men that's what you gotta do you gotta train for the worst case scenarios
01:44:47.42 --> 01:44:52.78 and same thing with business I work with like sales group sometimes and they'll
01:44:52.78 --> 01:44:58.78 do role play and I'll say you know be the worst customer you can possibly be
01:44:58.78 --> 01:45:03.14 exactly when this person meets a normal human they they know how to knock it out
01:45:03.14 --> 01:45:09.34 of the park here's another one from jiu jitsu basically don't judge a book by
01:45:09.34 --> 01:45:13.46 it's cover right because you don't know if the person that you're about the
01:45:13.46 --> 01:45:19.34 slap is Jeff Glover or his Dean Lister or Jill Tudor or Joel Tudor you don't
01:45:19.34 --> 01:45:23.66 know what's gonna happen so you don't judge a book by it's cover yeah I mean Dean
01:45:23.66 --> 01:45:27.22 you'd be less apt to slap than you would Jeff Glover I guess that's a good
01:45:27.22 --> 01:45:31.58 point Dean you can kind of judge by the cover yeah the cover is pretty evident but
01:45:31.58 --> 01:45:38.18 Jeffy or Joel yeah you know those guys weigh 150 pounds and you know a surfer
01:45:38.18 --> 01:45:43.30 guy and a whatever Jeff is I don't know what genre of human you put Jeff into
01:45:43.30 --> 01:45:53.30 but you wouldn't think that he would throw a dars choke on your face so that's
01:45:53.30 --> 01:45:58.82 that prioritize an execute in the jiu jitsu I mean we just talked about it
01:45:58.82 --> 01:46:02.94 14 times tonight for combat talk about in business all the time you got to
01:46:02.94 --> 01:46:05.18 make sure that the initiatives that you're running you don't have 38
01:46:05.18 --> 01:46:08.90 initiatives and you jitsu guess what you hear this all the time you're
01:46:08.90 --> 01:46:12.98 getting about to get choked you got to protect your neck number one you got to
01:46:12.98 --> 01:46:15.74 protect your neck yeah then you can worry about your leg and then you can
01:46:15.74 --> 01:46:17.90 worry about your arm and the hooks and everything else which got to protect the
01:46:17.90 --> 01:46:25.26 neck you got to prioritize yeah gotta keep things simple you got to create
01:46:25.26 --> 01:46:31.02 you got to have an open mind you got to be creative and look for different ways
01:46:31.02 --> 01:46:35.34 to win and different things to do you got to make sure you don't get trapped in
01:46:35.34 --> 01:46:42.34 your ruts mentally trapped in a rut this happens to me everybody yeah
01:46:42.34 --> 01:46:45.46 happens to me but I only know what I can tell you about me and then as I get
01:46:45.46 --> 01:46:51.78 trapped in ruts with your jitsu where I get I get stuck in something and I'll
01:46:51.78 --> 01:46:56.78 just go with one move for a long period of time you got to be careful that I
01:46:56.78 --> 01:47:05.14 need to be better about that discipline equals freedom so with you jitsu the
01:47:05.14 --> 01:47:11.22 more disciplined you are in training the more freedom you have on the mat so
01:47:11.22 --> 01:47:16.66 the more you train the more you work the more you drill the more you can move
01:47:16.66 --> 01:47:21.70 the more you can escape the more you can create the more you can finish you
01:47:21.70 --> 01:47:26.02 and not to mention the fear that it eliminates because like you know I'll
01:47:26.02 --> 01:47:28.86 like let's say you're not that discipline you take two weeks off a lot of
01:47:28.86 --> 01:47:32.22 time when you come back from that two weeks like you have that added element of
01:47:32.22 --> 01:47:37.94 nervousness like dang am I gonna gas or am I gonna get you know tapped out in front
01:47:37.94 --> 01:47:41.98 of everybody when you know when you know maybe there's a higher expectation on
01:47:41.98 --> 01:47:53.14 me or something like that yeah no I don't have that yeah part of it though
01:47:53.14 --> 01:47:58.66 for sure but I would say the number one philosophical lesson I guess is
01:47:58.66 --> 01:48:04.50 the philosophical lesson is the same thing that I learned from combat and that's
01:48:04.50 --> 01:48:10.10 humility in jitsu is absolutely one of the most humbling experiences in the
01:48:10.10 --> 01:48:13.62 world and we've actually I got people now that have started jiu jitsu
01:48:13.62 --> 01:48:19.66 because the podcast and they say oh I just did my first jiu jitsu class damn
01:48:19.66 --> 01:48:25.98 that was humbling it is extremely humbling you're gonna get be you're never
01:48:25.98 --> 01:48:30.02 gonna know everything you're always gonna be learning that there's other ways
01:48:30.02 --> 01:48:36.42 to do things and somebody that just started can come up with amazing techniques
01:48:36.42 --> 01:48:43.18 and that's humbling and there's other martial arts that have better moves
01:48:43.18 --> 01:48:47.50 that you need to pay attention to like wrestling has better take downs like
01:48:47.50 --> 01:48:52.46 sombo with the leg locks and catch wrestling some of those things that are
01:48:52.46 --> 01:48:56.06 better moves and you need to apply those and guess what you still need to know
01:48:56.06 --> 01:49:01.98 how to strike because it can be hard to take people down so you know how to
01:49:01.98 --> 01:49:06.10 how to strike and you can't be cocky and you can't be over confident because
01:49:06.10 --> 01:49:14.42 the bottom line is in jiu jitsu you will get beat and you will get beat by
01:49:14.42 --> 01:49:22.50 smaller guys by weaker guys by older guys you're gonna get beat and there's
01:49:22.50 --> 01:49:30.90 somebody that's better than you and if you don't like that or if your ego
01:49:30.90 --> 01:49:38.90 doesn't like that then you gotta find a new game to play yeah because you need
01:49:38.90 --> 01:49:46.42 to find a softer game or an easier game because jiu jitsu is honest yeah and
01:49:46.42 --> 01:49:51.50 you cannot escape that and that's as it should be and it's of course this
01:49:51.50 --> 01:49:57.78 philosophical this philosophy is something that I definitely carried over to
01:49:57.78 --> 01:50:03.14 combat and carry over to when I talk to businesses and carry over to life you
01:50:03.14 --> 01:50:06.74 can't be over confident you can't be over confident you're never gonna think
01:50:06.74 --> 01:50:12.06 you know everything you have to respect the enemy that's part of humility you
01:50:12.06 --> 01:50:14.94 got to respect your if you're not humble you don't respect your enemy you don't
01:50:14.94 --> 01:50:23.58 respect your opponent you don't respect your competitor and if you don't that's
01:50:23.58 --> 01:50:28.14 when you're gonna get caught so to me humility is the most important thing
01:50:28.14 --> 01:50:35.86 that jiu jitsu teaches you yeah and you know it's kind of a can be kind of
01:50:35.86 --> 01:50:42.02 but not a trick yeah I'll have a call to the tricks because okay you got
01:50:42.02 --> 01:50:46.02 it you got to maintain the humility right but that humility will be tested if
01:50:46.02 --> 01:50:50.74 you stick with it so I don't tell you a little quick story about that test being
01:50:50.74 --> 01:50:58.02 stood upon me it was like a little after I got my purple belt I was really
01:50:58.02 --> 01:51:03.82 like really hit my stride I was competing a lot in winning and you were
01:51:03.82 --> 01:51:07.58 trained with me a lot back yes that was that was right at that time when I was
01:51:07.58 --> 01:51:12.22 training with you and you were you know when I you know if there was a
01:51:12.22 --> 01:51:19.42 little mentorship going on yeah that was the exact time yeah and and I was like
01:51:19.42 --> 01:51:22.86 yeah I started to kind of you know give me into my own height you know like oh
01:51:22.86 --> 01:51:30.10 I'm the man not outwardly but on the inside and just fun jiu jitsu man gets
01:51:30.10 --> 01:51:35.30 cocky on the inside yeah and here's thing a lot of people that's how you know
01:51:35.30 --> 01:51:38.34 it in fact a little bit of that is good because you get a confidence that
01:51:38.34 --> 01:51:42.98 hunger to even learn more and be better so I had that and then Greg and
01:51:42.98 --> 01:51:47.10 rolled with Greg since I did know him as good but I knew him but not as good as I
01:51:47.10 --> 01:51:50.62 do now and last time I wanted to say the last time I rolled with him I was a
01:51:50.62 --> 01:51:56.06 white belt long time ago and he just would destroy me so I was like Greg's like oh
01:51:56.06 --> 01:51:58.86 yeah you know congratulations you know you've been winning and stuff like that
01:51:58.86 --> 01:52:02.46 was like oh yeah he's like all right yeah let's roll so I'm like I let me
01:52:02.46 --> 01:52:07.34 chill yeah I'm thinking in my mind yeah I've been winning here let me go
01:52:07.34 --> 01:52:10.74 ahead and show you my new stuff you know it's gonna show Greg in my own
01:52:10.74 --> 01:52:16.02 mind yeah and Greg took me like I was a white belt again immediately the kind
01:52:16.02 --> 01:52:19.50 where he literally nothing I did work and everything he did work there's like
01:52:19.50 --> 01:52:23.22 it's like he did a step one step two step three tap me out step one
01:52:23.22 --> 01:52:30.34 step two set tap me out and that was the time where I got put from like the
01:52:30.34 --> 01:52:34.06 top of the mountain in my own head right to the bottom of the mountain literally
01:52:34.06 --> 01:52:37.50 to the bottom not to not almost at the bottom to the bottom of the mountain yeah
01:52:37.50 --> 01:52:42.06 that's that's it's actually it's actually so good when that happens and
01:52:42.06 --> 01:52:47.70 and actually it's something I occasionally do you get to super humbling occasionally
01:52:47.70 --> 01:52:55.54 you get someone that is really really good and they don't recognize they don't
01:52:55.54 --> 01:52:59.54 come up against people all the time that are they don't come up against
01:52:59.54 --> 01:53:05.54 people very often that are better than them yeah most people in the beginning
01:53:05.54 --> 01:53:10.30 you have you have several years of of being beat down but occasionally
01:53:10.30 --> 01:53:13.74 you get something that's a great wrestler or maybe they were a judo player or
01:53:13.74 --> 01:53:16.46 something so they come into the game or they're just super strong or they're
01:53:16.46 --> 01:53:20.58 just a freak athlete and so they very quickly you know in a matter of six
01:53:20.58 --> 01:53:24.54 months to a year all of a sudden they're doing really well yeah sometimes those
01:53:24.54 --> 01:53:28.54 people sometimes those people mentally they might be good at your jitzie but
01:53:28.54 --> 01:53:33.74 they don't they don't mentally get it and they become really bullies and that's
01:53:33.74 --> 01:53:37.02 that's that's one of the it doesn't happen that often like I said but it
01:53:37.02 --> 01:53:40.38 doesn't occasionally happen where you get somebody that just is a dominant
01:53:40.38 --> 01:53:45.42 force they don't get humble enough and and they don't because even if you
01:53:45.42 --> 01:53:48.70 don't actually get humbled jiu jitsu normally in the beginning you learn
01:53:48.70 --> 01:53:53.22 like oh because one of the things I say to people is I'm not you know because
01:53:53.22 --> 01:53:57.50 I can tap you but doesn't mean that I'm a better human than you just means I
01:53:57.50 --> 01:54:01.58 train more jiu jitsu than you this you know what I mean that's all it means and
01:54:01.58 --> 01:54:05.10 that means that someone else has trained in jiu jiu more than me and they
01:54:05.10 --> 01:54:09.66 can beat me and that's just what it is but sometimes people think that because
01:54:09.66 --> 01:54:15.42 they can tap somebody out that they're better than them yeah as a human yeah
01:54:15.42 --> 01:54:19.42 there is a spirit and that's not a good attitude to have that's not what you
01:54:19.42 --> 01:54:22.62 jiu jitsu should be about yeah and those guys a lot of times because they
01:54:22.62 --> 01:54:27.34 and this is just kind of a one way to put it they don't pay their dues so to speak
01:54:27.34 --> 01:54:30.38 you know like a normal way they don't get the humility lesson over and over and
01:54:30.38 --> 01:54:33.90 over again they get it like a few times within the overcomment quickly yeah and
01:54:33.90 --> 01:54:40.70 it out ways that way yeah so you gotta be careful of that yeah just just be just
01:54:40.70 --> 01:54:43.90 be careful that if you're if you're a person that's naturally really a depth of
01:54:43.90 --> 01:54:49.90 jiu jitsu make sure you're not getting turning into a bully yeah and a lot of
01:54:49.90 --> 01:54:52.78 times that can block you from learning oh definitely block you because it's like
01:54:52.78 --> 01:54:55.98 why would I why would I start learning all this weirdo game like if you're
01:54:55.98 --> 01:55:00.38 strong wrestler like why would I start learning bottom game yeah if when I'm
01:55:00.38 --> 01:55:03.34 killing with all this other stuff I mean listen because there's someone that's a better
01:55:03.34 --> 01:55:07.10 wrestler than you yeah that's why or just knows the combination because a lot of times
01:55:07.82 --> 01:55:13.02 certain guys they'll they'll know the combo to beat wrestling yeah without having to do
01:55:13.02 --> 01:55:18.54 wrestling yeah make some guys that they're just like that you know so part of it
01:55:18.54 --> 01:55:25.34 jiu jitsu okay next question have you ever been so dug in on a solution or an
01:55:25.34 --> 01:55:29.82 opinion that it felt impossible to admit that you were in fact wrong
01:55:29.82 --> 01:55:36.38 so I actually almost gave up on this question and and
01:55:37.02 --> 01:55:43.98 because it's been I learned this lesson a long time ago that again the humility that you
01:55:43.98 --> 01:55:52.38 get from jiu jitsu and from combat and from life is that I very seldom dig in on
01:55:52.38 --> 01:55:56.62 something that I'm not 100% sure of yeah and and which means I don't dig in on a
01:55:56.62 --> 01:56:00.30 lot because I'm not a 100% sure of much right who can be a 100% sure of a lot of things
01:56:01.34 --> 01:56:05.66 and when I do do that it's not that hard for me to realize that I'm wrong
01:56:05.66 --> 01:56:08.70 stifle my ego admit it in change course it's not that big of a deal to me
01:56:11.02 --> 01:56:15.98 when I like I said when I do dig in on a subject or on a decision it's because I know
01:56:17.82 --> 01:56:22.78 like almost to a 100% certainty that I'm right otherwise I'm gonna leave myself a little bit of an
01:56:22.78 --> 01:56:29.26 out I'm not gonna just dig in on things that I can't be positive about because why
01:56:29.26 --> 01:56:36.46 would I why would I do that now when I end up being wrong if I do take a stance on
01:56:36.46 --> 01:56:40.14 something it's no big deal I'm gonna use that as an opportunity to show that I'm
01:56:40.14 --> 01:56:43.82 humble and show that I can admit when I'm wrong I'm gonna take advantage of a good
01:56:43.82 --> 01:56:51.26 I'm wrong good and you know so I would say just keep your options open keep an
01:56:51.26 --> 01:56:59.58 open mind when you feel yourself or your ego is digging in just check yourself
01:57:00.70 --> 01:57:10.54 and admit that you're wrong and move on and one thing I think that happens with people is people
01:57:10.54 --> 01:57:20.22 think that digging in and having a strong 100% opinion makes them a pure stronger or it makes
01:57:20.22 --> 01:57:25.90 their idea pure stronger but I don't think so I'm not saying to be wishy washy on stuff
01:57:25.90 --> 01:57:29.34 I'm just saying I don't have an open mind because I think that's the ultimate strength
01:57:31.42 --> 01:57:36.38 that's kind of my opinion I mean the last time I came close to digging in I was advising a company
01:57:36.94 --> 01:57:42.94 and they were going through some rough a little bit of a rough patch and they started multiple
01:57:42.94 --> 01:57:47.58 initiatives to try and turn some some things around and one of the initiatives
01:57:47.58 --> 01:57:53.50 of all the initiatives there was a couple that the CEO wanted done immediately and two of
01:57:53.50 --> 01:58:00.06 those initiatives when I looked at them I thought that they were redundant and so I said look
01:58:00.06 --> 01:58:04.86 I wouldn't waste I wouldn't do both these initiatives just pick one I think this one's the
01:58:04.86 --> 01:58:09.42 better one just do this one and I think it'll cover the problem and I convinced them
01:58:10.14 --> 01:58:13.26 and it was pretty easy to convince them because they were had limited resources at the time
01:58:13.26 --> 01:58:16.94 and limited assets so it wasn't like they had a bunch of stuff to spread around
01:58:16.94 --> 01:58:20.62 but he was pretty sad on it but I convinced them otherwise and he agreed and within a matter of
01:58:20.62 --> 01:58:25.98 days it started to look like I was wrong and it started to look like both systems were going to
01:58:25.98 --> 01:58:35.26 be needed to solve that specific issue so I didn't like wait I didn't say oh I hope that things go
01:58:35.26 --> 01:58:39.50 I said look hey I think I was wrong about this I think you were right let's get the other
01:58:39.50 --> 01:58:45.82 initiative going and let's get this problem covered and that's it and I'm telling you he didn't
01:58:45.82 --> 01:58:52.86 lose respect for me because I said hey I'm wrong after a few days of watching what the results are
01:58:52.86 --> 01:59:00.14 and making an early decision he actually thought it was awesome and he knew he's like hey I wish
01:59:00.14 --> 01:59:04.06 everyone could admit when they were wrong like that it would make everything around here so much
01:59:04.06 --> 01:59:08.30 easier and I said well that's why I'm here in the first place right is to help with that so
01:59:10.54 --> 01:59:15.42 just be conscious when you dig in you know because when you dig in you're actually when you
01:59:15.42 --> 01:59:22.06 dig in you're taking away your ability to maneuver oh yeah you don't want to do that it's good so
01:59:22.94 --> 01:59:32.06 so watch out now should I read this question because this is a question for echo Charles
01:59:32.62 --> 01:59:36.86 so that means I get you well it's two questions actually but I put them together because they're
01:59:36.86 --> 01:59:44.70 pretty close jocca willing what brought you and echo Charles together can we get the backstory there
01:59:44.70 --> 01:59:52.22 I like the chemistry echo Charles question for you to answer on jocco podcast what have you
01:59:52.22 --> 02:00:01.58 learned from jocco and how has your life changed since this is echo's first response to a question
02:00:03.82 --> 02:00:12.06 don't screw it up here we go I'll tackle you yeah yeah of course which is funny because that's kind
02:00:12.06 --> 02:00:16.46 of how what brought us together we're a part of what brought us together and I think it's good
02:00:16.46 --> 02:00:20.70 that I answer this part because you probably remember a lot less of it so
02:00:24.86 --> 02:00:31.74 I would say it was oh six I'd seen you like the first you know whatever within the first year
02:00:31.74 --> 02:00:36.70 of joining with Dean in 05 but I didn't know you didn't talk to you nothing like that I just
02:00:36.70 --> 02:00:43.98 had heard of you from Dean and then in like 06 when we moved over to the boxing club I rolled
02:00:43.98 --> 02:00:50.22 with you one time I was still a white belt and so that could have been still 05 I don't know and then
02:00:50.22 --> 02:00:56.22 you know you beat me up and you kind of you were just more like this stoic guy basically I would
02:00:56.22 --> 02:01:01.34 imagine the same guy that people interpret you to be from the outside you know kind of like not
02:01:01.34 --> 02:01:06.86 intense but just real like yeah just real matter of fact you know so you beat me up or whatever and
02:01:06.86 --> 02:01:11.42 then I was so I since I had already heard of you were Dean's black belt and you know all this stuff
02:01:11.42 --> 02:01:16.46 that I was like yeah that's about right you know he's you know good you do whatever beat me up
02:01:16.46 --> 02:01:20.78 but that wasn't really saying much because everyone was beating me up and then time went on I didn't
02:01:20.78 --> 02:01:26.78 see you for a while and then when I started to kind of get lost I was trained with Brent
02:01:26.78 --> 02:01:32.78 Brent yeah I was training with him and then with Alias a little bit and then I would come back
02:01:33.50 --> 02:01:38.46 I was competing and then you were just around for whatever reason and then yeah I just started
02:01:38.46 --> 02:01:44.06 training with you and I think that's the one we opened victory right yes is around the same time yeah
02:01:44.06 --> 02:01:51.66 yeah exactly and then um yeah well funny is that you never came off like once like like new you like
02:01:51.66 --> 02:01:56.22 immediately you never came off as this super intense person like it was more like you were just
02:01:56.22 --> 02:02:03.66 sarcastic like well you know like any other like any other of my friends but you could still always
02:02:03.66 --> 02:02:07.82 tell that there are something behind the scenes you know you know Darrogens said like he's seeing you
02:02:07.82 --> 02:02:12.86 and he was like there's I don't know this guy you know it's kind of got that same feeling but you
02:02:12.86 --> 02:02:20.54 were always just like oh yeah this real matter fact but fun funny like kind of person whatever
02:02:20.54 --> 02:02:26.62 like but when I say matter fact I mean like um like that one this one tournament when uh it was kind
02:02:26.62 --> 02:02:31.10 of later where I lost two genre Roberts and you got me with a go-go plata and you know when you
02:02:31.10 --> 02:02:36.86 lose in jujitsu training and that was the first time I lost in since I went advance you know because
02:02:36.86 --> 02:02:42.94 those doing a lot of no-gui I had never lost and genre Roberts gets me with a go-go plata so instead of
02:02:42.94 --> 02:02:46.38 you saying hey you know it's okay here nothing like that you send me a text you're sitting across
02:02:46.38 --> 02:02:51.26 the arena you're right there you send me a text hey you got caught with a go-go that's got a sting
02:02:51.26 --> 02:02:57.02 that's not a tournament it's not practice you can say that could stuff it was like oh whatever
02:02:57.02 --> 02:03:03.18 but I think that um that you know training together and just kind of getting you you you kind of
02:03:03.18 --> 02:03:09.42 had that thing that you could say that kind of stuff because really it's not that serious you know
02:03:09.42 --> 02:03:14.22 yeah when I don't think I don't there's there's not many people who could have conveyed that though
02:03:14.22 --> 02:03:20.14 you know it came it I think it had to come from you anyway so yeah that's kind of how
02:03:21.42 --> 02:03:29.58 we met and then um kind of after a while how did the idea of a podcast come up because we we kind
02:03:29.58 --> 02:03:35.50 of talked about that a little bit before I kind of forget the formation but it was in my mind
02:03:35.50 --> 02:03:40.22 when I went on jailroguins I think we had talked about hey you know we should do something I think
02:03:40.22 --> 02:03:45.02 you said to me like hey you should do it and so when I went on jailroguins and he said you should do a
02:03:45.02 --> 02:03:50.38 podcast I think what Tim Ferriss said hey you should do a podcast and then I kind of be you being
02:03:50.38 --> 02:03:56.22 a techie sound guy video guy I just said hey do you know how to make a podcast yeah that's right
02:03:56.22 --> 02:03:59.98 I just said hey how do you you know how to make a podcast so I need to make one yeah
02:03:59.98 --> 02:04:05.42 yeah yeah because everything to be just a total caveman right get how do you do I need a tape recorder
02:04:05.42 --> 02:04:11.02 what do I need you know that's what my answer then you said yeah I know I know how to do that I could
02:04:11.02 --> 02:04:18.22 make that happen and then you said it'd be cool instead of just you sitting there talking if you
02:04:18.22 --> 02:04:22.06 had someone to talk to and I said yeah you're right that would be cool and then you said it'd be cool
02:04:22.06 --> 02:04:30.30 if it was me yeah well my my selling point was that strange if it's just you right just sitting there
02:04:30.30 --> 02:04:34.46 you know it's it's more strange and it's better if you have someone to kind of bounce things off
02:04:34.46 --> 02:04:39.02 okay especially someone who can kind of be like oh I'm just every day guy like so I can like
02:04:39.02 --> 02:04:42.06 ask questions that kind of reiterate the point right just someone who might not get it
02:04:43.10 --> 02:04:49.34 yeah I had an awful lot out you know in my mind I did anyway but yeah then yeah obviously Joe
02:04:49.34 --> 02:04:55.34 Rogan was kind of the tipping point when he suggested it yeah yeah no that was a good gradient
02:04:55.34 --> 02:04:59.82 side from Joe Rogan and I'm glad he did and I'm glad you did and look at we did
02:04:59.82 --> 02:05:07.82 make this podcast happen so to answer the question what have I learned and this is interesting
02:05:07.82 --> 02:05:12.86 because I asked myself this exact same question like a week ago because I am literally a different
02:05:12.86 --> 02:05:18.54 person in ways that kind of are kind of surprising in a way so I'd say the first thing that's kind
02:05:18.54 --> 02:05:25.98 of kind of not that surprising but it's it's very prevalent is when people blame when I see people
02:05:25.98 --> 02:05:31.26 blaming other people or blaming me or I feel the compulsion to blame someone else it stands out
02:05:31.26 --> 02:05:37.58 like a sore thumb almost like if if I've been feeling that and it like almost like if I want to say
02:05:37.58 --> 02:05:43.10 something to to indicate that I'm going to blame someone or something it's almost like a red flag like
02:05:43.10 --> 02:05:48.86 I'm not allowed to do that in my own mind it's like it's hard in fast rule and like I said they just
02:05:48.86 --> 02:05:54.78 stand out like a sore thumb everywhere though on TV you know the guy not even my conversation oh I
02:05:54.78 --> 02:05:59.66 see what you're doing right there you know so it's like it's like your whole way of life in that
02:05:59.66 --> 02:06:06.06 regard is just shifted extreme ownership and the awareness of that seeing it and other people
02:06:06.06 --> 02:06:10.62 or lack of it and other people definitely stands out like crazy once you start thinking about it
02:06:10.62 --> 02:06:16.14 yeah and I have the luxury of being around you talking about these things talking about examples of it
02:06:16.70 --> 02:06:21.74 every week right so throughout the week I'm like I can't even help but notice it you know and it's
02:06:21.74 --> 02:06:26.46 right it helps man because it applies to everyone and everything like most relationships are going to
02:06:26.46 --> 02:06:33.02 apply these principles you know if you're involved in them so yeah it's all automatic now so so
02:06:33.02 --> 02:06:40.14 when it comes to ownership and really blaming myself if anyone and focusing on my responsibility
02:06:40.14 --> 02:06:45.02 in any scenario whatever it comes automatic now I would say so huge stuff I mean whether I make
02:06:45.02 --> 02:06:50.86 the right choices that's always going to be working probably progress I think but as far as that attitude
02:06:50.86 --> 02:07:00.38 it's automatic now that's awesome and then in regards to okay so I've always been into working
02:07:00.38 --> 02:07:09.02 out and so me not feeling like working out is I've always felt like working out so
02:07:11.58 --> 02:07:16.62 as far as not feeling like it that wasn't really a factor but in a bunch of other things in life
02:07:16.62 --> 02:07:24.30 it was a factor and so so you're saying we're not feeling like doing this and why you're
02:07:24.30 --> 02:07:29.34 seeing yeah like oh I got it I got to go to the post office today and that's on the low end and then
02:07:29.34 --> 02:07:34.94 or the other one is I don't know I get it I don't know something more important right but maybe
02:07:34.94 --> 02:07:40.38 I'll wait a wait till really the last minute or we know procrastination type stuff so you're getting
02:07:40.38 --> 02:07:46.38 into the here and now yeah and not feeling like it that means absolutely nothing something needs
02:07:46.38 --> 02:07:52.38 to be done and I don't feel like it and you know how like you have certain ideas already and then
02:07:52.38 --> 02:07:57.02 other ideas are introduced and then those ideas kind of mingle with your existing ideas and they
02:07:57.02 --> 02:08:03.42 formulate this whole new course of action right so the not feeling like it is no excuse that idea
02:08:03.42 --> 02:08:10.06 came in and so now like it morphed into this thing like me not feeling like it who guess what I'm
02:08:10.06 --> 02:08:15.18 going to do I'm going to do it right so it's almost like this personal challenge now you know and
02:08:15.18 --> 02:08:20.94 man as far as results go and you get everything done I get it so much stuff done and it's not
02:08:20.94 --> 02:08:26.06 some probably compared to you it's nothing but I get stuff done like so many things done during
02:08:26.06 --> 02:08:30.78 the day that I never thought that I could do that many things in a day that's all I'm always looking
02:08:30.78 --> 02:08:35.26 for maybe a rest or a nap or something like that but now everyone's all all be challenging myself
02:08:35.26 --> 02:08:41.10 to do as many things as I can and be like solid and on top of that and you're the one who said this
02:08:41.10 --> 02:08:46.30 was one time one of the things you were kind of tired and you were like you know what what I like
02:08:46.30 --> 02:08:50.70 this I like just grinding and grinding and grinding and then at the end of the day when I go
02:08:50.70 --> 02:08:55.10 it go to bed where my head just crashes into the pillow I like that and I was like yeah that sounds
02:08:55.10 --> 02:09:03.82 nice you know so when I approach things like that now and also I think of all the good things that have
02:09:03.82 --> 02:09:08.46 been done like great things and just good things whatever if these people didn't do it because they
02:09:08.46 --> 02:09:14.86 didn't feel like it like these things when they got done you know so if you got stuff to do
02:09:15.90 --> 02:09:21.74 you do it whether you feel like it or not that's what I have for myself now and the last thing
02:09:24.14 --> 02:09:30.22 is I kind of knew this but man it's so clear now that you can get certain messages and
02:09:30.22 --> 02:09:36.70 information and tips and tactics and stuff from from people or the internet or books or whatever
02:09:36.70 --> 02:09:44.22 but if you're not ready to accept them you just won't accept them or they'll just go in one
02:09:44.22 --> 02:09:47.66 year and out the other and a lot of time that has to do with who's saying it so
02:09:49.58 --> 02:09:54.22 if like I don't know your neighbor some goof off he's drinking a beer smoking a cigarette
02:09:54.22 --> 02:09:58.94 he's like hey guess what you know you should do this and it's that it can be this great advice
02:09:58.94 --> 02:10:02.46 being like I'm not going to listen to you I'm not even a listen to you I'm not even going to
02:10:02.46 --> 02:10:07.02 get past that part the fact that you're the one that saying this already walled me off from what
02:10:07.02 --> 02:10:13.98 you have to say and that's natural I think but a lot of these things like you're reading these old
02:10:13.98 --> 02:10:18.78 books that have these messages that you've been saying so it's not new stuff and a lot of stuff
02:10:18.78 --> 02:10:23.98 I heard that take responsibility for for your actions yeah that's not new you know if I
02:10:23.98 --> 02:10:28.62 bust out hey hey you guy on the street take responsibility for your actions if something comes
02:10:28.62 --> 02:10:33.02 up I'm just saying he'd be like yeah that's nothing new I wouldn't stand out but for some reason when
02:10:33.02 --> 02:10:40.14 you're saying it get you thinking yeah let me take responsibility you know so that so yeah it's say
02:10:41.66 --> 02:10:47.10 when it comes to listening to you this podcast all the you know the answers you have for these
02:10:47.10 --> 02:10:55.58 questions and any questions I even have it seems like it it comes and a process it way more readily
02:10:55.58 --> 02:11:04.46 than you know memes on Facebook or wherever you know say that that's awesome pretty true that's
02:11:04.46 --> 02:11:10.86 that's really cool that's that's great to hear and I've I mean I've definitely seen a transition
02:11:11.74 --> 02:11:18.94 in everything you're doing I mean everything you're doing is spot on yeah and that's legit you know
02:11:18.94 --> 02:11:26.06 it's legit to see it's legit to see someone moving towards their potential as a human yeah that's
02:11:26.06 --> 02:11:34.78 awesome to see yeah and another thing that kind of I came to as not a conclusion but it which is
02:11:34.78 --> 02:11:39.34 a result it's not a direct like you didn't tell me this but this is what all my existing thoughts
02:11:39.34 --> 02:11:46.46 mixed with all your input kind of arrived at one of the things is that it's up to you it's up to me
02:11:46.46 --> 02:11:55.90 what I spend my time doing totally up to me and it's up to me what I feel my head with so you know
02:11:55.90 --> 02:12:01.02 I like I used to have these shows that I love to I love to watch Hawaii 50 and Shark Tank and that's
02:12:01.02 --> 02:12:08.22 kind of it I don't really watch that much TV but those do that's maybe you know two hours or so
02:12:08.22 --> 02:12:13.10 that I could be reading something that's gonna help me through the rest of my life or getting better
02:12:13.10 --> 02:12:19.26 at something that's gonna help my you know relationships or career or something like that and I
02:12:19.26 --> 02:12:26.54 use that example because that seems pretty pretty like not in consequence because it's only two
02:12:26.54 --> 02:12:30.54 shows it's not like I spent 10 hours a day watching TV it's just two shows because no harm in that
02:12:30.54 --> 02:12:35.58 right but it's that's up to me I'm not missing out by missing Hawaii 50 not missing out that's not
02:12:35.58 --> 02:12:39.82 gonna affect my life in any negative way in the future at all I don't want to affect my life in
02:12:39.82 --> 02:12:47.18 any way actually but if I read something useful educate myself in you know whatever arena that's
02:12:47.18 --> 02:12:53.66 gonna improve my interests or my or my relationship or something like that that will that will help
02:12:53.66 --> 02:12:58.06 me yeah no I've that's one of the things I've noticed when I'd show show up at the studio
02:12:58.86 --> 02:13:03.90 and you'd say all's reading this book today about you know how we could get this to sound better
02:13:03.90 --> 02:13:07.90 and I read this thing about you know you're coming back and me with all this information
02:13:07.90 --> 02:13:14.38 and it was something that just transitioned in your brain where you said you know what I could be
02:13:14.38 --> 02:13:22.06 watching TV in wasting my mind or I could be applying myself and learning yeah and that's
02:13:23.02 --> 02:13:27.18 that makes a huge difference yeah this is what one of the things I read actually
02:13:28.62 --> 02:13:34.54 and I read it on I want to say Wikipedia this specific thing but there's this this automatic
02:13:34.54 --> 02:13:41.82 way of thinking and it's called hyperbolic discounting right and all that it all that means is
02:13:42.62 --> 02:13:46.70 you choose immediate payoffs versus and I kind of mentioned this before you choose immediate
02:13:46.70 --> 02:13:51.74 payoffs versus long-term payoffs right and it's there for a reason survival mechanism and all these
02:13:51.74 --> 02:13:58.14 ways but it's all that exists for an you know an environment that's not current so if you can
02:13:58.14 --> 02:14:04.38 basically be aware of that and combat that where don't do the immediate payoff things so
02:14:04.38 --> 02:14:08.94 just take take what you're about to do evaluated is this going to help me other than the pleasure
02:14:08.94 --> 02:14:17.42 that I think well whether that in regards to food drinking TV shows like if you watch reality TV
02:14:17.42 --> 02:14:24.06 check yourself on now and ask yourself is this going to help me in the future and typically
02:14:24.06 --> 02:14:29.66 that that answer for those types of things you're going to be know and then consider in alternative
02:14:29.66 --> 02:14:35.10 that you can do and a lot of the stuff can be pleasurable that will help you in the future and it's
02:14:35.10 --> 02:14:40.70 totally up to you it's totally up to you why not make the good choice yeah and the payoff not only
02:14:40.70 --> 02:14:46.86 is it bigger it lasts longer yeah and the immediate payoff is gone it's just a memory
02:14:48.46 --> 02:14:56.30 awesome that's awesome to hear and and actually we got that next comment here is sort of the same
02:14:56.30 --> 02:15:02.62 vein that's coming from and we get a bunch of you know emails but I just thought this one was
02:15:02.62 --> 02:15:08.22 was interesting to hear someone kind of talking about their transition here she says I'm one of
02:15:08.22 --> 02:15:15.90 many many people who live their lives as they think they should and end up mid 40s lost
02:15:15.90 --> 02:15:22.78 chubby and depressed I definitely don't hear a worship you but I'm truly grateful
02:15:22.78 --> 02:15:29.58 for your online presence I now get up at 5 a.m. daily and I screened grab my phone every morning
02:15:29.58 --> 02:15:34.62 as the alarm goes off and post that shot with another shot from my walk a few minutes in
02:15:35.42 --> 02:15:41.58 I walk for an hour daily and it started stretching daily for an hour but this doesn't stop there
02:15:41.58 --> 02:15:46.46 I now have a bunch of friends who are getting up early and going for a walk or going to the gym
02:15:46.46 --> 02:15:53.66 getting after it as you say we are all noticing an improvement in our lives so we might not be
02:15:53.66 --> 02:15:59.90 military or police we are not planning on becoming jiu jitsu champions at this stage we're just
02:15:59.90 --> 02:16:07.82 people who lost themselves lost their way who are finding their way back in part thanks to you
02:16:09.10 --> 02:16:14.06 I credit you at least twice a week and tell people to find you on Twitter I had to write here
02:16:14.06 --> 02:16:19.42 because there's no way I could fit this into 140 characters and thanks to Tim and Joe for having
02:16:19.42 --> 02:16:25.10 you on their shows that's where I found you have a great day so it really cool you know really cool
02:16:25.10 --> 02:16:32.46 to hear that really great to get that feedback and you know this is what I like about it
02:16:33.10 --> 02:16:36.86 but first of all you know I thank people who spread the words and it's really good to hear
02:16:36.86 --> 02:16:41.50 that feedback it fires me up to hear the feedback and when people say I motivate them I'm always
02:16:41.50 --> 02:16:47.10 like you motivate me you know that motivates me that you're out there getting up at 5 a.m.
02:16:47.10 --> 02:16:53.02 and turning your life around I think that's awesome and also what I what I liked about this
02:16:53.02 --> 02:16:58.22 was they pointed out that this isn't just military or police or jiu jitsu players it's for
02:16:58.22 --> 02:17:05.66 pretty much anybody in any station in life and any job any age man or woman any country and
02:17:05.66 --> 02:17:11.82 as a matter of fact I was in England and my wife from England and when I was in England I went and saw
02:17:11.82 --> 02:17:17.82 one of my wife's friends who I'm friends with the husband and you know here's this woman
02:17:19.34 --> 02:17:26.78 who's I don't know 40 something years old she's lives in England she's got three kids
02:17:28.06 --> 02:17:33.66 she's like couldn't be any further detached from me in my life
02:17:33.66 --> 02:17:39.10 and when I was I was hanging out with her husband in London before we went to their house
02:17:39.10 --> 02:17:43.42 and he said when we got on the train to go to his house he said listen you got to be ready
02:17:43.42 --> 02:17:49.98 and I'm like for what and he says my wife loves your podcast and I said really
02:17:49.98 --> 02:17:54.54 and he said no no no I'm serious she loves your podcast and we have dinner night she's going to
02:17:54.54 --> 02:17:58.54 ask you questions all my long she's been asking me the questions that she was going to ask you
02:17:58.54 --> 02:18:04.78 and so I showed up and seriously it was great she was asking me all these detailed questions about
02:18:04.78 --> 02:18:09.90 everything and it was really cool because I realized that this I mean this like I said this person
02:18:09.90 --> 02:18:15.90 doesn't do due to jitsu doesn't you know doesn't do anything that I do nothing
02:18:17.02 --> 02:18:21.82 and yet she was had all these lessons learned and all these things she had taken away and
02:18:21.82 --> 02:18:25.66 it was awesome to see that and it was an interesting too because that's I was talking to her
02:18:25.66 --> 02:18:32.38 it was on a Friday or a Saturday and as I'm talking to her she had listened to the latest podcast
02:18:32.94 --> 02:18:38.94 on the day before and so she was saying to me you know well yesterday you said this and yesterday
02:18:38.94 --> 02:18:45.74 you said that and so in her mind I was talking to her yesterday I was talking to her yesterday
02:18:45.74 --> 02:18:51.18 and that's when I kind of realized that how how impactful is what we talked about where you know
02:18:51.18 --> 02:18:55.42 where the words the podcast words are going directly into your brain and I've had a bunch of
02:18:55.42 --> 02:18:59.02 people say you know oh when you're talking oh you were telling this story and I wanted you to talk
02:18:59.02 --> 02:19:04.38 about this story you know for these are friends of mine and so so I think that's that's really cool
02:19:05.18 --> 02:19:10.70 and I think that's why a lot of people are getting into the game and enjoying it because and you
02:19:10.70 --> 02:19:16.70 just said it and I I say it all the time there's nothing new here and we're not
02:19:17.82 --> 02:19:23.90 given out any ground breaking techniques and there's no miracle drug and there's no three-minute
02:19:23.90 --> 02:19:34.30 exercise that's going to change your life I'm not selling the self-help reach your potential
02:19:35.18 --> 02:19:42.30 through this magical mystery I'm telling people what they already know and we're talking about
02:19:42.30 --> 02:19:48.46 things that people know to be right in their own heads like discipline and hard work and consistency
02:19:48.46 --> 02:19:58.14 those are the things and we all know those things but to everybody that's that's kind of
02:19:58.14 --> 02:20:04.54 known these things for a while but they've recently started to get after it good on you
02:20:05.66 --> 02:20:13.26 yeah and get on that path yeah if it feels like stay on that path that's what I'm talking about
02:20:13.26 --> 02:20:19.50 very cool I feel like like just like how you were saying like we a lot of this we already knew
02:20:19.50 --> 02:20:25.42 we already know about state discipline we already know about all this stuff or whatever but coming from
02:20:25.42 --> 02:20:34.62 you it helps and then on top of that I'm really starting to really understand and feel is that
02:20:34.62 --> 02:20:39.74 you know all like you on Twitter like you engage you know you like someone asks your questions
02:20:39.74 --> 02:20:46.46 it seems like you're engaging a lot more so than if somebody asks me question I'm going to answer
02:20:46.46 --> 02:20:51.50 their question yeah I'm not rude which is it I try to for sure I would imagine you'd be you know
02:20:51.50 --> 02:20:56.86 I have way more than me but kind of as a result of everything I feel like we're all kind of doing
02:20:56.86 --> 02:21:00.78 this together you know you know how the guys done in Australia they'll post all that you know
02:21:00.78 --> 02:21:06.14 a lot of people everyone they're posting there you know 430 a.m. wake up time to do this
02:21:06.14 --> 02:21:10.22 everyone yeah because that's what you did now guess what we're all doing it you know we're all doing
02:21:10.22 --> 02:21:14.62 it you're responding they're responding to you you're responding to them we're reading questions
02:21:14.62 --> 02:21:21.74 from them yeah I think I'm a weird like these are other people yeah and through this weird
02:21:22.62 --> 02:21:27.82 interweb they're actually asking questions from some unknown partner hold we're having a
02:21:27.82 --> 02:21:31.50 conversation basically yeah it's kind of delayed but yeah that's exactly what's going on so
02:21:31.50 --> 02:21:36.38 an example I should have just grabbed my phone and saw the half forget the guy's name but he was like
02:21:36.38 --> 02:21:42.46 hey echo Sunday workout Sunday this was like early this morning maybe late last night whatever
02:21:42.46 --> 02:21:48.78 Sunday workout give me one I need a Sunday workout so I was like oh okay so I gave him the workout it was
02:21:48.78 --> 02:21:58.06 basically two rounds five sets of cleaning clean and press five reps clean and press five times
02:21:58.06 --> 02:22:03.34 and then five burpees that's one set do five sets 45 seconds rest in between rest for two minutes
02:22:03.34 --> 02:22:09.10 and then do five more 45 seconds rest that's it I said use 135 pounds I only said 135 pounds because
02:22:09.10 --> 02:22:12.94 that's what that's the exact thing I do after I live and that's like to me that's the hard
02:22:12.94 --> 02:22:19.10 lifting side that hard but that part's kind of hard to me the metcon the metcon yeah so I'm like
02:22:19.10 --> 02:22:22.94 but I don't know maybe I don't know if I'm in good shape or not as far as that goes so I think
02:22:22.94 --> 02:22:29.66 I say you do it and use that weight but here's the thing if he's smaller I don't know how big he is
02:22:29.66 --> 02:22:33.82 we're just talking on Twitter you know so you know that put the weight didn't really matter
02:22:33.82 --> 02:22:38.54 hopefully scaled it properly or he said later on he was like dang that was pain but I feel great
02:22:38.54 --> 02:22:43.10 I was like solid he said hey but I adjusted the weight so I'm saying okay you know that makes sense
02:22:44.14 --> 02:22:51.02 but my two reasons why I was into that is because I wanted that interaction like hey do my work up
02:22:51.02 --> 02:22:54.46 you know and what I'm gonna do and I thought it was earlier this morning where
02:22:55.82 --> 02:23:01.50 or earlier today I'm gonna send him back say you give me a workout oh nice and I'm gonna do it
02:23:01.50 --> 02:23:05.58 and but make it something at least close to what you do or something you do and I'll give you
02:23:05.58 --> 02:23:10.54 your evaluation you know so hopefully I can get some variety and it'll help that interaction I think
02:23:10.54 --> 02:23:14.94 that's dope yeah like how he actually went and did it yeah I was like heck yeah it's good that
02:23:14.94 --> 02:23:24.78 some barn in Iowa or some yellow it was awesome good deal last question there must be some aspect
02:23:25.58 --> 02:23:30.46 of the Tutsi situation that I don't understand even if I'm on the losing side of the fight I still
02:23:30.46 --> 02:23:37.10 want to go down swing I could tell how much this affected jacco it would suck to be so close to such
02:23:37.10 --> 02:23:49.82 an unjust fight and not be able to do anything about it yes it it is hard to look at that situation
02:23:49.82 --> 02:23:59.90 and really understand it and it's horrible look back at it now and know that we didn't do anything about it
02:23:59.90 --> 02:24:10.06 but what can we do with it how can we apply this to everyday life because I agree with you
02:24:11.50 --> 02:24:19.82 you gotta go down swinging and I'll tell you this if you if you fight with all you've got
02:24:19.82 --> 02:24:34.06 more often than not you go down at all you win but you gotta make that attitude part of your
02:24:34.06 --> 02:24:43.90 everyday life the extra rep the extra mile the extra round the right choices to make yourself
02:24:43.90 --> 02:24:56.54 stronger mentally and physically stand and fight fight against weakness and against fear
02:24:57.50 --> 02:25:06.14 their fight against time and decay fight back go down swing it
02:25:06.14 --> 02:25:17.26 give every day everything you've got and when you face a challenge even something where you
02:25:17.26 --> 02:25:25.66 don't believe you can win maybe to situation where you cannot win but if you can't win
02:25:25.66 --> 02:25:39.26 remember this you have nothing to lose so stand up and go forward and go out in a blaze of glory
02:25:40.94 --> 02:25:48.46 fighting with everything you've got every ounce of energy every beat is sweat and every drop of blood
02:25:48.46 --> 02:26:04.38 to your last breath and then and only then you can stand down and you can put down your
02:26:04.38 --> 02:26:24.30 sword and you can put down your shield and rest in peace and I think that's all I've got for the
02:26:24.30 --> 02:26:32.86 night so thanks all you troopers out there tuning in and listening and thanks for remembering
