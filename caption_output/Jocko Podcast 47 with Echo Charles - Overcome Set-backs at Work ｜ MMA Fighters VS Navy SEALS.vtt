00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.74
This is Jockel Podcast number 47.

2
00:00:04.74 --> 00:00:08.80
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick.

3
00:00:08.80 --> 00:00:10.80
Good evening, I go.

4
00:00:10.80 --> 00:00:13.64
Good evening.

5
00:00:13.64 --> 00:00:18.40
And I went a little along with a couple of reviews.

6
00:00:18.40 --> 00:00:20.40
We've done some interviews.

7
00:00:20.40 --> 00:00:29.48
We interviewed JP De Nell and I got a ton of really solid books that I'm reading.

8
00:00:29.48 --> 00:00:33.20
I'm learning a lot from all of them.

9
00:00:33.20 --> 00:00:36.96
And just getting a lot out of those books that I'm reading about.

10
00:00:36.96 --> 00:00:37.96
War.

11
00:00:37.96 --> 00:00:44.24
And about leadership and about human nature and about life.

12
00:00:44.24 --> 00:00:51.68
But kind of failed to answer questions for the last few podcasts.

13
00:00:51.68 --> 00:00:54.68
Questions from the interwebs from everybody out there that's listening.

14
00:00:54.68 --> 00:00:56.04
And the question has been piling up.

15
00:00:56.04 --> 00:01:03.08
So tonight we're going to simply dive into some questions from you all out there.

16
00:01:03.08 --> 00:01:05.36
So let's get right to it.

17
00:01:05.36 --> 00:01:06.36
Echo Charles.

18
00:01:06.36 --> 00:01:09.08
If question number one.

19
00:01:09.08 --> 00:01:10.36
What has gotten?

20
00:01:10.36 --> 00:01:11.36
Jockel.

21
00:01:11.36 --> 00:01:17.04
Do you think that most MMA fighters have what it takes to be seals the mental and physical,

22
00:01:17.04 --> 00:01:21.52
the brutal wake cut, the brutal fight camp and stepping into a cage with a train and a

23
00:01:21.52 --> 00:01:22.72
lead opponent?

24
00:01:22.72 --> 00:01:29.52
Well, this is one of those questions where you might think there's like a really definitive

25
00:01:29.52 --> 00:01:31.80
answer.

26
00:01:31.80 --> 00:01:40.16
But there isn't really some MMA fighters could definitely be great seals for sure.

27
00:01:40.16 --> 00:01:42.96
Some of them actually wouldn't stand a chance.

28
00:01:42.96 --> 00:01:43.96
That seals.

29
00:01:43.96 --> 00:01:48.20
And there's a lot of things that make people quit and not want to be seals or quit during

30
00:01:48.20 --> 00:01:49.20
seal training.

31
00:01:49.20 --> 00:01:50.60
You know, you got the water.

32
00:01:50.60 --> 00:01:52.48
Some people don't like the water.

33
00:01:52.48 --> 00:01:55.08
Some people are uncomfortable in the water.

34
00:01:55.08 --> 00:01:57.76
Great athletes, not good in the water.

35
00:01:57.76 --> 00:02:01.68
Some people don't like the cold and they can understand and take all kinds of punishment

36
00:02:01.68 --> 00:02:03.36
of physical nature.

37
00:02:03.36 --> 00:02:05.88
But they don't like the cold.

38
00:02:05.88 --> 00:02:08.16
Some people don't like heights.

39
00:02:08.16 --> 00:02:13.48
You get to the top of a 40 or 50 foot cargo net and you've got to climb over that little

40
00:02:13.48 --> 00:02:15.68
pole at the top, get to the other side.

41
00:02:15.68 --> 00:02:17.16
Some people don't like that.

42
00:02:17.16 --> 00:02:19.84
Some people can't do some simple stuff like memorize.

43
00:02:19.84 --> 00:02:21.40
You can't memorize certain facts.

44
00:02:21.40 --> 00:02:27.44
There is an intellectual level that you have to have.

45
00:02:27.44 --> 00:02:30.16
Some people aren't situationally aware.

46
00:02:30.16 --> 00:02:33.04
So some of these like, for instance, you know, you have certain MMA fighters who are

47
00:02:33.04 --> 00:02:37.44
real wild and it's one of their good characteristics is that they're kind of out of control.

48
00:02:37.44 --> 00:02:40.84
They help some do wild things and fight unexpected things.

49
00:02:40.84 --> 00:02:45.72
You can't be like that in the kill house would go and live fire.

50
00:02:45.72 --> 00:02:47.000
You can't have that.

51
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.32
Why you need to be able to suppress that.

52
00:02:48.32 --> 00:02:49.32
Some people can't suppress that.

53
00:02:49.32 --> 00:02:53.88
So what you end up with someone is someone that's going to have safety issues because they're

54
00:02:53.88 --> 00:02:59.24
too instinctual and they can't get those instincts under control.

55
00:02:59.24 --> 00:03:03.28
Some people might have too much endurance but not enough strength.

56
00:03:03.28 --> 00:03:05.64
Some people might have too much strength and not enough endurance.

57
00:03:05.64 --> 00:03:08.08
Some people are injury prone.

58
00:03:08.08 --> 00:03:14.56
Some people are just injury prone and it's not their fault many cases, but they are.

59
00:03:14.56 --> 00:03:20.44
And then you take, so that's sort of the things that it takes to be in the seal teams

60
00:03:20.44 --> 00:03:25.52
that would could hold up or trip up somebody that's just standard MMA fighter.

61
00:03:25.52 --> 00:03:31.40
Now the same thing is true with seals that would be MMA fighters, right?

62
00:03:31.40 --> 00:03:33.80
Or could seal potentially be MMA fighters?

63
00:03:33.80 --> 00:03:40.16
And there's been a few seals that have fought really well and good fighters and all that.

64
00:03:40.16 --> 00:03:44.52
But to make a blanket statement, there's going to be things that trip people look.

65
00:03:44.52 --> 00:03:52.68
And for instance, some guys in the seal teams that they're not the best athlete, their athletic

66
00:03:52.68 --> 00:04:02.88
ability is not as high as it might need to be to be a true competitor in MMA.

67
00:04:02.88 --> 00:04:06.60
Whether that's they don't have the explosiveness or they don't have the coordination of the

68
00:04:06.60 --> 00:04:07.60
flexibility.

69
00:04:07.60 --> 00:04:10.04
There's something that's going to make them not competitive.

70
00:04:10.04 --> 00:04:13.76
And normally those guys, sometimes they might not be the best seals.

71
00:04:13.76 --> 00:04:16.88
But some of those guys are smart.

72
00:04:16.88 --> 00:04:20.16
And so the reason that they're good seals is because they're just they're just tactically

73
00:04:20.16 --> 00:04:22.40
sound in order to really good leaders.

74
00:04:22.40 --> 00:04:25.80
They're never going to beat people on the range shooting because they're just not that coordinated.

75
00:04:25.80 --> 00:04:28.000
I have the hand eye coordination.

76
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.08
But they're good seals anyways.

77
00:04:30.08 --> 00:04:35.80
But when you put them in a purely physical competition like MMA, I shouldn't say, most

78
00:04:35.80 --> 00:04:41.28
a more physical on physical competition like MMA, they're not going to do well.

79
00:04:41.28 --> 00:04:43.28
And of course, obviously there's a skill set, right?

80
00:04:43.28 --> 00:04:46.64
MMA fighters train MMA all the time.

81
00:04:46.64 --> 00:04:47.24
That's what they do.

82
00:04:47.24 --> 00:04:50.80
They train you just to a boxing and wrestling and mojtai and judo.

83
00:04:50.80 --> 00:04:53.16
That's what they do.

84
00:04:53.16 --> 00:04:54.80
And seals also train all the time.

85
00:04:54.80 --> 00:04:55.80
But guess what?

86
00:04:55.80 --> 00:05:02.04
When you're in a sealed team, you're not just training just fighting, right?

87
00:05:02.04 --> 00:05:05.56
You're training shooting and you're training tactics and you're training patrolling and

88
00:05:05.56 --> 00:05:11.04
land navigation and parachuteing and combat diving and fast-robing and repelling and water

89
00:05:11.04 --> 00:05:13.08
and born operations and all this stuff.

90
00:05:13.08 --> 00:05:16.80
And then on top of all that stuff, which is the stuff that you actually really need to

91
00:05:16.80 --> 00:05:22.40
train, then they put on a level of mixed martial arts training to make sure that if you are

92
00:05:22.40 --> 00:05:26.52
for whatever reason without a weapon or if you need to handle somebody that doesn't have

93
00:05:26.52 --> 00:05:31.20
a weapon and so therefore you might not be in the right to just shoot them and kill them.

94
00:05:31.20 --> 00:05:32.32
You've got to be able to handle yourself.

95
00:05:32.32 --> 00:05:39.04
So there's some level of MMA training, some fundamental judo skills, some fundamental striking

96
00:05:39.04 --> 00:05:45.96
skills, some fundamental wrestling skills that seals get but it's not at the level of

97
00:05:45.96 --> 00:05:48.12
what a real MMA fighters can have.

98
00:05:48.12 --> 00:05:57.000
So with all that, I think there's a good percentage of MMA fighters that would make it

99
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.96
through seal training and be good seals and there's a good number of seals that would

100
00:06:00.96 --> 00:06:05.64
probably make really good solid MMA fighters if they chose to do that and focus their lives

101
00:06:05.64 --> 00:06:08.84
on it because there are some common traits with both of them, both of them take hard

102
00:06:08.84 --> 00:06:15.84
work, both of them take some level of physical suffering, grind.

103
00:06:15.84 --> 00:06:20.28
Both, I mean, you've been around when we're running MMA camps for people, it's a grind.

104
00:06:20.28 --> 00:06:21.28
It's a grind.

105
00:06:21.28 --> 00:06:22.76
It's a day in the out grind.

106
00:06:22.76 --> 00:06:25.36
Now there's some luxury to that grind.

107
00:06:25.36 --> 00:06:29.52
There's some luxury to that grind because when you're in an MMA camp, yeah, you work hard

108
00:06:29.52 --> 00:06:35.52
as hell from seven in the morning till nine o'clock, doing your strength and conditioning.

109
00:06:35.52 --> 00:06:40.66
Then you're going to go home, get a massage and thinning your fat and a lot of gotten

110
00:06:40.66 --> 00:06:41.66
a good food that a lot.

111
00:06:41.66 --> 00:06:45.96
You're going to sit down and relax, and then at eleven o'clock and you're going again and

112
00:06:45.96 --> 00:06:52.48
you'll get your grappling training and you can train really hard for an hour or maybe

113
00:06:52.48 --> 00:06:56.28
an hour and a half to get through to схloids, getting whaton out, and then you're gonna

114
00:06:56.28 --> 00:07:03.08
go eat some munch, select relax, you're going to go back home and wait that to play

115
00:07:03.08 --> 00:07:07.92
So there's some luxury to the MMA in the SEAL teams. There's not that those

116
00:07:07.92 --> 00:07:12.88
It's not happening. You're just getting ground down when you're going through the basic training and when you're going through

117
00:07:13.08 --> 00:07:17.40
You know the advanced work-up training. You're you're just getting beat down all the time. It's it's a grind

118
00:07:18.40 --> 00:07:20.60
But both of them are agrind and

119
00:07:21.68 --> 00:07:26.40
That's why I think though the work ethic that comes with a really good seal or a really good MMA fighter

120
00:07:26.40 --> 00:07:30.08
There's a very strong similarity there and the ability to take that grind is

121
00:07:30.08 --> 00:07:36.48
Is what I think that that intrinsic discipline is what would make

122
00:07:37.04 --> 00:07:44.44
The crossover occur so that would make a seal into a good MMA fighter or an MMA fighter into a good seal or a good special operations guy

123
00:07:44.44 --> 00:07:47.84
Yeah, and in this I'm the crossover

124
00:07:48.48 --> 00:07:52.92
Ultimately just he says kind of hard to identify it overall this real general

125
00:07:52.92 --> 00:07:58.72
Because like an MMA fighter is training sure he's training to be a better MMA fighter in general, but

126
00:07:59.88 --> 00:08:03.64
Mainly is training for an event. So nose. Okay

127
00:08:04.04 --> 00:08:10.16
It's gonna be this many rounds. It's gonna be this long per round. I'm gonna get this much rest for this round and I'm training to win that

128
00:08:11.44 --> 00:08:14.44
Real specific so the training is

129
00:08:15.28 --> 00:08:20.52
If it's good training, it's gonna best train him to function in that event and give him a

130
00:08:20.52 --> 00:08:23.80
Paramount. Yeah combat maybe it's not like that

131
00:08:25.08 --> 00:08:31.32
You know a great example this is Tim Kennedy right Tim Kennedy's a green beret special forces guy and he's his complete beast

132
00:08:31.32 --> 00:08:32.92
You know and

133
00:08:32.92 --> 00:08:39.18
He's a great example of a guy that has the commitment to discipline the dedication to be a special forces guy

134
00:08:39.18 --> 00:08:44.88
And that translates right into how he works out and trains for fights. That guy trains like a madman for fights

135
00:08:44.88 --> 00:08:50.52
And I think that's a great example of somebody not only can do one to the other. He does both

136
00:08:50.52 --> 00:08:54.80
You know real time. He's in it. He's fighting November 15th right against Rashad evidence

137
00:08:55.52 --> 00:09:04.32
So good on him and I actually have like another follow-on question to this which is in the same arena

138
00:09:05.08 --> 00:09:12.52
Who would win yeah who would win and a fight between a UFC fighter and a seal team member

139
00:09:12.52 --> 00:09:17.40
And I'll just go ahead and broaden that out to make it like you know a special operation guy because

140
00:09:18.12 --> 00:09:20.12
People put special operations

141
00:09:21.44 --> 00:09:23.44
personnel onto a pedestal of

142
00:09:24.44 --> 00:09:27.96
You know totally being able to kick everyone's ass which is

143
00:09:29.88 --> 00:09:31.08
Well

144
00:09:31.08 --> 00:09:36.48
Did this to answer the question in its simplest form if the if there was a fight and

145
00:09:36.48 --> 00:09:43.68
It's mixed martial arts competition so like in a cage what you were just talking about with a referee and

146
00:09:44.88 --> 00:09:48.68
That's the way it's gonna be and there's five-minute rounds and there's five-five-minute rounds

147
00:09:48.68 --> 00:09:53.04
And we're gonna see who's gonna win this fight barring a massive weight difference

148
00:09:55.20 --> 00:09:57.20
and and

149
00:09:57.76 --> 00:09:59.20
a rare

150
00:09:59.20 --> 00:10:03.000
Special operations guy that has a high level of training

151
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.72
If you take 175 pound special operations guy

152
00:10:08.68 --> 00:10:12.52
That just trained like a normal special operation guy has doesn't have any specialties

153
00:10:12.52 --> 00:10:17.72
We're not talking Tim Kennedy. We're not talking to these guys that actually are committed and getting into it

154
00:10:18.36 --> 00:10:22.84
and trained outside the actual discipline of their job if it's just a normal run of the mill

155
00:10:23.56 --> 00:10:26.12
Guy from the special operations community a

156
00:10:26.76 --> 00:10:29.60
Game-state professional UFC fighter in the same weight class

157
00:10:29.60 --> 00:10:33.92
It's the UFC fighters gonna win

158
00:10:34.56 --> 00:10:36.56
That's those are the facts and

159
00:10:37.76 --> 00:10:40.96
Again, that's an occasion and I know this because you know what I've trained with a lot of

160
00:10:41.84 --> 00:10:48.56
Really high level UFC fighters and I mean I've trained with with Randy and T-Doh

161
00:10:48.56 --> 00:10:50.32
And I've trained with Brandon Verra and

162
00:10:50.80 --> 00:10:55.16
With Quentin rampage Jackson and I've trained with Dan Henderson and

163
00:10:55.16 --> 00:10:59.32
In my fact of training with bisming to stop trained with a lot of these guys, you know none of them

164
00:10:59.96 --> 00:11:03.48
At a like all the time all the brand of air and I used to try to get all the time

165
00:11:03.80 --> 00:11:04.80
but

166
00:11:04.80 --> 00:11:06.80
And he's awesome

167
00:11:06.80 --> 00:11:11.96
But I trained with those guys, you know, I trained with those guys and you know not to mention being being listed

168
00:11:11.96 --> 00:11:16.20
I've been trained with forever so I've trained and when I trained with those guys and majority of the time

169
00:11:16.20 --> 00:11:20.04
I would train grappling specific so

170
00:11:21.44 --> 00:11:23.72
We wouldn't be just doing straight MMA

171
00:11:23.72 --> 00:11:30.20
So we're training in an arena. That's geared towards me. You know some somewhere that I'm actually

172
00:11:31.32 --> 00:11:34.76
Good at right have been trained in just over 20 years and so

173
00:11:36.92 --> 00:11:41.56
When I go in the cage with those guys or when I've trained with those guys

174
00:11:41.56 --> 00:11:46.76
I'm competitive with them, you know, so you know, we have good training right? We're or it's not like

175
00:11:46.76 --> 00:11:49.72
Yeah, we have good training. It's good competitive training with all those guys

176
00:11:50.52 --> 00:11:52.52
But I've been training this stuff for a long time

177
00:11:52.52 --> 00:11:58.84
So my magical special operations powers they I know what they are and they're not real

178
00:12:00.44 --> 00:12:05.000
You're gonna you have to learn how to fight to be able to hang with these guys and if you don't know how to train if I put you know

179
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.52
Because I when I train with a regular, you know, got a seal that doesn't train of course

180
00:12:08.52 --> 00:12:11.56
You it's jujitsu you freaking destroy them. They have no chance

181
00:12:12.20 --> 00:12:13.16
So

182
00:12:13.16 --> 00:12:18.52
When if you take a guy that's just a normal guy that doesn't train they're gonna get their ass beat just like any other

183
00:12:18.52 --> 00:12:20.84
You need to get no magical powers. Will you be tough sure?

184
00:12:20.84 --> 00:12:25.16
Will it you know, and this is good like you know you take your average seal and you start teaching or jujitsu

185
00:12:25.16 --> 00:12:29.08
They're great training partners because they're strong they have great endurance they go freaking hard

186
00:12:29.08 --> 00:12:32.92
Yeah, they don't quit they don't give up they'll keep training with you until they don't tap easy

187
00:12:32.92 --> 00:12:36.76
So yeah, they're great training partners and the more you teach them the better they're gonna get and they're gonna learn

188
00:12:36.76 --> 00:12:39.16
Quickly because they're gonna be focused on it. So that's all good

189
00:12:39.72 --> 00:12:41.72
But the fact of matter is you take a skilled

190
00:12:42.52 --> 00:12:47.56
And I don't you know, you take a skilled UFC fighter and it doesn't matter that you were a quote unquote

191
00:12:47.56 --> 00:12:51.56
You know Navy seal or special operations guy that's

192
00:12:52.44 --> 00:12:56.04
That's just not gonna happen so

193
00:12:57.88 --> 00:13:00.84
Now the the other kind of thing on this is

194
00:13:02.36 --> 00:13:08.12
If you take both people now out of the cage and you put them into a

195
00:13:09.24 --> 00:13:13.40
Survival type situation now the the special operations person's gonna have a much better chance

196
00:13:13.40 --> 00:13:20.20
Because they're first of all they're gonna be all the they're gonna try and avoid the bad situation if they can and if they do

197
00:13:20.20 --> 00:13:23.96
Have the fight they are much more likely to use some kind of a

198
00:13:24.60 --> 00:13:31.40
Improvised weapon to do some kind of sneak attack to have back up right in the form of other guys that you didn't realize

199
00:13:31.40 --> 00:13:33.72
We're with him and all of a sudden you're getting hit in the head of the bottle

200
00:13:34.28 --> 00:13:38.20
It's the professional fighter of course has a huge advantage, but

201
00:13:39.24 --> 00:13:41.24
There will be there is some

202
00:13:41.24 --> 00:13:47.72
When you get out of the cage and there's no referee there's there's some things that you know your average special operations guys

203
00:13:47.72 --> 00:13:51.08
It's gonna be thinking about that your normal

204
00:13:51.64 --> 00:13:54.04
Person wouldn't be thinking about in these situations

205
00:13:55.40 --> 00:13:56.68
So

206
00:13:56.68 --> 00:14:02.76
You know that's why I said you know just in general first of all don't get any street fights. It's not smart doesn't get you anywhere

207
00:14:04.04 --> 00:14:09.32
And you see guys that are in the military just in general they kind of have a

208
00:14:09.32 --> 00:14:17.08
Another little level that they might take things to right and that's that's you know

209
00:14:17.08 --> 00:14:21.56
You think you're getting a little fist fight right you think all the I'm gonna bomb's gonna little fist fight with this person

210
00:14:21.56 --> 00:14:23.56
The next thing you know someone's biting off your nose

211
00:14:24.36 --> 00:14:31.08
Right or someone's ripping off your ear or someone's sticking to fork in your eye because that's the kind of thing like that's the kind of thing that

212
00:14:32.36 --> 00:14:36.20
You take one of these people who's trained and that has a little switch in their head that they go

213
00:14:36.20 --> 00:14:41.48
Oh, I'm gonna I'm gonna combat scenario right now with this guys attacking me and I'm gonna chew off as I'm gonna chew off his nose

214
00:14:41.48 --> 00:14:46.84
I'm gonna rip off his ear or I'm gonna gouge out his eyes. I'm gonna do it right now as fast as I can so that's why

215
00:14:47.72 --> 00:14:49.72
You know just

216
00:14:50.04 --> 00:14:54.60
You've got to use caution and I got actually one of my one of my buddies back in the day

217
00:14:56.12 --> 00:14:58.84
There was we were in a bar and

218
00:15:00.44 --> 00:15:03.24
Some guy was getting cocky and said something to a girl and

219
00:15:03.24 --> 00:15:09.72
And you know he knew the girl and blah blah blah and there was whatever situation so

220
00:15:10.84 --> 00:15:12.84
My buddies like hey

221
00:15:12.84 --> 00:15:19.62
Hey, can you go ahead and apologize that girl? You know because that wasn't cool. He said it all nice like yeah, like just all my yeah and the guys you know

222
00:15:20.76 --> 00:15:25.80
What he says he oh hey no no problem. I just you said something to the girl over there

223
00:15:25.80 --> 00:15:28.60
You see her yeah with the with the red shirt on yeah

224
00:15:28.60 --> 00:15:31.80
You said something to her and it was kind of offensive so if you could just go you know apologize to her then

225
00:15:31.80 --> 00:15:35.08
You know we're all good here and and it is what we mean we're all good

226
00:15:35.64 --> 00:15:39.16
No, I mean if you can just apologize to her then we're all good and

227
00:15:40.44 --> 00:15:42.44
You know the guy says something like

228
00:15:43.40 --> 00:15:47.40
You know what are you gonna do about and as he's finishing those words

229
00:15:48.12 --> 00:15:51.16
The guy was smoking a cigarette as he's finishing those words

230
00:15:52.04 --> 00:15:58.04
My buddy in a millisecond in a nano second like faster than you can snap your fingers

231
00:15:58.04 --> 00:16:02.04
He snatches the cigarette out of the guy's mouth and shoves it with

232
00:16:02.60 --> 00:16:08.36
Absolute laser target precision up the guys knows a burning cigarette

233
00:16:09.56 --> 00:16:15.24
So this dude just and he put it you put in their deep. I don't even know how he did it

234
00:16:15.56 --> 00:16:18.20
Like a ninja move. Oh, it's up there

235
00:16:18.52 --> 00:16:22.36
The dude collapses. I mean can you imagine?

236
00:16:22.36 --> 00:16:27.000
You know, I mean you've seen people like put a cigarette out on the wrong or whatever leaves a scar for the rest of the life

237
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.88
Yeah, he shoved the cigarette the burning cigarette up the guys knows the guy collapses to the ground and just like screaming and

238
00:16:34.12 --> 00:16:37.000
I mean just completely defenseless so that's the kind of thing

239
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.08
Maybe that guy was a tough guy maybe that guy was thinking oh, I'm a boxer or

240
00:16:41.88 --> 00:16:47.000
Whatever this guy might have been I don't even know because the fight was over before it even started because the guy had a burning cigarette

241
00:16:47.16 --> 00:16:51.56
Jammed up in his nasal cavity in a split second fights over

242
00:16:51.88 --> 00:16:53.88
That's the kind of thing

243
00:16:53.88 --> 00:16:58.36
That let's be friends with each other. Let's just try and treat each other with respect out there

244
00:16:58.36 --> 00:17:03.16
So we're not get into fights because I got a bunch of stories like that and they don't end well

245
00:17:03.48 --> 00:17:05.48
You know they don't end well and

246
00:17:06.92 --> 00:17:08.92
Yeah, that's kind of like

247
00:17:10.20 --> 00:17:17.72
Like special operations guys that's kind of and I'm not that guy that you're talking about special operations guy right

248
00:17:17.72 --> 00:17:21.24
That's just those just the guy that did they were up the nose. Oh, no

249
00:17:21.24 --> 00:17:25.24
He's a seal oh yeah, he went this was this was years ago

250
00:17:25.96 --> 00:17:31.72
Many many years ago and yeah, he did it just like that and that's the kind of thing like again the guy that he's talking to

251
00:17:31.72 --> 00:17:35.88
Things he's a tough guy. Yeah, things. Oh, I'm a tough guy who else is what's this little

252
00:17:36.28 --> 00:17:40.44
You know guy talking to me talking smack telling me apologize. I don't have to apologize anybody

253
00:17:40.76 --> 00:17:45.24
And this was also pre MMA days, but you know maybe the guys are boxer maybe the guys are wrestler

254
00:17:45.24 --> 00:17:46.76
He may maybe it might be a tough guy

255
00:17:46.76 --> 00:17:52.60
But I guess apparently when you get a burning cigarette shoved up your nose. You're not tough anymore. Just goes over like that

256
00:17:52.60 --> 00:17:55.64
Yeah, even I mean even better then as an example, he's where

257
00:17:56.84 --> 00:18:00.84
First off if they guy you know how you how he said he's saying it all calm like I just go and apologize

258
00:18:00.84 --> 00:18:04.92
That would have made me nervous right there like oh this guy's too anyway, but that's the side thing so

259
00:18:06.12 --> 00:18:07.96
Like yeah, so a special operations guy

260
00:18:08.60 --> 00:18:12.36
Compared to MMA guy. He's he's about every he's thinking beyond the fight

261
00:18:12.36 --> 00:18:15.56
You think you straight up. This is a battle. So how can I win this book?

262
00:18:15.56 --> 00:18:22.04
War you know MMA fighter is thinking like when we fight yeah, how am I gonna beat you up with all my skills and you will

263
00:18:22.44 --> 00:18:25.96
Typically you will yeah, unless you have equal or better skills you're gonna get beat up

264
00:18:25.96 --> 00:18:27.96
You're gonna get it up fight. Yeah, so

265
00:18:28.12 --> 00:18:31.80
But the tactic like the other guy. He's thinking tactical. He's thinking okay, you know

266
00:18:31.80 --> 00:18:35.96
He'll probably and according to the guys that I hang around with when they walk in a room

267
00:18:36.12 --> 00:18:37.96
Just like a duet to guy when you when you when you

268
00:18:38.60 --> 00:18:44.12
One of a person is presented to you. You're thinking you did to already you're thinking okay from here

269
00:18:44.12 --> 00:18:49.08
Solid take down would come a special operation right guys thinking I could sick my pen in this guys. I really pan

270
00:18:49.08 --> 00:18:53.32
There's the door and you know that you know, let's say let's say other guys just came in

271
00:18:53.32 --> 00:18:58.52
Okay, so I got five guys he has like eight before any fight no fight no nothing. This is just the way

272
00:18:58.52 --> 00:19:04.76
You know the way that kind of the mine works and then so yeah if and he's planning like the you're guy

273
00:19:04.84 --> 00:19:06.84
He had that planner any you know

274
00:19:06.84 --> 00:19:09.88
It's not like he was like oh I'm just gonna attack and that just kind of came about

275
00:19:09.88 --> 00:19:14.76
Being during the process of attacking new like okay he has cigarette that's part of my plan my tactic, you know

276
00:19:15.56 --> 00:19:21.72
So yeah when you go outside it's just a fight no too like you think about you know the

277
00:19:22.20 --> 00:19:25.56
Applegate wrecks apagate the whole idea of of

278
00:19:26.60 --> 00:19:32.84
Self defense being close motor movements instead of fine motor movements so if you ever look at some of the old school

279
00:19:35.32 --> 00:19:37.72
Unarmed combat from the military

280
00:19:37.72 --> 00:19:43.24
It's all based on this idea that when you get in a fight you want to do these big gross motor skills

281
00:19:43.24 --> 00:19:46.68
In other words just giant movements with your fist and with your legs

282
00:19:46.68 --> 00:19:50.76
So there's no really fine motor skills because when your adrenaline's pumping in your in this fight

283
00:19:50.76 --> 00:19:56.24
You're gonna make little mistakes imagine the fine motor skills it takes to grab a cigarette and shove it up someone's nose in a split second

284
00:19:56.24 --> 00:20:03.72
No, yeah, you know, there's another story and I don't know why Tim Tim Kennedy and I we talked about it before we came on the podcast

285
00:20:03.72 --> 00:20:09.24
And we didn't get to it. Maybe we'll talk about it next time because we review the whole story. It's a great story

286
00:20:10.20 --> 00:20:14.68
As you know he trained at the pit in San Luis Obispo for a while and

287
00:20:15.72 --> 00:20:18.12
Seals used to do training up there and

288
00:20:19.16 --> 00:20:22.60
one night and all the guys that trained with Tim at the time

289
00:20:23.56 --> 00:20:26.04
They all used to work as bouncer and these guys are pro you

290
00:20:27.16 --> 00:20:31.80
Say I wish I could remember the names of the crew, but it's basically the old school

291
00:20:31.80 --> 00:20:38.52
San Luis Obispo pit crew right so it's gonna say again McGee Tim Kennedy chuckle a bell that

292
00:20:38.92 --> 00:20:45.08
crew right those guys before you know the UFC was big those guys all worked as bouncer in San Luis Obispo

293
00:20:45.64 --> 00:20:49.80
So some seals were doing some training up in the area they went out and down

294
00:20:50.52 --> 00:20:57.32
Got into a fight and they the the guys got their ass good as seals got their ass kicked pretty much by and and it was you know

295
00:20:57.32 --> 00:20:59.16
Tim and I were laughing about it because again

296
00:20:59.16 --> 00:21:05.96
This is before the UFC was really popular and they got do a fight and of course not only is it a bunch of

297
00:21:06.52 --> 00:21:11.88
UFC or at least high level MMA guys that are working as bouncer so they're sober

298
00:21:12.60 --> 00:21:18.68
Fighting against a bunch of drunk team guys and it was funny because I they said you know because these seals got their ass

299
00:21:18.68 --> 00:21:24.36
As kicked and they're kind of like came back like oh man or these bouncer's were tough and then I go

300
00:21:24.36 --> 00:21:29.000
What where was it and they're like San Luis Obispo and then somehow through the grapevine through the MMA grapevine

301
00:21:29.08 --> 00:21:35.96
There somebody told me back hey, jockel those guys that got it was these guys from the pit yeah, I was like oh, okay

302
00:21:35.96 --> 00:21:37.96
I know that story by the way because

303
00:21:37.96 --> 00:21:42.60
What a guy he was a new guy. He was yeah, I'm not saying yeah, I think he's still in yeah, I'm saying it's name, but he

304
00:21:43.48 --> 00:21:47.72
Man, I'm doing the cake nuts, you know they come by and all the that's how I met J. Pete kind of the same way

305
00:21:47.72 --> 00:21:53.08
Yeah, but um and but he would always come in the club that I worked at and so we kind of became friends, you know

306
00:21:53.08 --> 00:21:57.72
So after we're done we're eating at the same spot. Yeah, he's like yeah, man for chuckle it

307
00:21:57.72 --> 00:21:59.72
El beat me. Yeah

308
00:21:59.72 --> 00:22:03.48
Like we're you know beat him down, but we got in a fight and chuckle it El beat me

309
00:22:03.48 --> 00:22:08.04
You know like hit him and you've come down and I actually yeah, that's what happened

310
00:22:08.36 --> 00:22:13.000
So that was a classic example and by the way, you know, I'll say something about while we're talking about chuckle it

311
00:22:13.96 --> 00:22:19.56
Chuck when Chuck's always been like awesome to vets especially wounded vets so chuckle Dell

312
00:22:19.56 --> 00:22:25.48
Hey, if he's bouncing at a bar and you're a vet and you get out of line you're gonna get you're gonna get put down

313
00:22:25.48 --> 00:22:27.48
But if you're a if you're a warrior

314
00:22:27.96 --> 00:22:33.56
That always impressed me about Chuck was he he did some great stuff for the for the troops have been wounded overseas and then always

315
00:22:34.76 --> 00:22:38.84
Give me a lot of respect for him, you know even more respect than I have for him is being a great fighter

316
00:22:38.84 --> 00:22:45.48
But anyways that kind of answers the question and so my overall broad

317
00:22:46.20 --> 00:22:48.20
guidance here is

318
00:22:48.20 --> 00:22:52.20
Train hard to do battle but do your battles in the gym not in the street

319
00:22:52.92 --> 00:22:57.56
Yeah, it's only gonna get you either put in jail or put in the hospital or both

320
00:22:58.36 --> 00:23:00.36
So

321
00:23:00.04 --> 00:23:03.56
Yeah, remember this guy we trained with got his ear bit off remember

322
00:23:03.80 --> 00:23:05.56
Yeah, Igor with you

323
00:23:05.56 --> 00:23:11.72
Yeah, what's he a Navy Silver is he he he got out? Yes, yes, yeah, he got into a street fight

324
00:23:12.28 --> 00:23:16.52
Yeah, and I mean he he he he kicked the guys ass, right?

325
00:23:16.52 --> 00:23:21.08
He actually I think he more tyklens than put him down the ground got cross side yeah was

326
00:23:21.64 --> 00:23:26.60
Kind of putting the put in the beat down on this guy and the dude just bit big chunk was it big

327
00:23:26.60 --> 00:23:30.04
A chunk of his ear right bigger than the chunk that

328
00:23:31.32 --> 00:23:35.000
Bigger than chunk that Mike Tyson did out. I mean he was a big chunk. I mean he's his ears

329
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.96
Clearly has a bite taken out of it like if you took a bite a big nice solid bite out of a piece of pizza

330
00:23:40.92 --> 00:23:42.20
That's what his ear looks like

331
00:23:42.20 --> 00:23:45.40
No, and you know, oh cool. You won the fight

332
00:23:45.40 --> 00:23:47.08
Yeah, but you have no ear left

333
00:23:47.08 --> 00:23:50.44
So that's a bummer and that's another thing that's another point to that

334
00:23:51.08 --> 00:23:52.36
Is that

335
00:23:52.36 --> 00:23:54.36
Sometimes these self defense type people

336
00:23:55.24 --> 00:24:00.84
Good think that you know, oh well, I'll go dries out and that's the indication that I just kind of gave to that

337
00:24:00.84 --> 00:24:06.52
Hey, the Navy seal Mike do something tricky to you well the bottom line is that stuff is a lot of times doesn't work

338
00:24:06.52 --> 00:24:10.28
And then that's a perfect case the guy bit is you're often things. Oh the guys gonna give up no

339
00:24:10.28 --> 00:24:12.52
It's not given up he beat that means he wouldn't even harbor

340
00:24:12.52 --> 00:24:18.60
Well, like that means oh now you got a guy across the side that's about to ruin your shoulder for the rest of your life of the community or then put you sleeping

341
00:24:19.24 --> 00:24:23.40
Yeah, it's just a bad situation so you can't just another thing about those

342
00:24:23.88 --> 00:24:24.68
Those

343
00:24:24.68 --> 00:24:31.72
Thinking that you don't need to train because you're gonna do an engine mover. You're gonna shove a cigarette at some guys knows no wrong answer or you're gonna bite the rear off

344
00:24:31.72 --> 00:24:37.000
And you're gonna know that's not it's not true. You need to train so that you can get in those positions

345
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.64
And that you won't lose these fights and also you need to train so you don't have to get in fights

346
00:24:41.64 --> 00:24:44.84
Because most of the time when you're getting the fights because your ego's getting out of control and you can't

347
00:24:44.84 --> 00:24:51.000
You can't handle it in your little brain you get all yeah get all insecure about who you are as a man

348
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.84
So you think I'm gonna kick this guy's ass and then you're either getting your ass kicked

349
00:24:55.08 --> 00:24:59.96
You're getting put in the hospital or you're going to jail or you got a big lawsuit against you so

350
00:25:00.84 --> 00:25:02.84
Be smart

351
00:25:03.56 --> 00:25:06.28
Hey remember I'm blood support when he was like

352
00:25:06.28 --> 00:25:11.72
You know the coin you watch below remember blessed that the guy with a coin and he's like hey

353
00:25:12.44 --> 00:25:17.88
You know whatever I'm gonna if I can grab it before you close your hand and the girl had something to do with it

354
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.24
He grabs it he closed in he's like, oh, you know, I still feel the coin in my hand kind of thing

355
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.84
He looks he switched the coin that's kind of what your friend did with a cigarette when he shoved it in the guy's sinus cavity

356
00:25:32.84 --> 00:25:38.20
Because it's like super fast, you know, but precise, but you can't count on that move

357
00:25:39.16 --> 00:25:41.16
That's my point. No, all right

358
00:25:42.20 --> 00:25:43.88
Kick it off

359
00:25:43.88 --> 00:25:45.56
Let's go to question number two

360
00:25:46.92 --> 00:25:53.56
Jockel what if I don't have time to explain the why to my troops for a decision I'm making during an operation

361
00:25:54.20 --> 00:25:56.20
U.S. Army first lieutenant so

362
00:25:57.40 --> 00:26:00.60
Awesome thanks for your service U.S. Army first lieutenant get some

363
00:26:00.60 --> 00:26:02.60
and

364
00:26:02.60 --> 00:26:03.60
I

365
00:26:03.60 --> 00:26:05.60
Talk about

366
00:26:05.80 --> 00:26:12.28
Troops and people in general never wanting a plan to be

367
00:26:13.32 --> 00:26:17.56
In post upon them and so that's that's what this question is kind of based around because I'm gonna send it up

368
00:26:17.56 --> 00:26:20.76
You know, you don't want to just force people to do some plan you want to say hey

369
00:26:20.76 --> 00:26:24.68
What do you think you should do and hey here's here's what we're doing and here's why we're doing it

370
00:26:24.68 --> 00:26:28.84
This is why it's important that gets people to take ownership of it and therefore they do a better job

371
00:26:28.84 --> 00:26:33.000
So he must have heard me say that now he's saying look sometimes I ain't got time to be

372
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.12
to be explained in the why when we're getting this going on and that's why this idea of explaining the why is

373
00:26:38.68 --> 00:26:45.48
To 99% of the time in an administrative situation in a situation where things are in a control

374
00:26:45.48 --> 00:26:47.48
We've got time to think about what's happening

375
00:26:47.72 --> 00:26:52.12
That's when you can go and say hey, what's your what you you know what do you think how do you think we should do this

376
00:26:52.12 --> 00:26:59.08
This is why I want to accomplish this. This is the commanders intent you can do it all that stuff and that makes sense again in a

377
00:26:59.96 --> 00:27:09.28
Administrative situation when there's chaos and when there's mayhem and when there's uncertainty actually the opposite is true

378
00:27:11.56 --> 00:27:14.28
You actually want your troops to

379
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.08
You that they want they want to see and

380
00:27:20.08 --> 00:27:21.76
hear

381
00:27:21.76 --> 00:27:28.32
Clear directives from you they want to know what they should do in no one certain terms and it's

382
00:27:28.88 --> 00:27:36.40
You can think of situations where if you've seen let's say a car accident right and you see people that are kind of frazzled

383
00:27:36.48 --> 00:27:40.84
If someone steps up into that situation don't want to do anything that they're supposed to be doing if someone says

384
00:27:40.84 --> 00:27:45.12
Stop someone says you too start dragging that person over there you go call 911

385
00:27:45.12 --> 00:27:49.12
They actually teach that you know when you when you're learning about how to handle

386
00:27:49.12 --> 00:27:56.68
Traumatic situations somebody needs to step up step back take charge of the situation everybody wants that to happen and that's true

387
00:27:57.24 --> 00:27:58.24
in a

388
00:27:58.72 --> 00:28:02.68
Combat scenario again. This is different from when we're in the rear and we're we're

389
00:28:03.12 --> 00:28:08.92
Formulating a plan and we're safely going over whatever ideas we have and that's when you want to get impot input and feedback

390
00:28:09.64 --> 00:28:13.48
And you let your subordinate leadership come up with a plan. That's all good

391
00:28:13.48 --> 00:28:19.08
But that's not true during a like I said during a pressure situation when there's a

392
00:28:19.96 --> 00:28:25.08
Critical scenario unfolding people want to be led now

393
00:28:25.60 --> 00:28:32.12
When you lead them in those situations you can still give orders by commanders intent

394
00:28:32.20 --> 00:28:37.92
You can still just give intent so an example that and actually wrote my example down you can say like

395
00:28:38.56 --> 00:28:41.32
Delta one six we need high ground on the other side of that road make it happen

396
00:28:41.32 --> 00:28:46.48
So then the Delta one six commander goes okay. I need high ground on the other side of the road

397
00:28:46.48 --> 00:28:49.36
There's a good building looks like that's when we could take hey, you know

398
00:28:49.60 --> 00:28:54.44
Squat come with me and they go over and take down the building. I gave them a still gave them commanders intent

399
00:28:54.44 --> 00:28:58.08
I gave them very clear commanders intent. I didn't really tell them why I

400
00:28:58.48 --> 00:29:01.72
Didn't say hey, what do you think would be best? Do you think it's a good idea to get high ground? No?

401
00:29:01.72 --> 00:29:05.48
I said go get high ground on the other side of the street. That's what I told them to do

402
00:29:05.48 --> 00:29:10.84
So I'm gonna let them figure out they understand what the intent is you could say something a little bit more specific

403
00:29:11.48 --> 00:29:13.48
You could give them an actual

404
00:29:14.20 --> 00:29:16.52
An actual directive you could say

405
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.96
Charlie one six gig take two squads assault building 34 on the other side of the road get high ground on the rooftop go

406
00:29:24.20 --> 00:29:26.20
Now we have something it's more specific

407
00:29:26.92 --> 00:29:32.000
Again, it's not commanders intent. It's directly. I'm telling you what to do and a lot of times people gonna want that

408
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.84
They're gonna want to hear exactly what to do in these presses situations

409
00:29:34.84 --> 00:29:36.84
So depending on the level of

410
00:29:37.72 --> 00:29:46.44
Experience that your subordinate leadership has depends on maybe how specific you're gonna get with just given commanders intent versus giving something very specific to do

411
00:29:46.56 --> 00:29:51.86
Both of those are the right answers if you have a good really good leader underneath you and you can just give him the intent

412
00:29:51.86 --> 00:29:56.72
And even let them come up with the plant cool go with that if you got somebody that needs a little more guidance give them a little bit more specific guidance

413
00:29:59.08 --> 00:30:03.40
Now obviously one part of that is you got to have trust

414
00:30:03.40 --> 00:30:09.56
You got to have trust with the with the subordinate leadership with that you're working with whether that's you working with your whole

415
00:30:09.56 --> 00:30:13.32
Poutine and you just got to trust your your squad leaders and your your fire team leaders

416
00:30:13.72 --> 00:30:15.72
But you got to build that trust through

417
00:30:16.84 --> 00:30:18.84
through training and through

418
00:30:20.12 --> 00:30:23.48
Hard training through coaching them and mentoring and again

419
00:30:23.48 --> 00:30:28.60
Again, I hate using the word coaching and mentoring because that always gives an air of superiority

420
00:30:28.60 --> 00:30:32.68
And I'm not gonna want to come off across as superior to other people

421
00:30:32.68 --> 00:30:36.28
Hmm, well, why do I not want to come off as superior to other people?

422
00:30:37.40 --> 00:30:39.48
Well number one because it it

423
00:30:40.04 --> 00:30:43.000
Unifies our team more and number two because I'm not superior to other people

424
00:30:43.16 --> 00:30:48.32
Right, I'm another person and my subordinates even though they might not have as much time and rank or

425
00:30:48.60 --> 00:30:53.32
Experiences me they still might have great ideas and I respect that so this isn't a

426
00:30:54.12 --> 00:30:58.52
Hey, I don't want to use coach or mentor because I'm manipulating them and I want to make sure that they

427
00:30:58.52 --> 00:31:03.000
That they listen to me because I'm being a certain way with them. No. No. I legitimately

428
00:31:04.04 --> 00:31:07.16
Respect what they're saying. That's the difference here. So

429
00:31:07.72 --> 00:31:13.48
But that's but my goal is to build trust and the other way that you build trust and I've said this before is my giving trust

430
00:31:13.56 --> 00:31:17.000
You know hey, I trust that you can do this. Hey echo you're gonna go take down the building

431
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.20
I trust your playing come up with it make it happen boom you could do it you trust me more when I trust you

432
00:31:22.20 --> 00:31:24.20
You trust me and that's what we want to do

433
00:31:24.20 --> 00:31:28.20
Now when the operation is over and

434
00:31:28.76 --> 00:31:36.92
And now you're in a post operational debrief then you can discuss why you gave a certain order or you can get feedback from them on a why they

435
00:31:37.16 --> 00:31:42.52
Executed a certain way and you can get the questions going back and forth and through that little question and answer

436
00:31:43.24 --> 00:31:47.24
Period that takes place during a post operational debrief. We get to know each other more

437
00:31:47.56 --> 00:31:50.36
We build more trust and we become better as a team

438
00:31:52.04 --> 00:31:54.04
So that's the way it works

439
00:31:54.04 --> 00:31:58.68
You don't always have time to explain why pressure situations you lead

440
00:32:01.72 --> 00:32:03.72
That trust thing is big

441
00:32:07.96 --> 00:32:12.04
Next question next question. I like it where we got

442
00:32:13.24 --> 00:32:17.96
What advice do you have for those who have weak poor or otherwise ineffective leaders?

443
00:32:18.60 --> 00:32:20.92
How do you manipulate that situation?

444
00:32:20.92 --> 00:32:27.32
Hmm so again I think I may have actually answered this question before

445
00:32:29.24 --> 00:32:31.24
But I'll answer to get sure

446
00:32:34.68 --> 00:32:36.68
When

447
00:32:37.40 --> 00:32:43.000
When you are in a situation like this when you got somebody that's weak or ineffective leader or a poor leader

448
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.72
The answer is always the same which usually lead

449
00:32:45.72 --> 00:32:50.76
You lead yourself and I hope people that listen to podcast all in the regular

450
00:32:52.20 --> 00:32:56.76
You all knew what I was gonna say there you all know that when

451
00:32:57.72 --> 00:33:00.52
Someone is not leading you

452
00:33:01.32 --> 00:33:04.84
Then you lead them you pick up the slack for the weakness

453
00:33:05.48 --> 00:33:08.28
My leaders want to come up with a plan cool. I will

454
00:33:09.32 --> 00:33:11.72
My leader doesn't want to give a brief. That's fine. I will

455
00:33:11.72 --> 00:33:18.28
My leader doesn't want to mentor the younger troops. That's okay. I will do it

456
00:33:19.80 --> 00:33:26.20
Leaders doesn't want to take the blame when something goes wrong. That's fine with me. I'm gonna take the blame

457
00:33:27.72 --> 00:33:32.28
And you think about that one that one can be tricky because you think we're home and look bad in front of the

458
00:33:32.28 --> 00:33:36.60
In front of the more senior boss. Now think about it from the senior boss's position

459
00:33:36.60 --> 00:33:44.44
If if you work for me echo and the boss comes in and we the mission was a failure and I'm the I'm the guy that's in charge

460
00:33:45.80 --> 00:33:48.84
And I say sorry boss we failed it was echo as fault

461
00:33:49.72 --> 00:33:54.44
And echo goes hey sir, it was my fault. Here's what happened here's the mistakes I made and here's what I'm gonna do to fix it next time

462
00:33:54.44 --> 00:33:59.08
Who do you respect more? Yeah, of course. I'm looking to promote you. You know I actually want to promote you

463
00:33:59.08 --> 00:34:03.96
You want to fire myself for being a guy that's passing the buck and passing a responsibility or not taking ownership of anything

464
00:34:03.96 --> 00:34:11.000
So imagine what that looks like before you get all intimidated by taking the blame for something and think you're gonna look bad and think you're gonna get fired

465
00:34:11.56 --> 00:34:16.76
Think about what it looks like from the senior perspective and you actually have to imagine what it will look like

466
00:34:17.08 --> 00:34:22.84
Underneath you you have to see it from your perspective because it's even when you think about their perspective

467
00:34:23.16 --> 00:34:27.80
You still can be in fear of it. You think oh I'm the guy that's taking the blame. I'm the one that's gonna get fired

468
00:34:28.68 --> 00:34:32.20
No and and am I saying this like blanket

469
00:34:32.20 --> 00:34:37.72
That there's sometimes where if the boss screws something up really bad like let's say it was something like classified

470
00:34:37.88 --> 00:34:44.40
Information got left out and it was your boss that literally left it out and you go no it was me

471
00:34:44.40 --> 00:34:49.32
Well first of all you're not telling the truth right so you're not telling the truth and the person made a mistake

472
00:34:49.32 --> 00:34:53.96
That's and that there's no excuse for you so that's not a situation that I'm talking about and

473
00:34:55.24 --> 00:34:59.56
If your boss was the type of person that said yes, I'm gonna put the blame on him

474
00:34:59.56 --> 00:35:04.20
I would burn them alive like actually here's what really happened so

475
00:35:05.88 --> 00:35:07.64
I'm not talking about that type of situation

476
00:35:07.64 --> 00:35:14.92
But when you're doing an operational thing where there's mistakes it get made and your boss is scared to take ownership of them take ownership of

477
00:35:15.88 --> 00:35:18.52
Not that it you will win in the long run

478
00:35:20.44 --> 00:35:23.44
Now here's the part that is

479
00:35:23.44 --> 00:35:31.36
Crucial and critical and the most challenging part of this and that is when you step up and lead

480
00:35:31.76 --> 00:35:36.24
You want to make sure you aren't stepping up and stepping on

481
00:35:37.44 --> 00:35:43.48
Your leader you don't want to step into their little spotlight you don't want to

482
00:35:44.80 --> 00:35:47.28
Impose yourself in their

483
00:35:47.28 --> 00:35:53.60
Leadership line light and glory you don't want to do that you you can't do that

484
00:35:54.08 --> 00:36:00.24
You want them to get the credit you don't want to have them be intimidated by you in any way and this is hard

485
00:36:01.28 --> 00:36:03.44
Because when you start taking ownership for stuff

486
00:36:04.08 --> 00:36:06.08
It's very it can be very

487
00:36:07.44 --> 00:36:12.64
Intimidating for the person that's above you because they think dang this guy just he's just a bold bastard

488
00:36:12.64 --> 00:36:20.56
Then stepping up and taking charge of stuff and they might get intimidated that so so what you have to do is you have to do some some indirect

489
00:36:21.20 --> 00:36:23.20
Manuver warfare here and

490
00:36:23.36 --> 00:36:25.20
For instance if they don't

491
00:36:25.20 --> 00:36:30.16
Want to if they don't want to come up with a plan maybe you start saying hey sir, what do you think of this would this be a good plan and

492
00:36:32.16 --> 00:36:36.40
Maybe if you're if they're not mentoring the younger guys maybe say hey, you know what I want to do this

493
00:36:36.40 --> 00:36:38.48
I want to spend some time with the guys after work

494
00:36:38.48 --> 00:36:42.48
Do you mind if I have a little session with them kind of go over what we learned on last appointed or?

495
00:36:43.36 --> 00:36:49.44
Hey about this new regulatory thing that's come out in the business world and I want to get our younger troops to know it

496
00:36:49.44 --> 00:36:55.12
Do you mind if I teach you class on that so you're you're asking them permission and you might even say you know

497
00:36:55.52 --> 00:36:59.52
Hey, I think it would look really good for you too if we were doing this

498
00:37:00.16 --> 00:37:02.16
Do you want to make them look good

499
00:37:03.52 --> 00:37:05.52
And

500
00:37:05.52 --> 00:37:09.20
Those are the ways that you do that you step up and lead

501
00:37:10.08 --> 00:37:15.12
But make sure you're not stepping on your leader because that that could backfire

502
00:37:15.52 --> 00:37:21.48
And you could end up in a situation where they feel intimidated and you're getting put in the dog house

503
00:37:21.76 --> 00:37:29.52
Or fire or demoted or in trouble because they feel intimidated by you so use caution if you have a good leader

504
00:37:29.52 --> 00:37:34.48
Some leaders just aren't that aggressive and when you start getting aggressive they start

505
00:37:34.48 --> 00:37:36.48
They

506
00:37:36.48 --> 00:37:41.68
Actually like the fact that you're getting aggressive and they like I mean I work for some people that love the fact that I would take step up and take charge

507
00:37:41.68 --> 00:37:43.76
They had no problem with it because they were good confident leaders

508
00:37:43.76 --> 00:37:49.64
It's the insecure leader you have to watch out for the insecure leader that's worried about looking bad

509
00:37:50.28 --> 00:37:52.28
And that's another

510
00:37:52.28 --> 00:37:58.24
To change perspective again on this when you as a leader have somebody that's stepping up and taking charge

511
00:37:58.72 --> 00:38:03.16
As and you start feeling intimidated by it ask yourself why it's probably your ego

512
00:38:03.16 --> 00:38:10.76
You're being a weak leader by being intimidated by your subordinates if your subordinate is doing your job and doing it better than you

513
00:38:11.16 --> 00:38:16.04
Let get step up and start looking how can you go up the chain of command? How can you look up and out?

514
00:38:16.04 --> 00:38:21.64
How what other areas can you focus on since that leader has stepped up and has making things happen? That's awesome

515
00:38:22.52 --> 00:38:24.52
That is awesome. We want that

516
00:38:24.52 --> 00:38:31.80
That's decentralized command. That's building other leaders underneath you which is what your goal as a leader should always be

517
00:38:36.20 --> 00:38:40.64
And I'll tell you every time I see some of that goes oh I got a weak leader

518
00:38:40.64 --> 00:38:42.64
I'm always like lucky you

519
00:38:42.64 --> 00:38:47.92
Yeah lucky you take advantage of that take advantage of it do whatever you want

520
00:38:47.92 --> 00:38:54.04
I mean you have such an odd good opportunity when you have a weak leader above you don't look at that don't don't get all down

521
00:38:54.04 --> 00:38:59.04
Trotten because bad boy leader just doesn't motivate you awesome motivate yourself

522
00:38:59.32 --> 00:39:04.96
Get charred getting charge of things take advantage of it make things happen. It's awesome to have a weak leader

523
00:39:04.96 --> 00:39:11.12
I love it get after it. It's good to give me so much mobility in my in my in my

524
00:39:11.84 --> 00:39:16.04
Job right I'm so much more mobility than if I've got someone hey if I got someone that's strongly

525
00:39:16.04 --> 00:39:21.80
That's great too, but weak leaders no factor. I'm gonna take advantage of it. Yeah feel like you

526
00:39:22.80 --> 00:39:24.80
Yes, I would

527
00:39:24.80 --> 00:39:28.52
You're like you got a weak leader and you're kind of

528
00:39:30.12 --> 00:39:32.92
You're not stepping up you're essentially

529
00:39:34.08 --> 00:39:42.60
Allowing the group the team objectives to kind of fail in a way you're kind of allowing it and then in a way too deep into what you do

530
00:39:42.60 --> 00:39:44.12
but

531
00:39:44.12 --> 00:39:46.28
In a way you're kind of being like hey

532
00:39:47.32 --> 00:39:53.44
All right you're allowing the excuse to be valid, you know, where which kind of makes it invalid really when you're like hey

533
00:39:53.44 --> 00:39:57.84
I could step up, but hey, it's the leaders for as long as it's not my fault. You know the my leaders nothing

534
00:39:57.84 --> 00:40:01.40
You know it's you're really not taking much ownership

535
00:40:01.40 --> 00:40:06.76
Yeah, you just point your finger at your leader and say this is a weak leader. Yeah. That's not what we do here

536
00:40:07.40 --> 00:40:11.04
Not what we do at all. Yeah, and the times where I've had weak leaders

537
00:40:11.04 --> 00:40:17.64
I always took advantage of it like I said one time and I've talked about this on the podcast before we fired our leader

538
00:40:17.80 --> 00:40:24.14
You know, we had a little mutiny that only happened once for me, but yeah, it happens that I mean

539
00:40:24.14 --> 00:40:30.42
I obviously I don't know the all the details of that, but in a way isn't that you just stepping up and making it happen

540
00:40:30.42 --> 00:40:31.84
I mean, yeah, it's really the

541
00:40:31.84 --> 00:40:39.76
They're they're depending a result like dang that's that's kind of where we're gonna arrive at really giving us stepping up if that's how it goes down

542
00:40:39.76 --> 00:40:44.52
That's how it goes down, but you stepped up. You saw the problem if there's a problem and that was a problem. There's your solution

543
00:40:44.52 --> 00:40:50.000
I think yes up and down the chain of command. You got to own it for sure

544
00:40:54.12 --> 00:40:56.12
Jaco

545
00:40:56.12 --> 00:41:03.32
Jaco did you do anything ritualistically to get yourself mentally prepared?

546
00:41:04.16 --> 00:41:06.16
focused and

547
00:41:06.16 --> 00:41:08.16
In the proper mindset

548
00:41:08.16 --> 00:41:12.96
So just before carrying out a mission such as self-talk music or other actions

549
00:41:14.56 --> 00:41:17.20
Read up pre-operation

550
00:41:18.20 --> 00:41:20.44
Preparedness for the mental state so

551
00:41:20.44 --> 00:41:27.52
People ask this and it's and it actually sounds like a pretty cool question, right?

552
00:41:27.52 --> 00:41:30.12
I mean, it sounds like a pretty cool question. I'm sure people wonder that

553
00:41:30.76 --> 00:41:32.76
It's a lot of times because

554
00:41:33.56 --> 00:41:37.72
You think seals and soldiers and marines must have some

555
00:41:39.08 --> 00:41:41.76
Kind of deep and incredibly

556
00:41:42.40 --> 00:41:49.28
Meaning full border line religious ceremony that they go to and through in order to prepare

557
00:41:49.28 --> 00:41:51.28
Their mind for combat

558
00:41:53.36 --> 00:41:55.36
Maybe it's a

559
00:41:55.36 --> 00:41:58.000
Maybe it's a meditation on the warrior code or

560
00:41:59.20 --> 00:42:03.56
Maybe it's an aggressive song to peek your adrenaline

561
00:42:04.80 --> 00:42:11.84
Maybe it's a a breathing exercise. We got a special breathing exercise. That's gonna heighten my mental awareness and there's even

562
00:42:13.44 --> 00:42:17.32
Seals and I use that turn loosely that have written

563
00:42:17.32 --> 00:42:22.80
Books on that subject of you know this this warrior

564
00:42:23.32 --> 00:42:30.48
Mind said in the the Navy seal breathing techniques and the the visualization and things like that

565
00:42:33.88 --> 00:42:35.88
No

566
00:42:35.88 --> 00:42:37.16
I

567
00:42:37.16 --> 00:42:41.000
I hate to spoil the romantic vision of the

568
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.92
Mind for warrior poet, but that actually

569
00:42:48.32 --> 00:42:51.32
That that idea just it does not what happens and

570
00:42:52.44 --> 00:42:54.44
Here's the reality

571
00:42:54.68 --> 00:42:57.68
First and foremost when you are

572
00:42:58.40 --> 00:43:02.72
In combat and you're preparing for an operation you are freaking busy

573
00:43:03.20 --> 00:43:06.80
You are busy you are planning you're doing coordination

574
00:43:06.80 --> 00:43:11.72
You're doing gear prep you're doing briefings you're making all these adjustments and changes to everything that's happening

575
00:43:11.72 --> 00:43:17.48
You don't we are scrambling around us talking to leave the other day and and there was almost the time

576
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:25.16
If we were going on in the field on an operation we wouldn't be sleeping for 24 hours before we went in the field

577
00:43:25.44 --> 00:43:30.20
You know, maybe we get two or three hours, but it was a sleep deprivation before we went in the field

578
00:43:30.20 --> 00:43:38.80
Because of all the planning and preparation that needed to be done especially on the big operations with battalion sized or or brigade sized operations

579
00:43:39.24 --> 00:43:44.08
There's so much planning and preparation that needs to be done that you don't have you you're not just

580
00:43:45.48 --> 00:43:50.16
You're not just sitting around figuring out what kind of mental prep you're gonna do

581
00:43:50.16 --> 00:43:52.16
There's just last minute detail

582
00:43:52.16 --> 00:43:58.64
There's a phone call you got a place to hire headquarters. There's a a decant fish and document that you got to prepare you got to

583
00:43:58.64 --> 00:44:02.12
You got to get stuff done so taking some

584
00:44:03.72 --> 00:44:07.36
Some kind of meditative moments to get in the right mindset

585
00:44:08.48 --> 00:44:13.44
It's just not happening. Just don't have the time for it now that being said

586
00:44:15.36 --> 00:44:24.44
Mindset it is a part of combat right and so how did I get in the right mission mindset

587
00:44:24.44 --> 00:44:30.64
Well the mindset is not achieved in the minutes or even hours

588
00:44:31.64 --> 00:44:33.64
before an operation

589
00:44:34.68 --> 00:44:42.04
From you know chanting a mantra or breathing or meditation or listening to some song that's gonna get you in touch with your warrior spirit

590
00:44:42.16 --> 00:44:44.88
The mindset is achieved in the

591
00:44:45.36 --> 00:44:49.000
the weeks and the months and the years

592
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.56
Before that specific operation commences, that's another thing

593
00:44:55.36 --> 00:45:02.08
The the idea from that actually I was raised on in the 90s in the seal teams was like you were gonna do a mission

594
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.56
We used to joke about it called the big mesh right the big mission was gonna come

595
00:45:07.56 --> 00:45:09.16
It was gonna be one mission

596
00:45:09.16 --> 00:45:12.04
Right and you could get hey we're gonna plan for it

597
00:45:12.04 --> 00:45:17.56
We're gonna plan for it for weeks maybe even months and we're gonna be able to visualize everything and we're gonna have all this time

598
00:45:17.56 --> 00:45:22.04
The reality is overseas, you know since the war started man you're doing an operation every night

599
00:45:22.04 --> 00:45:26.40
You're going out you got another week come back your plan and for that one and well and when that one gets canceled for whatever

600
00:45:26.40 --> 00:45:29.60
Reason there's two more that you're planning for you're running out to grab intelligence your meet with somebody else

601
00:45:29.60 --> 00:45:33.72
It's just constantly ongoing so we weren't ever preparing for one mission

602
00:45:33.72 --> 00:45:37.72
We were planning we were preparing for mission after mission we'd have five six seven ten

603
00:45:37.88 --> 00:45:44.52
We'd have ten operations in the hopper at any given time that we're planning and preparing for we're gathering in

604
00:45:44.52 --> 00:45:48.56
Thousands for we're setting up we're doing route studies for four five different operations at one time

605
00:45:48.56 --> 00:45:52.72
Then finding one rise of the occasion boom we're gonna go hit that one the next night another one's up the top

606
00:45:52.72 --> 00:45:54.72
We're gonna go hit that one

607
00:45:54.72 --> 00:45:59.36
So again this idea that I think came from the 90s of a we're gonna do the big mesh

608
00:45:59.76 --> 00:46:03.44
Yeah, but we're gonna have to get in the mental mindset no we live the mental mindset

609
00:46:03.44 --> 00:46:11.52
But that mindset came from the training that we went through the grueling training through the repetition of the fundamental skill sets

610
00:46:11.52 --> 00:46:14.80
The mindset comes from the discipline

611
00:46:16.24 --> 00:46:23.24
From waking up early from studying tactics from understanding the enemy

612
00:46:25.68 --> 00:46:27.68
From all those

613
00:46:29.24 --> 00:46:38.32
Unmedicated daily disciplines that's where the mindset comes with it comes from and I'll tell you on top of that on top of that

614
00:46:38.32 --> 00:46:42.80
You have to come to grip

615
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
With some pretty horrific potential outcomes, right?

616
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:55.44
You have to accept some solemn possibilities like that you might be severely wounded or that you might be killed

617
00:46:59.36 --> 00:47:03.12
And you also have to think that about the guys

618
00:47:03.12 --> 00:47:09.84
Your your friends that is another possibility that you have to think about

619
00:47:11.04 --> 00:47:13.04
But for yourself you

620
00:47:14.52 --> 00:47:20.36
You have to accept that possibility you have to accept that potential outcome that

621
00:47:21.28 --> 00:47:25.24
You could die and you have to accept that now you don't want it

622
00:47:25.24 --> 00:47:31.56
Of course you want to live, but you have to accept the fact that in the game

623
00:47:33.16 --> 00:47:35.16
the game of

624
00:47:35.16 --> 00:47:37.16
Combat you could very well die and

625
00:47:40.60 --> 00:47:43.80
I knew that and I was okay with it

626
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.76
But but I had come to that conclusion a long time before whenever

627
00:47:49.08 --> 00:47:52.44
Operation I was getting the roll out on one particular night during a

628
00:47:52.44 --> 00:47:54.44
Six month long deployment

629
00:47:55.92 --> 00:47:58.64
So the mindset is built over time and

630
00:48:00.36 --> 00:48:02.36
Like knowledge

631
00:48:02.36 --> 00:48:04.36
That you have

632
00:48:04.36 --> 00:48:10.28
The mindset it becomes so ingrained that knowledge becomes so ingrained that you don't have to

633
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.12
Cram for it like you'd cram for a final exam

634
00:48:14.12 --> 00:48:17.88
You don't have to cram for the test to combat in the last minute you already know

635
00:48:17.88 --> 00:48:27.000
You already have the conference you know you've done everything possible to prepare mentally to prepare physically to prepare emotionally

636
00:48:28.92 --> 00:48:30.92
And then when the call comes

637
00:48:31.96 --> 00:48:39.36
And you put on your camis and you fill up your canteens and you put on your helmet and you lock down your night vision

638
00:48:39.36 --> 00:48:45.84
You lock and load your weapon to roll out the gate you're ready

639
00:48:50.40 --> 00:48:55.92
You've seen the movie gone in 60 seconds no, I have no movies that you've seen

640
00:48:55.92 --> 00:48:57.92
Not a statue

641
00:48:58.16 --> 00:49:02.08
There's a part where they're but they're their car jackers team of

642
00:49:02.96 --> 00:49:06.16
Car thieves they got to do this mission to save the brother

643
00:49:06.16 --> 00:49:09.96
You know they're already tired. That's why but they gotta do you know this one that mission

644
00:49:10.24 --> 00:49:14.60
So big mesh the big mission you have exactly so they go through a thing getting in a mindset drill

645
00:49:14.60 --> 00:49:18.64
So check it out imagine if in the movie they were doing that mission every single night

646
00:49:18.64 --> 00:49:21.84
Yeah, that's gonna not go through that drill every night because they know they've prepared

647
00:49:21.84 --> 00:49:24.48
They know the got their mind right and they're gonna go out and execute the operation

648
00:49:24.88 --> 00:49:26.88
That's the difference

649
00:49:26.88 --> 00:49:30.48
Or maybe they would do it every night. This is what they do. Oh, that's here

650
00:49:31.20 --> 00:49:33.60
Think put on low writer, you know the song

651
00:49:33.60 --> 00:49:35.60
Hmm

652
00:49:35.60 --> 00:49:37.60
Then they just kind of listen to it and then they go

653
00:49:38.48 --> 00:49:40.48
Super subtle

654
00:49:40.64 --> 00:49:45.96
Yeah, maybe check it out. Yeah, you know some guys you know crank up a song

655
00:49:46.08 --> 00:49:50.48
You know we had speaker we actually had speakers outside some of those the guys we blasted some music

656
00:49:50.48 --> 00:49:55.68
But it was no like a ritualistic thing where we all sat there close to rise and listen to the same song at the same time

657
00:49:56.08 --> 00:49:59.36
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean and you know what I was

658
00:49:59.36 --> 00:50:04.72
You know always either what my two combat deployments. I was a platoon commander. I was a task leader commander

659
00:50:04.72 --> 00:50:12.48
So I was busy, you know, I was all that planning stuff that I'm talking about was was me if I was going out if I wasn't going out

660
00:50:12.48 --> 00:50:14.80
Then I wasn't doing anything ritualistically to get ready to go out

661
00:50:16.16 --> 00:50:21.92
But you're busy people understand how busy you are in combat not just while you're on the battlefield

662
00:50:21.92 --> 00:50:23.92
But when you're back in the rear

663
00:50:23.92 --> 00:50:30.88
Preparing to go or preparing or planning for operations. Yeah, oh, to imagine some people you know because even the small

664
00:50:30.88 --> 00:50:37.68
I mean really how deep how far you want to stretch the word like ritual right so the I'm sure some people would right

665
00:50:37.68 --> 00:50:40.64
Maybe like like I said get like a lucky thing or I don't know

666
00:50:40.64 --> 00:50:44.000
Hey, people carried lots now you're getting a different realm here. Yeah, yeah, I'm super-stition

667
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.40
Well, you're also talking about so I had certain patterns that I followed right

668
00:50:48.40 --> 00:50:54.16
But those patterns were not for my mental state they were to be prepared right it was kind of you know

669
00:50:54.16 --> 00:50:58.16
I've talked about how I had to caught filled my gear and when I put all that gear on I was ready

670
00:50:58.16 --> 00:51:02.88
You know, right that's that's that's and I put the gear on the same way every time because you're going through a

671
00:51:03.04 --> 00:51:06.64
Process and a procedure so that you make sure you get anything right even when I'm coming to record the podcast

672
00:51:06.64 --> 00:51:08.32
I do the same thing every time

673
00:51:08.32 --> 00:51:12.32
I get this ready. I get that ready. I print the stuff out. I you know

674
00:51:12.72 --> 00:51:17.04
I bring the same pens the same stupid pens. I bring them all time because I have a pattern that I go through said

675
00:51:17.04 --> 00:51:19.04
I'm ready for what we're gonna do

676
00:51:19.44 --> 00:51:23.12
That's a standard operating procedure to be ready for the operation

677
00:51:23.52 --> 00:51:25.52
Whether it gets me to mental state

678
00:51:26.32 --> 00:51:31.78
Yeah, I guess it does get a little mental stand technically that is a ritual well, then you can I guess I'm busted

679
00:51:31.78 --> 00:51:34.96
There you know, no, no, no, no, no, no you're the man of course for sure you know busted

680
00:51:34.96 --> 00:51:39.20
No, I think I am busted because that is definitely a a ritualistic

681
00:51:39.76 --> 00:51:42.48
thing to go through and if I talk about

682
00:51:42.48 --> 00:51:44.76
about being in combat, sure.

683
00:51:44.76 --> 00:51:46.28
We, you're getting your gear on,

684
00:51:46.28 --> 00:51:48.68
you're zero out, you're programming your radio,

685
00:51:48.68 --> 00:51:50.04
you're getting radio checkers.

686
00:51:50.04 --> 00:51:54.68
But again, the reason it doesn't really hit me

687
00:51:54.68 --> 00:51:58.08
as a ritualistic thing, because those are standard procedures

688
00:51:58.08 --> 00:51:59.72
that you're going to prepare for the mission.

689
00:51:59.72 --> 00:52:02.68
They're physical things that have to be done.

690
00:52:02.68 --> 00:52:04.16
They're not for mental preparation.

691
00:52:04.16 --> 00:52:07.72
Now, does your mind know what's coming?

692
00:52:07.72 --> 00:52:09.40
Yes, and I'll tell you a classic example

693
00:52:09.40 --> 00:52:11.36
is when you put down your night vision,

694
00:52:11.36 --> 00:52:12.76
which for those of you who don't understand this,

695
00:52:12.76 --> 00:52:14.80
you have a helmet on, and you have night vision on it.

696
00:52:14.80 --> 00:52:18.04
It can flip up where you're just looking through your regular eyes,

697
00:52:18.04 --> 00:52:19.24
but then when you back out the vehicles

698
00:52:19.24 --> 00:52:20.92
and you flip your night vision down,

699
00:52:20.92 --> 00:52:22.12
you're in a different world.

700
00:52:22.12 --> 00:52:24.24
You're in a green world of darkness

701
00:52:24.24 --> 00:52:27.04
where you know what's about to year about to do.

702
00:52:27.04 --> 00:52:30.28
So whenever I flip my night vision down,

703
00:52:30.28 --> 00:52:32.24
it would always give me a sensation.

704
00:52:32.24 --> 00:52:35.04
But again, it wasn't, this is preparing me.

705
00:52:35.04 --> 00:52:36.92
I knew that it was time, right?

706
00:52:36.92 --> 00:52:37.76
There's a difference.

707
00:52:37.76 --> 00:52:39.16
There's a subtle difference?

708
00:52:39.16 --> 00:52:40.000
No difference?

709
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.16
No, I'm sure there is a difference,

710
00:52:41.16 --> 00:52:44.52
but there's overlap there where I think that is.

711
00:52:44.52 --> 00:52:46.80
I mean, like I said, it depends how loose you wanna use the word

712
00:52:46.80 --> 00:52:50.08
ritual, but technically, yeah, like remember you said one time,

713
00:52:50.08 --> 00:52:52.08
you said something about before you guys rolled out.

714
00:52:52.08 --> 00:52:54.56
Everyone starts there and it's the same time ritual.

715
00:52:54.56 --> 00:52:55.40
Right there.

716
00:52:55.40 --> 00:52:59.68
And ritual, however, standard operation features.

717
00:52:59.68 --> 00:53:00.84
Yeah, it's a function.

718
00:53:00.84 --> 00:53:02.36
Something like, well, you've got to put your night vision

719
00:53:02.36 --> 00:53:03.20
goggles down.

720
00:53:03.20 --> 00:53:04.40
You have to do that.

721
00:53:04.40 --> 00:53:06.12
It's what you're gonna do.

722
00:53:06.12 --> 00:53:10.36
And when you do that, because you've done it 100 times before,

723
00:53:10.36 --> 00:53:12.88
you know that that's now game on.

724
00:53:12.88 --> 00:53:16.12
But if you're just putting your night vision goggles down,

725
00:53:16.12 --> 00:53:17.28
that's not really the ritual.

726
00:53:17.28 --> 00:53:20.000
But if it's like, I'm gonna put my night vision goggles down

727
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.24
after I do this every single time, that's a ritual.

728
00:53:23.24 --> 00:53:24.60
Or we all do it together.

729
00:53:24.60 --> 00:53:27.24
Like when it's your, you're calling it a ritual.

730
00:53:27.24 --> 00:53:31.08
You're putting a ritualistic flavor to it.

731
00:53:31.08 --> 00:53:32.64
It's a standard operating procedure.

732
00:53:32.64 --> 00:53:33.76
They can be processed.

733
00:53:33.76 --> 00:53:37.52
They can put it on saying it's not ritualistic

734
00:53:37.52 --> 00:53:41.80
because there was no embedded, deeper meaning

735
00:53:41.80 --> 00:53:44.64
that was put on top of it purposely.

736
00:53:44.64 --> 00:53:45.48
Right.

737
00:53:45.48 --> 00:53:46.64
It's not very ceremonial.

738
00:53:46.64 --> 00:53:47.48
We're trying to make it.

739
00:53:47.48 --> 00:53:49.32
We're trying to make it in some of it's not.

740
00:53:49.32 --> 00:53:50.16
Right.

741
00:53:50.16 --> 00:53:51.80
Do you fall the same standard operating procedures?

742
00:53:51.80 --> 00:53:52.80
Yes.

743
00:53:52.80 --> 00:53:55.88
So do you, and when we talk about fighters,

744
00:53:55.88 --> 00:53:58.52
you know, I've been with a lot of fighters and coach them.

745
00:53:58.52 --> 00:54:01.68
And those guys have little ritualistic things to get

746
00:54:01.68 --> 00:54:03.08
sometimes it is music, right?

747
00:54:03.08 --> 00:54:04.52
Because they're gonna go fight a five minute round.

748
00:54:04.52 --> 00:54:06.20
They're gonna listen to something or they're gonna,

749
00:54:06.20 --> 00:54:07.32
they're gonna sit there and close their eyes

750
00:54:07.32 --> 00:54:08.84
and think about what's important to them.

751
00:54:08.84 --> 00:54:09.68
That's fine.

752
00:54:09.68 --> 00:54:13.000
I'm telling you, when I was overseas,

753
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.56
I didn't have time to do any of that.

754
00:54:14.56 --> 00:54:18.96
We were running around, never once did I say standby.

755
00:54:18.96 --> 00:54:20.88
Hey, no one talked to me for the next three minutes.

756
00:54:20.88 --> 00:54:21.72
Right.

757
00:54:21.72 --> 00:54:22.56
Well, I get in the zone.

758
00:54:22.56 --> 00:54:23.40
No.

759
00:54:23.40 --> 00:54:25.44
I was in the zone because I spent my, you know,

760
00:54:25.44 --> 00:54:27.76
did a workup, did you spent my time in the team

761
00:54:27.76 --> 00:54:30.20
and went through training, you know, shot my gun,

762
00:54:30.20 --> 00:54:31.84
knew what I was doing.

763
00:54:31.84 --> 00:54:34.20
And so I didn't need to get in the zone.

764
00:54:34.20 --> 00:54:36.92
And I think that's why I think I'm sensitive

765
00:54:36.92 --> 00:54:39.72
to this and here's why I think I'm sensitive to this.

766
00:54:39.72 --> 00:54:41.20
I think I'm sensitive to this

767
00:54:41.20 --> 00:54:45.80
because I think people try and tell, tell people

768
00:54:45.80 --> 00:54:50.20
or sell people on the fact that if you do these things,

769
00:54:50.20 --> 00:54:54.08
it will prepare you mentally for, you know,

770
00:54:54.08 --> 00:54:55.64
a pressure situation.

771
00:54:55.64 --> 00:54:57.88
And that's what bothers me about it.

772
00:54:57.88 --> 00:54:59.48
That's what bothers me about it is,

773
00:54:59.48 --> 00:55:02.48
hey, if you do this, if you, this is what it is.

774
00:55:02.48 --> 00:55:04.80
If you take this shortcut,

775
00:55:04.80 --> 00:55:09.80
then you will be prepared because I would never tell someone,

776
00:55:10.48 --> 00:55:12.16
oh, you want to fight an MMA fight.

777
00:55:12.16 --> 00:55:13.08
You're going to get in the cage.

778
00:55:13.08 --> 00:55:15.96
Cool. Here's what you need to do to train for that.

779
00:55:15.96 --> 00:55:18.36
Three minutes before you enter the cage,

780
00:55:18.36 --> 00:55:21.000
go into a room, shut your eyes and think about

781
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.32
how you're going to win the fight.

782
00:55:22.32 --> 00:55:24.08
That is not true.

783
00:55:24.08 --> 00:55:26.96
Now, this is, I guess this is where you've just,

784
00:55:26.96 --> 00:55:28.40
you've just gotten this out of me,

785
00:55:28.40 --> 00:55:31.80
echo, you took me to my point that I believe in, right?

786
00:55:31.80 --> 00:55:32.96
Yeah.

787
00:55:32.96 --> 00:55:34.84
That is not what prepares you for the fight.

788
00:55:34.84 --> 00:55:37.92
What prepares you for the fight is the years

789
00:55:37.92 --> 00:55:40.60
and years of training that you've done to get there.

790
00:55:40.60 --> 00:55:42.88
The last three minutes, you can have a ritual

791
00:55:42.88 --> 00:55:44.60
and it can put your mind in a right place,

792
00:55:44.60 --> 00:55:47.44
but that's not what's putting your mind into the right place.

793
00:55:47.44 --> 00:55:48.92
What's putting your mind in the right place

794
00:55:48.92 --> 00:55:51.16
is the months and months and years of training,

795
00:55:51.16 --> 00:55:52.68
same thing with on the battlefield.

796
00:55:52.68 --> 00:55:54.72
If someone said, hey, I'm about to go execute

797
00:55:54.72 --> 00:55:58.16
a direct action mission.

798
00:55:58.16 --> 00:56:00.24
What should I do to prepare for that?

799
00:56:00.24 --> 00:56:02.60
I wouldn't say, well, what you need to do,

800
00:56:02.60 --> 00:56:05.92
is listen to your favorite motorhead song.

801
00:56:05.92 --> 00:56:06.76
Yeah.

802
00:56:06.76 --> 00:56:08.08
That is not going to help you.

803
00:56:08.08 --> 00:56:09.36
What you need to do is you need to do this.

804
00:56:09.36 --> 00:56:10.40
You need to go this shooting.

805
00:56:10.40 --> 00:56:12.48
You need to work on these type of tactics.

806
00:56:12.48 --> 00:56:13.56
You need to understand what to do

807
00:56:13.56 --> 00:56:15.60
and someone gets when you need to have standard operating procedures

808
00:56:15.60 --> 00:56:17.000
for how to go into and out of buildings.

809
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.76
You need to understand how to clear rooms

810
00:56:18.76 --> 00:56:21.08
with open doors, closed doors, corner fed rooms.

811
00:56:21.08 --> 00:56:23.72
All these different things that you need to know.

812
00:56:23.72 --> 00:56:25.64
I would tell you all of that stuff.

813
00:56:25.64 --> 00:56:28.04
But what I don't like is when someone says,

814
00:56:28.04 --> 00:56:30.64
oh, what you need to do to be ready is do these?

815
00:56:30.64 --> 00:56:34.000
Do this last fraction of the thing.

816
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
And that's what's going to prepare you for combat.

817
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.56
No, not true.

818
00:56:37.56 --> 00:56:39.16
What prepares you for combat?

819
00:56:39.16 --> 00:56:40.48
What prepares you for a fight?

820
00:56:40.48 --> 00:56:42.64
What prepares you for a tough business decision?

821
00:56:42.64 --> 00:56:44.36
What prepares you for a pressure scenario

822
00:56:44.36 --> 00:56:47.56
that you're going into isn't the three minutes before.

823
00:56:47.56 --> 00:56:49.52
That's the icing on the cake.

824
00:56:49.52 --> 00:56:51.24
So I don't want to focus on that.

825
00:56:51.24 --> 00:56:54.60
I want to focus on the daily disciplines for months

826
00:56:54.60 --> 00:56:57.24
and weeks and years that led you up to the point

827
00:56:57.24 --> 00:57:00.28
so that when I went in combat for the first time

828
00:57:00.28 --> 00:57:03.32
and shot my gun for the first time,

829
00:57:03.32 --> 00:57:05.76
it wasn't about the song that I listened to.

830
00:57:05.76 --> 00:57:07.92
It wasn't about the breathing that I did.

831
00:57:07.92 --> 00:57:10.76
It was the discipline and the training that got me there.

832
00:57:10.76 --> 00:57:13.12
So maybe I was a little bit hard coming out

833
00:57:13.12 --> 00:57:16.40
of the gate on this idea, but that's why I was hard.

834
00:57:16.40 --> 00:57:18.88
And I didn't really understand that in my own mind

835
00:57:18.88 --> 00:57:22.000
until you started bleeding me down this road.

836
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.92
Because that stuff does, when I see somebody trying to sell that,

837
00:57:24.92 --> 00:57:25.92
I don't like that.

838
00:57:25.92 --> 00:57:27.000
Yep, I don't like that.

839
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Do I have rituals?

840
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:28.84
Yes, I am.

841
00:57:28.84 --> 00:57:31.04
I even have rituals for when I get up in the morning.

842
00:57:31.04 --> 00:57:33.56
And what I do, I feel my water bottle.

843
00:57:33.56 --> 00:57:35.72
My water bottle every night, when I go to bed,

844
00:57:35.72 --> 00:57:36.76
is in the same spot.

845
00:57:36.76 --> 00:57:38.28
When I get up out of bed in the morning,

846
00:57:38.28 --> 00:57:39.52
my water bottle is there.

847
00:57:39.52 --> 00:57:42.36
I put my, you know, I go very quietly in the bathroom

848
00:57:42.36 --> 00:57:44.20
when we talk about this, I do what I got to do in there.

849
00:57:44.20 --> 00:57:46.44
I come out, I grab my water bottle.

850
00:57:46.44 --> 00:57:47.32
It's already where I know it's gonna be

851
00:57:47.32 --> 00:57:48.56
on any different learning lights.

852
00:57:48.56 --> 00:57:49.96
It's where it's supposed to be.

853
00:57:49.96 --> 00:57:50.80
That's a ritual.

854
00:57:50.80 --> 00:57:53.28
I go to the kitchen, it's dark in the kitchen.

855
00:57:53.28 --> 00:57:55.40
I fill up the water bottle by sound.

856
00:57:55.40 --> 00:57:57.04
Because you know how that's a little beautiful sound

857
00:57:57.04 --> 00:57:58.44
as it fills up, it gets higher and higher

858
00:57:58.44 --> 00:57:59.56
than boom, you kill it.

859
00:57:59.56 --> 00:58:02.64
Now I walk out, I flip on a light in the back of the house,

860
00:58:02.64 --> 00:58:04.48
put the shoes on.

861
00:58:04.48 --> 00:58:05.72
Because I'm not bothering anyone.

862
00:58:05.72 --> 00:58:07.000
So there's a little ritual there.

863
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.24
When I walk up to the gym, plug in the music

864
00:58:10.24 --> 00:58:12.16
and now it's time to get after it.

865
00:58:12.16 --> 00:58:13.28
So there's a ritual there.

866
00:58:13.28 --> 00:58:15.84
There's even when I go to the gym and do jjitsu,

867
00:58:15.84 --> 00:58:17.84
I have a little ritual that I follow there.

868
00:58:17.84 --> 00:58:21.20
I come in, I tape the fingers, I do what I got to do.

869
00:58:21.20 --> 00:58:22.96
For those of you people that are gonna ask,

870
00:58:22.96 --> 00:58:26.32
I tape the two fingers on my right hand,

871
00:58:26.32 --> 00:58:29.36
my pinky and my ring finger on my right hand,

872
00:58:29.36 --> 00:58:31.76
because my pinky's got a little judo finger, right?

873
00:58:31.76 --> 00:58:33.72
So I tape those two together.

874
00:58:33.72 --> 00:58:35.80
And also gives me a little bit of that friction

875
00:58:35.80 --> 00:58:37.76
on the guillotine, at least that's why I've told Echo

876
00:58:37.76 --> 00:58:40.44
to further intimidate and scare about the guillotine.

877
00:58:41.64 --> 00:58:44.80
So there's some little ritualistic things there.

878
00:58:44.80 --> 00:58:49.80
If Dean's there, when I'll go in the sauna for five minutes

879
00:58:49.80 --> 00:58:51.32
and just get a little bit warm before,

880
00:58:51.32 --> 00:58:53.84
and he sees me sweating, he doesn't like to see me sweating

881
00:58:53.84 --> 00:58:55.88
because he knows that I'm, it's on.

882
00:58:55.88 --> 00:58:56.84
It's on, right?

883
00:58:56.84 --> 00:58:58.84
So I'll go in there just to send a little mental vibe

884
00:58:58.84 --> 00:58:59.88
to Dean that you know what,

885
00:58:59.88 --> 00:59:01.96
Joc was already sweating, he says, damn.

886
00:59:03.32 --> 00:59:07.16
So those ritualistic things, those are the fraction,

887
00:59:07.16 --> 00:59:10.28
the tiniest part of what you need to do to prepare.

888
00:59:10.28 --> 00:59:12.24
The preparation, the mindset,

889
00:59:12.24 --> 00:59:13.92
doesn't come from those things.

890
00:59:13.92 --> 00:59:16.84
You wanna, you wanna close out that final bit

891
00:59:16.84 --> 00:59:18.24
and make it something ritualistic

892
00:59:18.24 --> 00:59:20.60
to get you in the right mindset, do it.

893
00:59:20.60 --> 00:59:23.12
But that is not where the money is made.

894
00:59:23.12 --> 00:59:24.96
The money is made and everything that leads up

895
00:59:24.96 --> 00:59:27.80
to that was the final three minutes or two minutes

896
00:59:27.80 --> 00:59:29.68
or five minutes of ritualistic behavior

897
00:59:29.68 --> 00:59:33.88
that you have to get you ready to rock and roll.

898
00:59:33.88 --> 00:59:36.84
So bring it.

899
00:59:36.84 --> 00:59:38.52
What can we extrapolate there?

900
00:59:38.52 --> 00:59:40.96
So the question is no, really?

901
00:59:40.96 --> 00:59:42.000
I mean, you maintain really

902
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:42.80
because the question is,

903
00:59:42.80 --> 00:59:44.16
do you do anything ritualistically

904
00:59:44.16 --> 00:59:46.04
to get yourself mentally prepared focus

905
00:59:46.04 --> 00:59:46.88
in proper mindset?

906
00:59:46.88 --> 00:59:50.40
So you don't, but you do do things that are rituals.

907
00:59:50.40 --> 00:59:51.36
But that's not the question.

908
00:59:51.36 --> 00:59:52.36
This is one of the questions.

909
00:59:52.36 --> 00:59:56.52
The rituals you're talking about in regards to,

910
00:59:56.52 --> 00:59:57.92
oh, yeah, let's go.

911
00:59:57.92 --> 00:59:59.12
What rituals did I have?

912
00:59:59.12 --> 01:00:02.44
What rituals did I have in preparing for combat,

913
01:00:02.44 --> 01:00:05.32
training my ass off, being prepared,

914
01:00:05.32 --> 01:00:08.16
studying the enemy, being in crop physical condition,

915
01:00:08.16 --> 01:00:11.44
those are the rituals, the rituals are the training.

916
01:00:11.44 --> 01:00:14.36
And the rituals, like I said, for the 20th time,

917
01:00:14.36 --> 01:00:15.64
that little tiny thing,

918
01:00:15.64 --> 01:00:17.44
those are just standard operating procedures.

919
01:00:17.44 --> 01:00:21.000
And when you do those ritualistically,

920
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.88
then you're, then you number one, you won't forget

921
01:00:22.88 --> 01:00:23.72
everything.

922
01:00:23.72 --> 01:00:25.92
You'll know that you have all your gear.

923
01:00:25.92 --> 01:00:29.04
You'll know that you've done what you're supposed to do.

924
01:00:29.04 --> 01:00:31.52
And when you put your night vision goggles down,

925
01:00:31.52 --> 01:00:33.32
you'll know that it's on.

926
01:00:33.32 --> 01:00:34.16
Straight.

927
01:00:34.16 --> 01:00:36.12
And you'll be mentally prepared.

928
01:00:36.12 --> 01:00:40.16
So your standard operating procedures

929
01:00:40.16 --> 01:00:43.36
are rituals by technicality.

930
01:00:43.36 --> 01:00:44.20
Sure.

931
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:46.84
Sure.

932
01:00:46.84 --> 01:00:47.68
There you go.

933
01:00:47.68 --> 01:00:49.40
If for those of you that aren't watching this on YouTube,

934
01:00:49.40 --> 01:00:53.44
Echo just looked extremely proud of the statement right there.

935
01:00:53.44 --> 01:00:55.04
No, I wasn't friends.

936
01:00:55.04 --> 01:00:56.44
By the way, I said, I'm proud of they are.

937
01:00:56.44 --> 01:00:59.44
I'm proud that I had some influence on them.

938
01:00:59.44 --> 01:01:04.20
I don't want to completely beat a dead horse.

939
01:01:04.20 --> 01:01:07.48
Because, but what bothers me about that idea

940
01:01:07.48 --> 01:01:11.08
is people thinking they can cut corners on the preparation.

941
01:01:11.08 --> 01:01:12.52
You can't cut corners.

942
01:01:12.52 --> 01:01:13.56
That's my point.

943
01:01:13.56 --> 01:01:14.92
You can't cut corners.

944
01:01:14.92 --> 01:01:17.28
And think you're going to get the three minute preparation

945
01:01:17.28 --> 01:01:19.04
to be ready for combat, to be ready for battle,

946
01:01:19.04 --> 01:01:21.000
feel ready for pressure situation,

947
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.92
to be ready for a tough business decision.

948
01:01:22.92 --> 01:01:25.16
You don't get ready for that in three minutes.

949
01:01:25.16 --> 01:01:27.80
You get ready for that for months and years.

950
01:01:27.80 --> 01:01:29.60
That's how you prepare for it.

951
01:01:29.60 --> 01:01:32.000
Well, I was a youthful football at UH.

952
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.60
And we had this, I don't know if you're watching

953
01:01:34.60 --> 01:01:35.28
like football.

954
01:01:35.28 --> 01:01:36.88
I can't brag.

955
01:01:36.88 --> 01:01:38.68
No, I'm laying down the set.

956
01:01:38.68 --> 01:01:39.72
We already knew that though.

957
01:01:39.72 --> 01:01:40.08
Oh, OK.

958
01:01:40.08 --> 01:01:42.36
OK.

959
01:01:42.36 --> 01:01:43.24
Anyway.

960
01:01:43.24 --> 01:01:44.36
So I was a wider seever.

961
01:01:44.36 --> 01:01:46.40
And for the drill, I'd receive her.

962
01:01:46.40 --> 01:01:48.40
I was a lot smaller back then.

963
01:01:48.40 --> 01:01:51.36
I was like 180, 180, whatever.

964
01:01:51.36 --> 01:01:54.28
Nonetheless, one of the drills was this,

965
01:01:54.28 --> 01:01:55.60
if you know football can't be on this,

966
01:01:55.60 --> 01:01:58.60
it's like it's a motor on a big tripod.

967
01:01:58.60 --> 01:02:02.80
And on the motor are these spinning tires.

968
01:02:02.80 --> 01:02:04.52
And they spin this way.

969
01:02:04.52 --> 01:02:05.68
There's three of them.

970
01:02:05.68 --> 01:02:08.24
So they go on this weird skewed angle.

971
01:02:08.24 --> 01:02:11.20
So basically you load a football from the back.

972
01:02:11.20 --> 01:02:12.24
And you push it through.

973
01:02:12.24 --> 01:02:14.28
And it shoots the ball like, yeah.

974
01:02:14.28 --> 01:02:16.000
And there's different speeds and stuff like that.

975
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000
So my coach, well, this is named Coach Miles.

976
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.96
My frigate of thousands first name or last name.

977
01:02:22.96 --> 01:02:25.60
Anyway, Coach Miles, he wasn't a very nice coach.

978
01:02:25.60 --> 01:02:29.20
So he would drill us with it, right?

979
01:02:29.20 --> 01:02:30.24
Which is fine.

980
01:02:30.24 --> 01:02:31.92
That part is cool because it's training.

981
01:02:31.92 --> 01:02:34.88
But the part that I didn't think was very cool was

982
01:02:34.88 --> 01:02:37.76
if you missed, there was you would pay a price.

983
01:02:37.76 --> 01:02:40.000
Like you yell at you.

984
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.76
Some time, yeah, he'd make you run.

985
01:02:41.76 --> 01:02:44.16
Like if you missed, it wasn't like, it was like,

986
01:02:44.16 --> 01:02:46.24
to me, the punishment, it was wrong.

987
01:02:46.24 --> 01:02:47.20
Like the system was wrong.

988
01:02:47.20 --> 01:02:48.88
And punishment didn't fit the crime.

989
01:02:48.88 --> 01:02:51.36
Well, yeah, it wasn't like, this isn't going to make you

990
01:02:51.36 --> 01:02:53.92
better to put more pressure on this drill.

991
01:02:53.92 --> 01:02:56.08
You know, it was more like, hey, look, hey,

992
01:02:56.08 --> 01:02:57.84
but he wants to cause stress.

993
01:02:57.84 --> 01:02:59.12
OK, OK, good, good.

994
01:02:59.12 --> 01:03:01.44
I didn't feel that at the time.

995
01:03:01.44 --> 01:03:03.04
And now, I mean, I'd have to think about it more.

996
01:03:03.04 --> 01:03:03.84
I thought about it.

997
01:03:03.84 --> 01:03:06.000
I bet your whole day's your viewpoint would be different.

998
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.44
Maybe, but maybe not though.

999
01:03:07.44 --> 01:03:09.12
No, no, I don't think so.

1000
01:03:09.12 --> 01:03:12.48
Only because I think that you're trying to get the best out of these people,

1001
01:03:12.48 --> 01:03:14.40
you know, for a specific, but on the game day, there's

1002
01:03:14.40 --> 01:03:15.84
going to be a lot of pressure.

1003
01:03:15.84 --> 01:03:18.72
And you can actually get used to that stress by

1004
01:03:18.72 --> 01:03:20.08
an occupating yourself to it.

1005
01:03:20.08 --> 01:03:22.08
By him saying, look, you got to catch this ball.

1006
01:03:22.08 --> 01:03:22.96
You're going to pay the man.

1007
01:03:22.96 --> 01:03:24.72
Yeah, or just get better at catching.

1008
01:03:24.72 --> 01:03:25.88
So you can get it.

1009
01:03:25.88 --> 01:03:26.20
No, no, no.

1010
01:03:26.20 --> 01:03:29.04
So you can focus on getting better at taking stress or getting

1011
01:03:29.04 --> 01:03:29.84
better catching.

1012
01:03:29.84 --> 01:03:31.68
OK, and to give you this focusing on the game.

1013
01:03:31.68 --> 01:03:34.96
Now, what I would say is that he should have combined both of them.

1014
01:03:34.96 --> 01:03:37.12
And he should have given you guys ample time to just

1015
01:03:37.12 --> 01:03:38.56
practice the catching part.

1016
01:03:38.56 --> 01:03:40.48
And then later up the stress.

1017
01:03:40.48 --> 01:03:42.48
And then that would have been great if he did that.

1018
01:03:42.48 --> 01:03:43.60
In fact, he did not.

1019
01:03:43.60 --> 01:03:47.28
So back to the virtual mental preparation, whatever.

1020
01:03:47.28 --> 01:03:50.32
So that would be stressful for me as a young guy.

1021
01:03:50.32 --> 01:03:52.40
I was like 17 when I started football.

1022
01:03:52.40 --> 01:03:53.36
You know, late for anyway.

1023
01:03:53.36 --> 01:03:56.32
So I'm like one of the young guys and he'd end.

1024
01:03:56.32 --> 01:03:59.84
So when he'd do stuff like to make it harder and harder and harder.

1025
01:03:59.84 --> 01:04:02.24
So of course you're going to miss.

1026
01:04:02.24 --> 01:04:04.64
So there's this one where it's like ball.

1027
01:04:04.64 --> 01:04:07.12
And then you know, you just will turn around the balls on its way.

1028
01:04:07.12 --> 01:04:08.24
Full speed things.

1029
01:04:08.24 --> 01:04:09.28
Like it doesn't think I'm drawn hard.

1030
01:04:09.28 --> 01:04:11.52
Anyway, so you'd miss and then he'd get all mad.

1031
01:04:11.52 --> 01:04:12.96
So anyway, I'm stressed now.

1032
01:04:12.96 --> 01:04:17.68
Now every practice I'm going to stress about that one drill that we're going to do.

1033
01:04:17.68 --> 01:04:22.16
So before practice, we had this cool real nice facility.

1034
01:04:22.16 --> 01:04:24.80
There's this lounge where everyone just kind of cruising mellow out.

1035
01:04:24.80 --> 01:04:30.96
Because you know, from class to pre-practice prep and some meetings and then practice.

1036
01:04:30.96 --> 01:04:33.52
There's a little bit of downtime where you can melt out in the lounge.

1037
01:04:33.52 --> 01:04:36.24
So in the lounge, it closed my eyes a lot of the time and be like this.

1038
01:04:36.24 --> 01:04:37.68
Specialized that ball.

1039
01:04:37.68 --> 01:04:38.88
Only for the drill.

1040
01:04:38.88 --> 01:04:40.40
Not in the skirmish time.

1041
01:04:40.40 --> 01:04:41.92
Skirmish time no problem.

1042
01:04:41.92 --> 01:04:44.40
But I'm visually mentally preparing for the drill.

1043
01:04:44.96 --> 01:04:46.96
All right, this is just doesn't it's right.

1044
01:04:46.96 --> 01:04:47.28
Anyway.

1045
01:04:48.88 --> 01:04:52.08
So yeah, mentally, mentally,

1046
01:04:52.08 --> 01:04:55.44
visualizing the ball coming in at crazy speed.

1047
01:04:55.44 --> 01:04:58.80
And I'm catching him, I'm catching him all in my little visualization.

1048
01:05:00.08 --> 01:05:04.72
So I go and as time went on, I kept doing that over and over and over.

1049
01:05:05.44 --> 01:05:06.48
Did I help to drill at all?

1050
01:05:06.48 --> 01:05:09.68
Well, failed.

1051
01:05:09.68 --> 01:05:12.40
Like as far as any kind of effect, I would catch some,

1052
01:05:12.40 --> 01:05:15.44
yeah, miss some, get yelled at more stress next to any of them.

1053
01:05:15.44 --> 01:05:16.40
Much same thing.

1054
01:05:16.40 --> 01:05:18.48
Yeah, I would say this first of all,

1055
01:05:18.48 --> 01:05:23.28
visualization of a physical technique is proven to help.

1056
01:05:23.28 --> 01:05:24.80
So it didn't help in your case.

1057
01:05:24.80 --> 01:05:29.04
What I would have said would have been the most helpful for you is to say,

1058
01:05:29.04 --> 01:05:31.44
you know what, I don't care what this guy does to me.

1059
01:05:31.44 --> 01:05:34.24
Yeah, I don't care if I miss this ball and I'm a goather and have fun.

1060
01:05:34.24 --> 01:05:36.40
Yeah, you want to do something like a maniac.

1061
01:05:36.40 --> 01:05:39.84
Yeah, I'm going to have such a good time running down the field and when he calls ball,

1062
01:05:39.84 --> 01:05:41.84
I'm going to turn around and do my best to grab that thing.

1063
01:05:41.84 --> 01:05:46.08
If I don't grab it, I'm going to do 14 summer salts and I'm going to have a good time.

1064
01:05:46.08 --> 01:05:49.52
And so that would, you could take an impression off yourself because that's probably what was,

1065
01:05:49.52 --> 01:05:52.64
what was, uh, jamming you up as you like to say.

1066
01:05:52.64 --> 01:05:57.68
So this, and I'll say this too, back to this whole idea, right?

1067
01:05:57.68 --> 01:06:05.12
Another thing that, that I, that I've feel this sort of allergy to this type of thing is,

1068
01:06:05.12 --> 01:06:10.24
it's sort of like, uh, on the Tim Ferriss episode where I was just answering questions.

1069
01:06:10.24 --> 01:06:15.92
I'm going to ask about motivation and I said, like, motivation isn't isn't your friend, right?

1070
01:06:15.92 --> 01:06:17.44
Motivation is going to go up and down.

1071
01:06:17.44 --> 01:06:21.20
I feel like, you know, what's going to be good is discipline.

1072
01:06:21.20 --> 01:06:24.56
Discipline. And so there's really, that's the difference between what I'm talking about here.

1073
01:06:24.56 --> 01:06:28.56
Yeah. When we're talking about, hey, what do you do to get in a mindset? Well, that's really

1074
01:06:28.56 --> 01:06:32.72
talking about, you know, your mental mindset of motivation. No, but what I'm talking about is

1075
01:06:32.72 --> 01:06:39.36
discipline standard operating procedures that actually prepare you for what you're about to do.

1076
01:06:39.36 --> 01:06:44.08
Not that motivate you temporarily by listening to a good song or by doing some breathing

1077
01:06:44.08 --> 01:06:49.76
drill that gets you mentally, but no, the discipline is what's going to make you mentally

1078
01:06:49.76 --> 01:06:53.92
prepared for what's about to happen. So again, that's why I think I'm, I'm a little bit stuck in

1079
01:06:53.92 --> 01:06:59.20
a mud on this one and I'm trying to have an open mind, but I think those are the key components

1080
01:06:59.20 --> 01:07:04.72
for me. I don't like when people try and sell shortcuts on stuff and make it, you know, hey,

1081
01:07:04.72 --> 01:07:08.48
you'll be great if you do these three minutes. No, actually you won't. You need to do everything

1082
01:07:08.48 --> 01:07:12.24
out. You need to do the hard work. Yeah. And people buy into that. Why do they buy into that?

1083
01:07:12.24 --> 01:07:16.000
Because they want to take everyone wants to, they quick and easy, you know? I mean, people

1084
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.36
listen to this podcast don't. Yeah. No. People that are here, we want to get in the game fully.

1085
01:07:21.36 --> 01:07:26.56
Yeah. Two hours. Two hours in a book. Yes. Yeah. No shortcuts. No shortcuts. So

1086
01:07:26.56 --> 01:07:31.44
I think that's the difference. There's people, some people sell that and there's too many

1087
01:07:31.44 --> 01:07:37.52
people that buy into it. When what they should be buying is, hey, hard work and dedication and

1088
01:07:37.52 --> 01:07:43.84
discipline is what's going to meant to be prepared for me. Not this other stuff. Yeah. At the end.

1089
01:07:43.84 --> 01:07:49.28
Yeah. So yeah. So really, like I said, the SLP by technicality, it's a ritual, but here's a

1090
01:07:49.28 --> 01:07:54.000
thing about it being only technically a ritual. Because if you take that away,

1091
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.36
not necessarily the SLP because that has a full-on function, you know what?

1092
01:07:59.36 --> 01:08:03.12
To, I hate to cut you off just to talk about what we just, what we're talking about here, right?

1093
01:08:03.12 --> 01:08:06.56
Because because I said, hey, with the podcast and I've said this before, we have a ritual that

1094
01:08:06.56 --> 01:08:13.52
I do, you do it too. When I come, I brew the tea. I put my my pens in. I do the folder. I print

1095
01:08:13.52 --> 01:08:18.16
the stuff out. I have, I put the knives in the bag. I have a ritual that I go through. But to

1096
01:08:18.16 --> 01:08:24.08
case and point, case and point, that is not what prepares me for the, that's what happens. That is not

1097
01:08:24.08 --> 01:08:28.56
what prepares me for the recording. What prepares me for recording is what is spending 10 hours,

1098
01:08:29.28 --> 01:08:35.36
12 hours, 15 hours, diving into a book, looking upwards. I don't know, doing background studies on

1099
01:08:35.36 --> 01:08:39.12
battles that I don't understand that are mentioned all of a sudden, researching some general

1100
01:08:39.12 --> 01:08:44.40
that gets mentioned. That's what prepares me. That's what gets me in the mindset to record a podcast.

1101
01:08:44.40 --> 01:08:51.44
Not the ritual. The ritual doesn't actually mean anything without that core, deep preparation that's

1102
01:08:51.44 --> 01:08:55.68
done. That kind of settles our point here.

1103
01:08:55.68 --> 01:09:03.28
Yeah, I might know me very nicely. Yeah, I was going straight technical and you, I think you're

1104
01:09:03.28 --> 01:09:07.76
absolutely correct. And sometimes, because I would fall, especially when you're young, you're

1105
01:09:07.76 --> 01:09:12.08
like, just anything that'll help me, you know, like, do I did a time I shoes and the wrong,

1106
01:09:12.08 --> 01:09:15.44
like, superstition goes in there. You know, you know, that feeling where you're like,

1107
01:09:15.44 --> 01:09:19.20
dang, you're just stressed about something, so anything that'll help. And then after,

1108
01:09:19.20 --> 01:09:23.28
wow, you kind of go to your self, man, it doesn't matter what order I put my shoes on right now.

1109
01:09:23.28 --> 01:09:27.36
It doesn't matter what color my socks are, you know, you know, man, I used to have this thing where

1110
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.16
I'd be stressed to go to school for whatever it is, like intermediate skin when you're like a

1111
01:09:32.16 --> 01:09:36.08
newsglue. It's just a little bit stressed, not full on, but still I was looking for little things.

1112
01:09:36.08 --> 01:09:42.000
So, is this weird that you've been thinking about it and I'm so weird. So, I'd have, you know,

1113
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:49.60
music in your car on the tape. So, I liked Bushwick Bill, who's a rapper and get a boy. It's

1114
01:09:49.60 --> 01:09:55.20
anyway. No, I. So, and it had, you know, punch a swearing in it, but it was just a great, great

1115
01:09:55.20 --> 01:10:01.04
album. And I liked it. But I had it strangely in my mind, if I listen to like negative stuff,

1116
01:10:01.84 --> 01:10:06.000
I'd have a negative day. And some people might say, like, well, who's that's kind of true?

1117
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.04
But no, I don't think so. I think it doesn't matter really what music you look. Maybe my certain

1118
01:10:11.04 --> 01:10:16.48
music might put you in a certain mood, but that's up to you. Yeah, we're actually going in a whole

1119
01:10:16.48 --> 01:10:22.80
of the direction, which I'm fine. We're going there. I have always found that music to me,

1120
01:10:22.80 --> 01:10:30.000
like the words in the music, I'm barely registering what they are. I know them. I'll be,

1121
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:37.36
might even be singing along with them in my mind, but the words generally aren't having a huge

1122
01:10:37.36 --> 01:10:41.28
impact. I mean, I've listened to all kinds of rock and roll music throughout my years. If I would

1123
01:10:41.28 --> 01:10:47.52
follow a followed along with 10% of the lyrics, I would probably be a heroin addict in the other

1124
01:10:47.52 --> 01:10:51.92
somewhere, right? Because you can't just listen to music and obey what they say. And if you shouldn't

1125
01:10:51.92 --> 01:10:57.36
do that, most music is, a lot of music is negative, right? I mean, a lot of music is very negative

1126
01:10:57.36 --> 01:11:04.56
in what it's saying. So, yeah, that's what you're saying is the ritual of listening to the

1127
01:11:04.56 --> 01:11:10.40
right music is not important. No, not important at all. I'm just saying I used to like kind of,

1128
01:11:10.40 --> 01:11:15.28
I don't want to say fall for that trick, but I was young as an intermediate school. So you believe

1129
01:11:15.28 --> 01:11:18.88
it, you believe it. At the time, if you listen to negative music, you might have a negative negative

1130
01:11:18.88 --> 01:11:22.16
negative day. Yes, and not the kind, not the kind of where it's like, I'm going to listen to this

1131
01:11:22.16 --> 01:11:26.16
and then I choose to go, this will fire me up to do what it wasn't that. It was a superstition

1132
01:11:26.16 --> 01:11:30.88
is what it was. And I'm saying my point for the whole thing is you don't like how people like

1133
01:11:30.88 --> 01:11:36.64
basically hang their success or failure on some visualization or some ritual. Yes. And agree then,

1134
01:11:36.64 --> 01:11:43.92
that the point of making is, I would have to like remind myself of that. Like, man, the music,

1135
01:11:43.92 --> 01:11:48.72
like nothing bad is going to happen to me because I listen to Bushwick Bill talk about this thing.

1136
01:11:48.72 --> 01:11:52.96
I got you, that I will say this though. That is a conscious decision that you made,

1137
01:11:52.96 --> 01:11:58.40
you know, whereas if you were just listening, I mean, music changes your mood. Music changes my mood

1138
01:11:58.40 --> 01:12:03.36
for sure. Yeah. When I hear a certain music, I get a certain reaction to it and I will get into a certain

1139
01:12:03.36 --> 01:12:08.000
emotional state from listening to a song that's about something or not something else. You know,

1140
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:17.60
that will have an effect on me. Now, I don't know that my point is that the lyrics themselves

1141
01:12:17.60 --> 01:12:21.20
don't really mean anything. I guess I guess if they do mean something though and they hit me a

1142
01:12:21.20 --> 01:12:25.76
certain way, music definitely will put you in a different mood in my opinion. Yeah. If you let it

1143
01:12:25.76 --> 01:12:30.08
like if you're using it, if you're using it, if you're using it, well, I would say put you in a mood

1144
01:12:30.08 --> 01:12:34.40
unless you don't don't let it, because if you just listen to it, now there's times where you can

1145
01:12:34.40 --> 01:12:38.48
we listen to, you know, whatever music and it's just not going to hit you, but some music that you

1146
01:12:38.48 --> 01:12:44.88
have might have a core thought about. Now, does this go back and negate my earlier point that

1147
01:12:44.88 --> 01:12:50.48
music doesn't affect my mindset? Does that do it? Right? Now I'm going back on what I said,

1148
01:12:50.48 --> 01:12:55.36
because I said, oh, music doesn't affect your mindset. I guess I am going back on that. Well,

1149
01:12:55.36 --> 01:13:01.68
yeah, but ultimately, I think I think really it holds up where you, you look, because here's my deal.

1150
01:13:02.40 --> 01:13:07.28
Here's the deal. You're going into a stressful combat situation and you didn't get a chance to

1151
01:13:07.28 --> 01:13:12.40
listen to your song. Can you afford to be like, oh, no, I can't go. No, so that's another reason. Why,

1152
01:13:12.40 --> 01:13:17.44
yes, I'm staying with my original point. Yeah, I agree with you. Stick with that. Don't let anyone

1153
01:13:17.44 --> 01:13:21.28
sway you. Don't let them steal their original by a technicality, though.

1154
01:13:22.40 --> 01:13:27.76
Jocco. Is this question number five now? Yep. Can you speak about winning it

1155
01:13:29.04 --> 01:13:36.24
and when it's best to just go for it and when making a plan without time, do so is the best course?

1156
01:13:36.24 --> 01:13:45.36
Okay. Yeah, I can definitely talk about that. Well, winning it is never the first choice.

1157
01:13:45.36 --> 01:13:53.04
And when you see people in the, you know, in the seal teams or in the military,

1158
01:13:53.04 --> 01:13:58.32
if they're winning something, it's something that they've practiced a lot. If it's something

1159
01:13:58.32 --> 01:14:04.56
that they have planned broadly before and they've so much experience in that whatever that type of

1160
01:14:04.56 --> 01:14:09.52
operation that they can actually get away with it, right? And a good example, if you take a Jiu-Jitsu

1161
01:14:09.52 --> 01:14:15.84
example, like Dean Dean Lister, he can win it in a match. Jeff Glover can do that to a ridiculous level

1162
01:14:15.84 --> 01:14:22.56
of just winning it in competition and just show up and just do what he does because he's got, you know,

1163
01:14:23.04 --> 01:14:28.08
those guys at that high level have a mental fluidity that's going to be very helpful for them.

1164
01:14:28.08 --> 01:14:33.12
Now, there's other people that are very high level, Jiu-Jitsu players that don't win it,

1165
01:14:33.12 --> 01:14:39.92
that are very much more methodical. And I'm sure there's some cases with both Jeff and Dean

1166
01:14:39.92 --> 01:14:44.88
where they probably should have been more methodical. But I mean, Jeff is straight up suicidal

1167
01:14:44.88 --> 01:14:51.92
in many of his matches. I mean, and that's what's beautiful is, is that he moves so much so rapidly

1168
01:14:52.64 --> 01:14:58.32
that people can't hang with them on that level in most cases. So that's why he's, he's

1169
01:14:58.32 --> 01:15:04.96
winning it. Like every movement that he makes is winning it, but case and point, he's put himself

1170
01:15:04.96 --> 01:15:09.52
in those situations all the time. You come to the gym and watch him train, he's letting people

1171
01:15:09.52 --> 01:15:13.68
put him in the worst possible situations and figure it away out of it. So the reason he can

1172
01:15:13.68 --> 01:15:18.72
win it in the competitions because he's he's put in practice and discipline there in the background.

1173
01:15:18.72 --> 01:15:24.24
And if you saw my, you'll, you'll, you'll tune or task unit, we could win it on operations all the

1174
01:15:24.24 --> 01:15:30.56
time because we were prepared because we knew each other so well because we had standard operating

1175
01:15:30.56 --> 01:15:37.36
procedures that covered so much of the things that would happen during an operation where we would

1176
01:15:37.36 --> 01:15:42.32
be quote unquote winning it. So even though we're winning it, we're not really winning it because

1177
01:15:42.32 --> 01:15:47.92
we all all these standard, standard operating procedures in place that we didn't really need to plan.

1178
01:15:47.92 --> 01:15:56.08
But if you have time to plan, then of course plan do do as much planning as you can,

1179
01:15:56.08 --> 01:16:07.20
dig in and plan every detail that you can plan. Now, when it does come to planning, I think the most

1180
01:16:07.20 --> 01:16:15.12
important part of a plan, the thing that makes a plan the most effective is its flexibility

1181
01:16:15.12 --> 01:16:24.72
and making a plan that is so flexible that when you do the actual operation and you come up against

1182
01:16:24.72 --> 01:16:30.16
unexpected things which are absolutely going to happen, you have the flexibility, you have

1183
01:16:30.16 --> 01:16:38.08
options, you have contingency plans to deal with. Now, so plan as much as you can, but the problem is

1184
01:16:38.08 --> 01:16:43.68
with all that emphasis on planning, sometimes people become obsessed with planning.

1185
01:16:43.68 --> 01:16:48.96
And they plan and they plan and they plan to plan to plan and they plan to plan and they don't want

1186
01:16:48.96 --> 01:16:57.68
to execute and if they do execute, they execute late, they miss their opportunity. So that's why

1187
01:16:57.68 --> 01:17:01.44
that's why Pat and said I got this note written down here, Pat and said a good plan,

1188
01:17:01.44 --> 01:17:07.04
violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week, right? That's what

1189
01:17:07.04 --> 01:17:12.000
we're talking about. Come up with a good plan. Don't come up with a perfect plan that takes you

1190
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.08
two weeks to come up with. That's not going to help you. That's something you need to

1191
01:17:17.52 --> 01:17:20.88
keep in the front of your mind. And that is especially applicable in a

1192
01:17:21.76 --> 01:17:28.24
tactical decision that's being made in the field, right? Something that is unfolding. You see

1193
01:17:28.24 --> 01:17:33.28
the enemy maneuvering, you come up with a quick plan and you execute because every minute that you're

1194
01:17:33.28 --> 01:17:40.88
waiting to execute, the enemy is maneuvering on you. That that low in enemy fire, that's not

1195
01:17:40.88 --> 01:17:45.12
them retreating and running away. No, your mindset has to be that that's them maneuvering on you.

1196
01:17:45.12 --> 01:17:49.28
They're getting a better position. They're setting up getting ready to crush you so don't let

1197
01:17:49.28 --> 01:17:57.44
that happen. Make a plan and go and that comes back again to flexibility. If you come up with a good

1198
01:17:57.44 --> 01:18:04.32
plan and you go as that plan is being executed, you've got to pay attention. You've got to pay attention

1199
01:18:04.32 --> 01:18:09.28
and watch how it's unfolding. Don't put the blinders on and you've got your plan and now we're

1200
01:18:09.28 --> 01:18:12.96
going to go and we're not going to look around anymore. We're just going to follow the plan. No,

1201
01:18:12.96 --> 01:18:20.32
you have to be observant. You have to observe or you decide to act the whole time. You can't just

1202
01:18:20.32 --> 01:18:24.16
come up with a plan and stay on that track because when you come up with a fast plan, you're not

1203
01:18:24.16 --> 01:18:28.24
going to have thought about every single detail and you don't know what the enemy is going to do

1204
01:18:28.24 --> 01:18:33.12
anyways. You don't know what your competitor is going to do. You can't guarantee that. So when you see them

1205
01:18:33.12 --> 01:18:38.80
start to react to your what you executed, now you got to be ready to react yourself and get the

1206
01:18:38.80 --> 01:18:49.92
off the upper hand and take the offensive. So there's one more, there's one more little dichotomy to this

1207
01:18:51.44 --> 01:18:58.08
and I'll just say it. Even though I'm saying you've got to adapt your plan and you need to adjust

1208
01:18:58.72 --> 01:19:04.32
as things happen, you also want to stick to your plan. Those things are completely opposite of each other.

1209
01:19:04.32 --> 01:19:07.84
Right? I'm saying adapt and change your plan as needed, but I'm also telling you to stick to your plan.

1210
01:19:07.84 --> 01:19:15.92
But for instance, if you rehearsed a or if you have a standard operating procedure for your

1211
01:19:15.92 --> 01:19:22.16
order of patrol. So this is the order of the point man and it's it's Jones and then Smith

1212
01:19:22.16 --> 01:19:28.64
and then Washington and then Jefferson and that's your order patrol. Right? And those guys are always

1213
01:19:28.64 --> 01:19:33.28
marching in that order and so we know each other, we know how to work together, we have fire team

1214
01:19:33.28 --> 01:19:38.96
integrity, we have a standard operating procedure and we're going to attack a target. And when we

1215
01:19:38.96 --> 01:19:43.12
get closer to the target, we see that hey, you know what, maybe be better to move this guy over here

1216
01:19:43.12 --> 01:19:49.36
and move this guy over here and so let's change our standard order of March, our standard

1217
01:19:49.36 --> 01:19:58.16
patroling order because it'll it'll be easier when we get to the target. Don't do that. Don't do that.

1218
01:19:58.16 --> 01:20:03.84
You have your standard operating procedures for a reason. You have them and when you start

1219
01:20:03.84 --> 01:20:09.92
pulling yourself out of the standard operating procedures for no good reason. That's going to

1220
01:20:09.92 --> 01:20:18.24
come back and bite you. It's it's not going to work out good. So be flexible. This is going to

1221
01:20:18.24 --> 01:20:23.76
be an interesting statement. Be flexible, but stick to the plan, but be ready to do a just,

1222
01:20:23.76 --> 01:20:32.08
but stick to the plan. And that's totally contradictory. And I know that and I apologize,

1223
01:20:33.68 --> 01:20:38.08
but that is what leadership is. Leadership is balancing those dichotomies and leadership is knowing

1224
01:20:38.08 --> 01:20:41.84
when hey, we stayed with our standard operating procedure. We're going to hold through it through

1225
01:20:41.84 --> 01:20:45.76
this little thing right here. You know, there's been a little small terrain feature. We didn't

1226
01:20:45.76 --> 01:20:51.36
expect we could change our plan right now and adapt to that in an unlikely event that or the

1227
01:20:51.36 --> 01:20:58.16
small chance that something happens and will be better for at that moment. No, stay with your

1228
01:20:58.16 --> 01:21:03.28
standard operating procedure. But then when something dramatic happens and you need to make a change,

1229
01:21:03.28 --> 01:21:07.44
you do it aggressively, you do it dynamically. And then you continue to observe,

1230
01:21:07.44 --> 01:21:12.48
orientate, decide and act and stick, keep beating the enemy inside the Udalupe.

1231
01:21:16.08 --> 01:21:16.64
That's it.

1232
01:21:16.64 --> 01:21:21.76
Yeah. Next question.

1233
01:21:22.80 --> 01:21:23.92
Jockel. Yes.

1234
01:21:25.04 --> 01:21:35.12
An echo. B. JJ X partner is training in another gym. Now my head coach banned him from coming back.

1235
01:21:35.12 --> 01:21:44.24
Yeah. Question. So dojo loyalty versus freedom. Okay. What up?

1236
01:21:45.84 --> 01:21:52.16
So there is some tradition behind this actually. And the tradition is actually the

1237
01:21:52.16 --> 01:22:04.08
tradition of the crayon. So crayonchi is a Brazilian word and it's a name. Right? It's a name

1238
01:22:05.12 --> 01:22:11.76
from a character in a Brazilian soap opera. You're looking at me like you didn't know that. Did you know

1239
01:22:11.76 --> 01:22:15.92
this? I didn't know that. Oh, you didn't know this. I know crayonchi. Of course, everyone knows crayonchi.

1240
01:22:15.92 --> 01:22:22.24
Yeah. Jockel. crayonchi came from it's a character in a Brazilian soap opera that was like a

1241
01:22:23.28 --> 01:22:31.36
backstabber. Oh, I think. Look an unloyal guy. Right? And so when especially back in the early days

1242
01:22:31.36 --> 01:22:36.000
for me in Jockel, which was pretty early days in America for Jockel in the 90s,

1243
01:22:37.44 --> 01:22:42.88
if anyone was going from gym to gym or even left a gym permanently to go to another gym,

1244
01:22:42.88 --> 01:22:49.36
they were labeled this horrible word. It was the worst thing you could call somebody. Right?

1245
01:22:49.36 --> 01:22:54.80
Was a crayonchi. Okay. Yeah, this guy's a crayonchi. And that meant that they were a traitor.

1246
01:22:54.80 --> 01:23:01.04
Yeah. That's what it meant. And there's also, so that's there's a tradition of it in Jiu Jitsu,

1247
01:23:01.04 --> 01:23:06.80
right? Of this idea that if you change gyms or you train at a different place, you're a crayonchi.

1248
01:23:06.80 --> 01:23:12.72
Now, there's a little backlash against that. There's people that have, you know,

1249
01:23:13.28 --> 01:23:18.80
matter of fact, we used to joke about being like teen crayons. You know, training at different

1250
01:23:18.80 --> 01:23:24.08
places and trying to find the best places to train. But there's beyond that, there's a martial arts

1251
01:23:24.80 --> 01:23:32.000
kind of tradition as well, which is loyalty and gratitude to your instructor. Right? That's a

1252
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:38.40
fairly understood tradition, not just in the martial arts, but in any arena where you're

1253
01:23:38.40 --> 01:23:43.60
learning something from somebody that's putting their time and effort into you to instruct you

1254
01:23:43.60 --> 01:23:52.96
in something. And there's also a practical level of reasoning behind this. And that is

1255
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.20
competition. Yeah. Right? So if you're going to be competing and you compete with a guy at

1256
01:23:59.20 --> 01:24:06.56
your gym, that's got an unbelievable triangle. And then somebody else comes from another school

1257
01:24:06.56 --> 01:24:10.000
and they are basically rolling that guy and they see he's got a really good triangle. Now you're

1258
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.12
in a competition against that guy and he tells his buddy, hey, that guy, you're going to compete against

1259
01:24:13.12 --> 01:24:17.28
he has a really good triangle. Watch out for his triangle. That can change the outcome of a match.

1260
01:24:17.28 --> 01:24:21.04
Yeah, you know, the details of it. That can change the outcome of a match. So

1261
01:24:21.04 --> 01:24:29.76
there's a practical level to it. You know, there's also sharing moves, right? And if certain

1262
01:24:29.76 --> 01:24:34.40
schools might have a really good series of moves or moves and all of a sudden someone goes to,

1263
01:24:34.40 --> 01:24:38.32
you know, train somewhere else. They can share that move. And that's bad. And you know,

1264
01:24:38.32 --> 01:24:43.68
what's interesting is in every business, most businesses that I work with, I should say,

1265
01:24:44.80 --> 01:24:50.16
they have their own little worlds, right? And they have their own kind of loyalty and

1266
01:24:50.16 --> 01:24:56.40
crayon, and if you, if you're at, you pick an industry, people are good in that industry.

1267
01:24:56.40 --> 01:25:00.24
When they change companies, they bring with them the same kind of thing. They bring maybe

1268
01:25:00.24 --> 01:25:03.20
some secret sauce, maybe some moves, maybe they know some personalities. They know the

1269
01:25:03.20 --> 01:25:09.60
weakness of that other company. So when they leave, there's a loyalty factor that comes into it.

1270
01:25:09.60 --> 01:25:18.80
Now that being said, loyalty goes both ways. And I've talked about this before the student should be

1271
01:25:18.80 --> 01:25:24.08
loyal, right? But the teacher has to be loyal as well. That means they have to be teaching solid

1272
01:25:24.08 --> 01:25:28.56
stuff. That means they need to, you know, train correctly. That means they need to offer enough

1273
01:25:28.56 --> 01:25:34.08
classes. There's all kinds of things, right? They're the teacher owes some loyalty to the students.

1274
01:25:34.08 --> 01:25:43.28
And on top of that, on top of that, this is America. Right? This is America. And in America,

1275
01:25:43.28 --> 01:25:50.56
you pay to go to a school, you pay money, right? It cost you money. And I always use this example

1276
01:25:50.56 --> 01:25:58.32
when people ask me about this in America, just because you normally get your pizza from Domino's,

1277
01:25:59.12 --> 01:26:03.36
doesn't mean that if you feel like you can't call up little scissors and have some coming

1278
01:26:03.36 --> 01:26:08.16
because it's America. And if, and if, guess what, if little scissors makes a better pizza,

1279
01:26:08.16 --> 01:26:14.72
you're going to maybe order even more often. So it's there's competition, right? And you want

1280
01:26:14.72 --> 01:26:22.56
to end up where you get in the best pizza. And so there's some advantages to looking for that

1281
01:26:22.56 --> 01:26:26.56
good pizza. There's, there's, and there's some advantages to travel around and good training at

1282
01:26:26.56 --> 01:26:31.68
different places because you're going to get different schools with different instructors that

1283
01:26:31.68 --> 01:26:39.68
have different specialties and different styles. So that can be advantageous. There's also some

1284
01:26:39.68 --> 01:26:46.40
disadvantages to school, going to a bunch of different schools. Number one is your teacher doesn't

1285
01:26:46.40 --> 01:26:52.48
really know you. So now your teacher doesn't know your style, doesn't know what moves would be good for you.

1286
01:26:53.04 --> 01:26:57.04
They also don't see you progress because you're only coming back every once in a while or whatever.

1287
01:26:57.04 --> 01:27:02.72
They don't, they don't see you getting any better and they're not, they're not really

1288
01:27:02.72 --> 01:27:07.76
maybe as comfortable teaching you everything. Because you're not really their student. And you

1289
01:27:07.76 --> 01:27:13.44
know what, man, it is a, it's a, it's a powerful thing to teach someone to teach you. And then

1290
01:27:13.44 --> 01:27:18.48
and it's an effort. And there's an emotional component to it when you teach somebody to

1291
01:27:18.48 --> 01:27:23.76
teach you. There's an emotional thing. You're giving them something. Yeah. And there's an emotional

1292
01:27:23.76 --> 01:27:30.96
level in there somewhere that says, you know what, I'm giving you this. Not going to hold it over your

1293
01:27:30.96 --> 01:27:37.04
head, but you know, there's a little something there. You, I'm not going to say you owe me anything,

1294
01:27:37.04 --> 01:27:41.92
but you owe me a little something. Wait, wait, like, like, like, like, so I taught you this. So now

1295
01:27:41.92 --> 01:27:48.40
you need to go and not mess it up or you got to represent or is it like, don't use this to, I don't know,

1296
01:27:48.40 --> 01:27:55.12
I think it's a little bit of both of, you know, I'm investing all this in you, right? Sure,

1297
01:27:55.12 --> 01:28:00.88
you're giving me a hundred bucks a month. But what I'm giving you is worth more than a hundred

1298
01:28:00.88 --> 01:28:07.84
bucks a month, like we know that, right? So give me something back. What do I want back?

1299
01:28:07.84 --> 01:28:12.32
I want you to train with me. You know what I mean? Just, hey, you're going to go to another school

1300
01:28:12.32 --> 01:28:16.80
and you're going to train there sometimes. I understand that. But oh, wait a second. Now I'm

1301
01:28:16.80 --> 01:28:20.80
just your part-time teacher. Okay. Well, I'm not going to invest very much in you anymore.

1302
01:28:20.80 --> 01:28:28.16
Right. Yeah. So there's an emotional component to it. Now again, back to the advantages,

1303
01:28:28.16 --> 01:28:31.68
because there's a dichotomy of everything, right? You're wrong with different people at different

1304
01:28:31.68 --> 01:28:36.88
schools. Like I say, one thing that's nice about our schools, we got, we got different instructors

1305
01:28:36.88 --> 01:28:42.48
with different styles. I mean, between Dean and Jeff, they are literally at the opposite of the

1306
01:28:42.48 --> 01:28:47.68
spectrum, which is freaking awesome to have. They are the opposite of the spectrum of the

1307
01:28:47.68 --> 01:28:53.68
Gigi-Jitsu skill set, right? They're just crazy different. They almost don't look like they're

1308
01:28:53.68 --> 01:28:57.92
doing the same sport. And when I train with both of them, I don't feel like I'm doing the same

1309
01:28:57.92 --> 01:29:01.68
sport. It's just a different, it's just a totally different game. But then you got James

1310
01:29:02.72 --> 01:29:09.60
Nielsen, who's got his own style, Gigi-Jitsu, which is insane. Greg train, obviously. You got him

1311
01:29:09.60 --> 01:29:16.32
coming in hot. Who might miss an atom? He's teaching his own little different style. Who else? Jeff

1312
01:29:16.32 --> 01:29:23.76
Jeff Rial, Jeff Rial's got his badass game fast. Me, I don't know what, I don't teach myself,

1313
01:29:23.76 --> 01:29:28.40
but I'm sure that there's a different element there. Yeah, but you could coach up and stuff.

1314
01:29:28.40 --> 01:29:32.56
Like people learn from me. I know I, like a lot of stuff I learned from you, you know, and like

1315
01:29:32.56 --> 01:29:38.08
you're like a two, two-litch, whatever. You know, like you train with Jeff all the time,

1316
01:29:38.08 --> 01:29:41.76
you're going to learn some real creative dynamic stuff. You learn from Dean, you're going to

1317
01:29:41.76 --> 01:29:46.88
learn a lot of stuff like in, you know, in that way. So, so I think a lot of people still, even

1318
01:29:46.88 --> 01:29:52.56
that you're in that structure, they do learn a lot from you. Yeah, and I do teach from time to time,

1319
01:29:53.84 --> 01:29:58.64
but yes, I do and I do when I teach a lot of times when I am teaching, I might not be teaching the

1320
01:29:58.64 --> 01:30:03.84
glass, but I'm saying hey buddy, check this out. Yeah, put your hips over here, you know what?

1321
01:30:03.84 --> 01:30:08.24
So, so those are advantages. You know, for, and if you were at a school with one instructor,

1322
01:30:08.24 --> 01:30:13.52
yeah, then I could see where you'd be going, man. Okay, there could be an advantage if I go

1323
01:30:13.52 --> 01:30:19.20
try some other instructors. Again, there's a trade-off because now, now you start learning

1324
01:30:19.20 --> 01:30:26.64
something, I actually see this more with striking, with striking training, where guys that move

1325
01:30:26.64 --> 01:30:32.08
around from different coach different striking instructors a lot, they don't, it's not like

1326
01:30:32.08 --> 01:30:35.92
jiu-jitsu, where you can incorporate it in and you learn something from some other guy,

1327
01:30:35.92 --> 01:30:40.64
you bring it into your game and you change a little bit. When I see people move striking coaches

1328
01:30:40.64 --> 01:30:49.60
a lot, I see their game actually deteriorate in my opinion, because striking is more instinctive.

1329
01:30:49.60 --> 01:30:53.84
It's an instinctive thing, right? You're throwing your combos and you let them go. Like you let

1330
01:30:53.84 --> 01:30:59.92
your combos go and you react, it's, it's just something that happens. It's more mechanical. So,

1331
01:30:59.92 --> 01:31:04.56
when you train mechanically to react and to throw your combos the way you're throwing them,

1332
01:31:04.56 --> 01:31:07.36
and then all of a sudden you change that and you want to throw them a different way,

1333
01:31:07.36 --> 01:31:11.20
I think it trips people up. I think it sets them backwards a little bit. Whereas,

1334
01:31:11.20 --> 01:31:15.68
you're just so you can incorporate new games, different parts of games more fluidly.

1335
01:31:15.68 --> 01:31:20.80
And also striking when you're training, striking, you're just to show you learn moves from

1336
01:31:20.80 --> 01:31:27.60
the instructor, you learn some timing stuff, but it's like instruction, but then you have to

1337
01:31:27.60 --> 01:31:32.64
train with a multitude, like all your training murders, and that's part of your training.

1338
01:31:32.64 --> 01:31:37.20
So, if you go striking, it's not really like that. In fact, most strikers, they'll stick with

1339
01:31:37.20 --> 01:31:41.52
the one coach and then they'll have a multitude of sparring partners. Yes, that changes.

1340
01:31:41.52 --> 01:31:46.80
And you do to just buy it so nature is already like that. Yeah. When you

1341
01:31:46.80 --> 01:31:53.04
sparring in other people striking, though, your fundamental movements, they'll change a lot less

1342
01:31:53.04 --> 01:31:56.24
than they will when you're rolling, which is a different bunch of different people.

1343
01:31:56.24 --> 01:32:04.96
Yeah, you're just striking as linear. Yeah, and you're just too completely not linear.

1344
01:32:04.96 --> 01:32:08.88
So, therefore, when you're training something that's linear and you start going off that line,

1345
01:32:09.92 --> 01:32:15.44
it trips you up in my opinion. But would you do it, too? It can be beneficial at times to

1346
01:32:18.56 --> 01:32:21.92
train with some other people, advantages and disadvantages. So,

1347
01:32:21.92 --> 01:32:30.16
I guess to get to this question, long-winded answer. One, you know,

1348
01:32:31.44 --> 01:32:37.44
what is it? The head coach banned him from coming back. That's a bummer. That's a bummer.

1349
01:32:37.44 --> 01:32:44.08
I'm sorry to hear that. I've never banned anyone from our school for going and training in another

1350
01:32:44.08 --> 01:32:49.68
school. I'm not intimidated by that. Right? If someone goes, hey, I'm going to go train at

1351
01:32:49.68 --> 01:32:56.16
this on the school. I'm like, cool. And they come back because they get there and they go, okay,

1352
01:32:56.16 --> 01:33:00.64
this is cool, but I'm going to come back to where we get this training that we have a victory, right?

1353
01:33:00.64 --> 01:33:05.52
Which I'm comfortable with. And if someone goes somewhere and goes, oh, I like this place better than

1354
01:33:05.52 --> 01:33:11.84
victory, that's cool. Good luck. I mean, it's all, and, you know, in a year, they come back and go,

1355
01:33:11.84 --> 01:33:17.52
yeah, I'm coming back, you know? I don't get mad at them because everyone's on their own journey.

1356
01:33:17.52 --> 01:33:22.08
I guess you could say everyone's fine in their own path. And I'm not going to force people down a path.

1357
01:33:22.96 --> 01:33:26.96
I might recommend a path, you know? I might say, you know, and I do that. You know, that's what

1358
01:33:26.96 --> 01:33:31.84
this is we have the gym for. It's like, here's a path, man. And it's wide open. It's a beautiful path

1359
01:33:31.84 --> 01:33:38.72
with incredible jujitsu practitioners. So I don't, I'm kind of bummed out to hear, you know,

1360
01:33:38.72 --> 01:33:46.000
that that happens, but I do understand. I think that's what if I was, if I were in that position,

1361
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:51.04
where I'm at a school and my training partner leaves, and then he gets banned, that I don't like that.

1362
01:33:51.92 --> 01:33:57.36
I don't like that. Yeah. I think it's a bummer. Yeah, I think Saturai grew. And here,

1363
01:33:58.48 --> 01:34:03.04
everywhere is kind of different. Here is kind of a situation here in Southern California.

1364
01:34:03.04 --> 01:34:06.16
God, especially in the same day. In the same day. In the same day. In the same day. Yeah, we got the

1365
01:34:06.16 --> 01:34:10.96
jujitsu everywhere. Everywhere. Yes. So, and it's literally on every street corner in some games.

1366
01:34:10.96 --> 01:34:17.68
You can literally walk comfortably comfortably. It's like, what, one block to the next one. And it's

1367
01:34:17.68 --> 01:34:21.52
a good one too. That's the thing. Yeah. But it just goes everywhere. I'm sorry for those of you that live

1368
01:34:21.52 --> 01:34:27.20
in the non-jujitsu in the parks of the world. I'm sorry. We have a lot of jujitsu here in San Diego.

1369
01:34:27.20 --> 01:34:33.84
Yeah. We have like, our gym and Southern California in general, Orange County, LA is crazy. Yeah.

1370
01:34:33.84 --> 01:34:38.64
So you figure in San Diego what's going to kind of be a result of that is like,

1371
01:34:38.64 --> 01:34:45.76
all right, situation for example. We have Dean who's kind of the the main guy who kind of

1372
01:34:45.76 --> 01:34:50.56
came in with the school, right? Remember Dean had the small kind of school to the boxing club,

1373
01:34:50.56 --> 01:34:56.80
came to throw down is what it was called, became victory. But with Dean was like a bunch of guys like

1374
01:34:56.80 --> 01:35:03.84
for you, Elias, James Nils, Nilsin, some other guys from Fabio, Sanctose. And we all trained together.

1375
01:35:03.84 --> 01:35:08.56
Elias was in shock. They're like, all these guys. And then some guys went and opened their own school.

1376
01:35:08.56 --> 01:35:14.96
Now, so not as a result of that whole situation. Sure, we have other schools, but they're kind of

1377
01:35:14.96 --> 01:35:20.000
still aren't guys in a weird way. They're different. So if I go train with Elias, which I

1378
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.24
Johnny Furio, another one, you and my instructor for a little while, I'll go train with Johnny.

1379
01:35:24.24 --> 01:35:30.72
Sometimes. And then is that a, is that a fantasy situation? No. Yeah. I mean, even technically is that a

1380
01:35:30.72 --> 01:35:35.84
crowned situation. Oh, you're asking me technically. I would say, I would say this back 10 years ago.

1381
01:35:35.84 --> 01:35:41.36
Yeah. That would be a major crowned situation. Is it right now for me? No. Good. You know,

1382
01:35:41.36 --> 01:35:45.28
I want you to get better at your jiu-jitsu. Right. You know, and if if you got an opportunity to go,

1383
01:35:45.28 --> 01:35:49.52
you're going to retrain at another school. That's cool. Yeah. Because it's, it's going to make you

1384
01:35:49.52 --> 01:35:56.48
better. It doesn't, it doesn't offend me. You know what? I'm not a jealous husband. Right. I'm not jealous

1385
01:35:56.48 --> 01:36:02.24
of of that. I don't think, oh, what if he goes and never come, I know you. I know where it's at. Right.

1386
01:36:02.24 --> 01:36:07.76
And in, and so it's all good. You know, who I'm coming home to? That's right. That's right.

1387
01:36:08.96 --> 01:36:13.28
Well, I think the culture just in general is shifting. And I think this is this, like in

1388
01:36:13.28 --> 01:36:16.72
Southern California, it's going to be more like this, like, when we're laid back. Of course,

1389
01:36:16.72 --> 01:36:22.64
you get, you know, little, little tiny, little groups of people who still believe that, even though,

1390
01:36:22.64 --> 01:36:26.96
but the really the communities like that, in fact, if you consider studio 540, that's a

1391
01:36:26.96 --> 01:36:30.80
Korean-chik-jinim. Yes, it actually is. It's like, it is what we call the Korean-chik-jinim. Yeah,

1392
01:36:30.80 --> 01:36:35.20
capital. All the way down to the instructors, no, Fabio Santos to teach their one day. Fabio Santos

1393
01:36:35.20 --> 01:36:38.96
has his own gym, by the way. Arizona, yeah. By the way, same thing with the gigs, I call

1394
01:36:39.76 --> 01:36:44.000
these are guys who came from other academies. And they invite whoever, and they actually have other

1395
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.48
kind of other academy. You know, yeah, you can go, well, I visit all the time, you know, everyone knows each other.

1396
01:36:48.48 --> 01:36:54.48
So, yeah, the culture is different. And I think I think with our gym, it's not as, uh, not as

1397
01:36:54.48 --> 01:36:59.92
pronounced as that, but we definitely, I mean, people come in every day from, we're all over. You know,

1398
01:36:59.92 --> 01:37:04.88
how many daydives were represented today for Open Matt? There was guys from all over San Diego.

1399
01:37:04.88 --> 01:37:11.60
Guys from all over the country. Victor, showing up from Seattle, Trooper, want to get his game on,

1400
01:37:11.60 --> 01:37:17.36
right on, you know? I've been telling Mary, yeah, that's right. These go. These mode up there.

1401
01:37:17.36 --> 01:37:23.36
Yeah, he was good. And that's the cool thing. You said it Dean said it. He said, I encourage you to go to other gyms.

1402
01:37:23.36 --> 01:37:29.36
Or, I mean, not to be some weird spy. But he said, bro, if you want to go get training,

1403
01:37:29.36 --> 01:37:33.36
because I was going up to Eddie Bravillus. This was a long time ago when he was at, uh, like,

1404
01:37:33.36 --> 01:37:37.36
legends. And I was going up there for work, whatever. And, you know, I knew about that. Or it's like,

1405
01:37:37.36 --> 01:37:41.92
oh, is that kind of backstabbing if I go train? You didn't tell me that you were doing that.

1406
01:37:42.96 --> 01:37:46.16
Actually, I did. It wasn't about Eddie Bravillus, but it was about something else. I did tell you.

1407
01:37:46.16 --> 01:37:49.60
And he said the same thing. He was like, bro, you get as much training as you can.

1408
01:37:49.60 --> 01:37:54.72
Yeah. You know, if you want to, if you want to be a part of this association academy and whatever,

1409
01:37:54.72 --> 01:37:59.76
then that's up to you. And I'm glad you're here, whatever. And I don't think personally that you're going to do it.

1410
01:37:59.76 --> 01:38:04.16
But probably you're here to learn jujitsu. Yeah. And if you can learn some jujitsu over there,

1411
01:38:04.16 --> 01:38:08.96
like more of a certain type, then you can't hear or anywhere fine. Go do it. Yeah. He said the more

1412
01:38:08.96 --> 01:38:13.60
jujitsu you learn the better. So I was like Dean. Good. Good from Dean Lister right there. Yeah.

1413
01:38:13.60 --> 01:38:20.48
The more jujitsu you learn the better. Yeah. And then so even the kind of goal above and beyond that is

1414
01:38:22.24 --> 01:38:27.36
when you okay, you know what I got to interject here is especially for some of these academies out there.

1415
01:38:27.36 --> 01:38:33.04
Men jujitsu. It's like you're a doctor because you went through 10 years of school to get your black belt.

1416
01:38:33.04 --> 01:38:37.36
Just like a doctor was. And what sucks is when you're a doctor, you make X amount of money.

1417
01:38:37.36 --> 01:38:43.36
It's a very steady paycheck and you're kind of set. Jitsu doesn't mean anything. That black belt that

1418
01:38:43.36 --> 01:38:48.96
you worked 10 years for doesn't get you paid. So the reason I'm saying this is some of the people that

1419
01:38:48.96 --> 01:38:54.96
are more defensive about this. If they're an instructor, they have a small academy. They need

1420
01:38:55.84 --> 01:38:59.76
they you're financially supporting them. They weren't hard to do that. They've invested in you.

1421
01:38:59.76 --> 01:39:03.52
They counting on you. So when you just go, oh, you know, I'm going to go train somewhere else. That

1422
01:39:03.52 --> 01:39:08.000
that not only does it hurt them emotionally like I said. Because man, when you put some effort into

1423
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.96
somebody, you feel like, oh, you're going to leave after I gave you all that. And you didn't give it

1424
01:39:12.96 --> 01:39:17.52
to them because you they paid, but you gave them the value that you get out of Jitsu is not worth

1425
01:39:17.52 --> 01:39:24.16
$100 a month. It's worth $1,000 a month. It's worth a ton of money. Killing put that on his

1426
01:39:25.04 --> 01:39:29.52
on on some social media post that he because he got his black belt. You and when he did he's like,

1427
01:39:29.52 --> 01:39:34.24
well, you're rich when you got something that money can't buy. And that's the truth, right? And

1428
01:39:34.24 --> 01:39:39.04
but that black belt doesn't get you any money. It doesn't mean anything. So there's another

1429
01:39:39.04 --> 01:39:44.88
component to this whole thing that if you're leaving and going to different schools and someone's

1430
01:39:44.88 --> 01:39:49.12
thinking, oh man, I'm going to lose, you know, this is how I feed my there's you know, Jitsu is

1431
01:39:49.12 --> 01:39:52.88
you want to become a Jitsu instructor. You're generally not going to become a rich person, right?

1432
01:39:52.88 --> 01:40:01.28
Not financially rich. So there's that component too. Now luckily, we have a big gym and it's a little

1433
01:40:01.28 --> 01:40:08.40
easier for guys to come and go. It's okay. You know, we're not sweating it as bad. And yeah,

1434
01:40:08.40 --> 01:40:14.48
so you got to keep that mind as well that your your coach that's poured more than what you've paid

1435
01:40:14.48 --> 01:40:18.08
him. Yeah, because I don't just want to say, hey, look, I'm paying for this instruction. So you

1436
01:40:18.08 --> 01:40:24.56
owe it to me and I'll go do whatever I want. That's too base of a statement to make. You're truly

1437
01:40:24.56 --> 01:40:29.20
Jitsu has more value than the hundred dollars a month. Yeah, you're paying for it. Yeah, and you really

1438
01:40:29.20 --> 01:40:33.52
as a quote unquote customer or member, I mean, I was there, they're sure there's exceptions

1439
01:40:33.52 --> 01:40:39.20
this, but generally you don't want that anyway, even if you think you do like I can be free to

1440
01:40:39.20 --> 01:40:43.12
come and go and technically you are free to come and go as you as you are, but don't think that

1441
01:40:43.12 --> 01:40:48.32
like everyone's going to be just hundred percent fine with it all the time because when when you

1442
01:40:48.32 --> 01:40:55.28
when you come in like I said like it's a kind of a two way street, you are hopefully I hope my coach

1443
01:40:55.28 --> 01:41:01.12
takes pride in what he taught me first. I hope my coach is like I care about how good you become,

1444
01:41:01.12 --> 01:41:06.88
for sure. I hope he's not that I who said give me the check, I'll teach my moves and who cares

1445
01:41:06.88 --> 01:41:12.000
about how good you get and I don't want that guy. You don't want that guy. Yep. So there is that and

1446
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.72
and so that makes sense is it is that too ish street, but as a competitor or practitioner

1447
01:41:16.72 --> 01:41:21.60
guy learning, so that's a student, especially when you reach a certain level and you've been training

1448
01:41:21.60 --> 01:41:26.96
with kind of the same even like 20, 25 guys will say you've been training with these same 20,

1449
01:41:26.96 --> 01:41:30.88
which is a lot of guys by the way, don't we strain with you've been training with them for I don't

1450
01:41:30.88 --> 01:41:37.04
know whatever eight years we'll say. And then you go to another gym man that's a way different look.

1451
01:41:37.04 --> 01:41:42.08
So it's like fresh brand new types of training. Oh it's like you're almost going to competition,

1452
01:41:42.08 --> 01:41:44.72
but you're not competing because when you compete you get to go against people you've never

1453
01:41:44.72 --> 01:41:49.68
trained with before. Yeah, different guys and that's aside from even the different

1454
01:41:49.68 --> 01:41:53.44
techniques. You know what I find when I go in those situations when I train with somebody that

1455
01:41:53.44 --> 01:41:58.08
doesn't that don't train with all the time? You feel a lot better at your jitsu because they don't

1456
01:41:58.08 --> 01:42:05.68
know your game and you know everyone's got their own little special thing. So I always feel like

1457
01:42:05.68 --> 01:42:10.08
a little bit better when I go. Yeah see and that's part of my point where if you train with 25

1458
01:42:10.08 --> 01:42:15.44
guys those 25 guys they know your game and not to say it's not good training but they know your

1459
01:42:15.44 --> 01:42:22.08
game so it may not be as accurate as far as like competition or something like that after a while.

1460
01:42:22.08 --> 01:42:26.88
So when you go to these new places you get that's an additional layer of training you get. Yeah

1461
01:42:26.88 --> 01:42:30.72
you know another subject on this is it kind of always bummed me out when I would hear from my

1462
01:42:30.72 --> 01:42:36.000
jitsu friends that have we've been in San Diego for 20 something years and all of a sudden be like

1463
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000
oh we can't come to your school because our instructor doesn't want us to and our health is

1464
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:46.16
be like bro. So so that's like I wouldn't tell somebody that. I'm not trying to control people

1465
01:42:47.04 --> 01:42:54.000
and it bumps me out. So that actually brings up another subject that I feel like I have to talk

1466
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.64
about because we got a lot of people out there that are starting jiu-jitsu for the first time.

1467
01:42:58.64 --> 01:43:04.24
A lot of troopers that are getting in the jiu-jitsu game which is awesome. It's awesome and I get a

1468
01:43:04.24 --> 01:43:09.52
lot of people saying oh what school should I train at in wherever throw a dart at a map in America

1469
01:43:09.52 --> 01:43:13.52
and that's what they're asking me about. First of all I don't know all those instructors now

1470
01:43:13.52 --> 01:43:19.84
generally you know somebody that does jiu-jitsu will look at a website and see what a guy's credentials

1471
01:43:19.84 --> 01:43:24.88
are and say yeah that guy looks like a legit black belt or legit brown belt or even a guy asked me

1472
01:43:24.88 --> 01:43:29.52
their day is it worth learning from a purple belt if there's no one else around him like absolutely

1473
01:43:29.52 --> 01:43:35.12
absolutely. So but people ask me about these schools and I kind of give them my best guess like

1474
01:43:35.12 --> 01:43:40.24
you know I'll take a look at the website and you know see if there's a black belt you don't need to

1475
01:43:40.24 --> 01:43:46.80
ask me by the way Google look at their record make sure that they do Brazilian jiu-jitsu not some

1476
01:43:46.80 --> 01:43:54.24
other form of jiu-jitsu just just you can figure it out you don't need you can go to the school

1477
01:43:54.24 --> 01:43:59.36
and assess but what I want the main point that I wanted to bring up isn't that it's just this part here

1478
01:43:59.36 --> 01:44:09.20
is that being into jiu-jitsu doesn't mean that a person is a good person and being a black belt

1479
01:44:09.20 --> 01:44:19.44
in jiu-jitsu doesn't have anything to do with their character as a person and I hate to say that

1480
01:44:21.28 --> 01:44:28.88
and there is a level of to get to be a black belt in jiu-jitsu sure you could say in general it means

1481
01:44:28.88 --> 01:44:34.32
you're a committed person in general it means you're a hardworking person in general it means

1482
01:44:34.32 --> 01:44:43.04
that you've been humbled by your experiences on the map in general but it is no way a fact and

1483
01:44:43.92 --> 01:44:54.64
there are people in the jiu-jitsu game that are swindlers and thieves and they're untrustworthy

1484
01:44:54.64 --> 01:45:02.96
and there's black belts in jiu-jitsu that can be bullies and there's people in jiu-jitsu that can be

1485
01:45:02.96 --> 01:45:12.80
predators and you know jiu-jitsu it's a power and sometimes people that are power hungry

1486
01:45:12.80 --> 01:45:21.84
recognize that power and they pursue the gaining of jiu-jitsu power and then they abuse that power

1487
01:45:22.64 --> 01:45:31.92
so like any abusive situation where one person has a perceived power over another person it can

1488
01:45:31.92 --> 01:45:37.20
get very ugly and there's all kinds of abuses that I've seen take place over the years in a

1489
01:45:37.20 --> 01:45:47.76
jiu-jitsu world financial abuses physical abuse and even sexual abuse so I just wanted to

1490
01:45:48.56 --> 01:45:57.60
get that out there that being a jiu-jitsu black belt brown belt purple belt blue belt white

1491
01:45:57.60 --> 01:46:05.52
belt doesn't make someone a good person so you need to be careful jiu-jitsu doesn't make you

1492
01:46:05.52 --> 01:46:12.08
god and it certainly doesn't make you a saint but it does give you power and everybody has to recognize

1493
01:46:12.08 --> 01:46:19.68
that there's people out there that are their goal is to abuse power and I think the same thing goes

1494
01:46:19.68 --> 01:46:25.92
with any glorified position in life you know and I actually see that sometimes with you know

1495
01:46:25.92 --> 01:46:33.52
a standing in a company a being a veteran like being a veteran doesn't mean that you're a saint

1496
01:46:33.52 --> 01:46:38.96
by any stretch the imagination being a seal right I know a lot of seals there's plenty of seals

1497
01:46:38.96 --> 01:46:46.16
they got out of the suit teams and they're upstanding awesome citizens but there's also

1498
01:46:46.16 --> 01:46:55.68
scoundrels and miscreants and swindlers like I said and they're using the seal name that they have

1499
01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:03.52
to promote themselves and to take advantage of other people so keep your guard up keep your guard up

1500
01:47:03.52 --> 01:47:12.000
and make sure you judge people not based on what jiu-jitsu belt they have or what veteran status it is

1501
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:20.08
that they brag about but who they are as a person and I just wanted to get that out there

1502
01:47:21.12 --> 01:47:27.28
because we sit here and talk about jiu-jitsu and there's so many great people in jiu-jitsu men it's

1503
01:47:27.28 --> 01:47:31.84
wonderful you roll into some say you see somebody with cauliflower ears and you start talking

1504
01:47:31.84 --> 01:47:36.40
to him it's great and you you know there's just a bunch of great people I mean we're on the

1505
01:47:36.40 --> 01:47:42.40
mat today for two hours you know and we train for hour and fifteen minutes and they were just hanging

1506
01:47:42.40 --> 01:47:46.56
out just talking because that's what we do and we're talking about everything and it's so there's

1507
01:47:46.56 --> 01:47:56.56
great people in jiu-jitsu it's a great family situation but you do have to be careful it is not a blanket

1508
01:47:59.92 --> 01:48:04.96
blanket statement that's because someone's a jiu-jitsu black belt for instance that they are

1509
01:48:04.96 --> 01:48:11.20
out trustworthy person because there's some scumbags out there yeah and in that that can and the fact

1510
01:48:11.20 --> 01:48:16.80
that and I talked to Brady about this everyone's somewhere you go in jiu-jitsu and it seems like

1511
01:48:16.80 --> 01:48:21.52
everyone just identifies with each other and later on you find out oh shoot that guy's like a lawyer and

1512
01:48:21.52 --> 01:48:25.68
that guy's a doctor or that guy's like a different really nice guy's a woman and that guy's a

1513
01:48:25.68 --> 01:48:30.56
whatever and this person's from this area and we all to get along on it. Yep everyone gets along

1514
01:48:30.56 --> 01:48:36.08
in the black belt he has so much like he's on board like for the most part it's pretty pretty

1515
01:48:37.28 --> 01:48:43.12
everyone's really good in jiu-jitsu for the most part right and that's why you can kind of especially

1516
01:48:43.12 --> 01:48:47.28
if you're kind of new or maybe like the first year or something like that where you're going around

1517
01:48:47.28 --> 01:48:51.28
and dang my whole year of jiu-jitsu has been great people come on the mat and they're oh my gosh

1518
01:48:51.28 --> 01:48:55.44
she's all my new friends that's a big one man all my new friends is so cool and I got this whole

1519
01:48:55.44 --> 01:48:59.36
thing it's like it's your whole life is better and then so your guard is down in the in a

1520
01:48:59.36 --> 01:49:04.000
calm it's like a conditioning way you're just like hey if you're in jiu-jitsu you must be dope

1521
01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.88
in every way and then you get these like outliers that they're in the game you know and they

1522
01:49:08.88 --> 01:49:14.24
and they take advantage like they're where they can you know and some do but yeah you got to

1523
01:49:14.24 --> 01:49:18.48
you got to always kind of watch out for that guy yeah so just if your spider senses are going up

1524
01:49:18.48 --> 01:49:23.36
or first of all turn them on yeah turn them on turn them on and if they go up start to

1525
01:49:23.36 --> 01:49:27.60
maybe ask more questions and you are and don't get yourself in a situation where you know

1526
01:49:27.60 --> 01:49:32.48
you're going to regret what's going on because you believed that someone was a good person because

1527
01:49:32.48 --> 01:49:38.40
they had some status that you considered to be an honorable status you know hate to say it man I hate

1528
01:49:38.40 --> 01:49:44.24
to I hate to have to uh kind of bring that bring all that all that jiu-jitsu down in this you know

1529
01:49:44.24 --> 01:49:48.72
there's and it I'll tell you something else there's aspects of jiu-jitsu where people lose their minds

1530
01:49:48.72 --> 01:49:54.72
right they get crazy and you know some of it you know with the whole school thing we just talked about

1531
01:49:54.72 --> 01:50:02.40
where people start going crazy about who owns students right now like you know like I'm on

1532
01:50:02.40 --> 01:50:08.56
own any students yeah I'm happy to have people that train at my gym and I'm happy to work with them

1533
01:50:08.56 --> 01:50:13.44
and train them well I don't know own anybody right and there's people that get that crazy

1534
01:50:13.44 --> 01:50:21.92
there's people that get crazy parents that go psycho on their kids and go level seven you know

1535
01:50:21.92 --> 01:50:27.84
um living vicariously through their kids and push their kids till their kids hate jiu-jitsu

1536
01:50:27.84 --> 01:50:32.40
yeah and I'll tell you I push my kids too hard when they were younger for sure that's looking back

1537
01:50:32.40 --> 01:50:36.000
you know if it's the big parenting advice from jockel man I push my kids too hard I made him

1538
01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.80
compete too much made him compete in harder brackets older kids have your kids all the time

1539
01:50:40.80 --> 01:50:48.08
and it made jiu-jitsu not fun you know but I didn't break them mentally from that

1540
01:50:48.08 --> 01:50:54.96
so you gotta be careful that you gotta be careful of the whole um you gotta be careful of jiu-jitsu is a

1541
01:50:54.96 --> 01:51:00.08
power and it's really easy to get suckered into the point where you feel like you should

1542
01:51:00.08 --> 01:51:06.32
exercise your power over other people um on the mats or otherwise you know if you if you ever

1543
01:51:06.32 --> 01:51:11.20
go into the gym and it's making you feel really good to tap everyone out like you're feeling

1544
01:51:11.20 --> 01:51:16.32
better than them just just start to check yourself man because that's not that's not helping you

1545
01:51:16.32 --> 01:51:20.40
because there's someone out there that's can tap you there's someone else and if you're

1546
01:51:20.40 --> 01:51:26.80
taking those abusive out on other people so again to be genders in jiu-jitsu you're gonna get

1547
01:51:26.80 --> 01:51:33.12
tapped out you're gonna get tapped out a lot but there shouldn't be anyone that is smashing

1548
01:51:33.12 --> 01:51:37.36
you and abusing you that's a much higher belt than you right you know another white belt might not

1549
01:51:37.36 --> 01:51:41.92
even get that yet they're just happy they're submitting you right but when you want that's been

1550
01:51:41.92 --> 01:51:49.92
around a little bit more they should be you you should feel like hey that guy just he didn't abuse

1551
01:51:49.92 --> 01:51:56.56
me yeah she didn't abuse me she just beat me and I know what happened and it's cool yeah and

1552
01:51:57.52 --> 01:52:02.72
even that that's what kind of weird and interesting too where abuse can come in weird different

1553
01:52:02.72 --> 01:52:08.72
forms too you know like if because there's a difference in okay so like Jeff Glover for example

1554
01:52:08.72 --> 01:52:13.36
if you if Jeff Glover is because he has fun when he rolls that's a big part of his his game

1555
01:52:14.08 --> 01:52:18.24
and let's say oh I'm a new white belt maybe you know and I come and roll against Jeff

1556
01:52:18.24 --> 01:52:22.56
Glover and heat and let's let's say it's a I don't know six minute round and just in training and

1557
01:52:22.56 --> 01:52:30.08
Jeff taps him out 25 times that's not that's not abuse you know you just need to do

1558
01:52:30.08 --> 01:52:34.24
some missions hold on you he's doing his thing or whatever if someone's like grinding you and

1559
01:52:34.24 --> 01:52:38.000
doing you know abusing you or trying to make you look stupid or something like that

1560
01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.36
because like oh yeah I know you just see you don't kind of thing or maybe there's some girls

1561
01:52:41.36 --> 01:52:48.24
that he's trying to press then that starts to get into abuse but don't ever watch me in being

1562
01:52:48.24 --> 01:52:52.32
roll because one of us is having a good day and the other one's having a bad day it's straight up

1563
01:52:52.32 --> 01:52:57.44
abuse but that's you in being and and you'll notice that if you when you establish like

1564
01:52:57.44 --> 01:53:02.40
solid training partners right that becomes part of the game I'm gonna try to abuse you and so

1565
01:53:02.40 --> 01:53:07.36
that's different that's what I mean by so different like dynamic as far as like

1566
01:53:07.36 --> 01:53:12.88
recognizing what abuse is because if you get tapped out 25 times and it seems like dang you didn't

1567
01:53:12.88 --> 01:53:18.32
have to like go black belt on him he's a white belt well yeah he went black belt on him but he

1568
01:53:18.32 --> 01:53:23.28
wasn't abusing on you know I mean that's like that that's well within the confines of the game for

1569
01:53:23.28 --> 01:53:27.36
show for sure there's a big difference between that I know this to translate this for people

1570
01:53:27.36 --> 01:53:36.08
I don't do jiu-jitsu yet think about also this with any status structure right in the work

1571
01:53:36.08 --> 01:53:43.60
in the military in in the hierarchy of any company or industry where if you're feeling good

1572
01:53:44.72 --> 01:53:50.88
about bossing people around yeah you're doing something wrong man you're doing something wrong

1573
01:53:50.88 --> 01:54:02.08
if you're goal of what you're doing is based on you if you're saying look I'm gonna be the best

1574
01:54:02.08 --> 01:54:10.56
and I'm gonna be this is what's important to me yeah if that's what you're saying is a leader

1575
01:54:11.28 --> 01:54:17.68
put yourself in check because that's just pure ego coming out when you're saying look I want to be the

1576
01:54:17.68 --> 01:54:22.56
best in this and I think there's a weird thing that happens with people that are go getters and they

1577
01:54:22.56 --> 01:54:26.56
hear someone that's a go getter they'll hear some person that's been successful in business and

1578
01:54:26.56 --> 01:54:30.72
that person that's been successful in business will be like you know what I said I was gonna be the

1579
01:54:30.72 --> 01:54:34.56
best and here I am on the best and you've got to set your goals you've got to put them out there

1580
01:54:34.56 --> 01:54:37.36
and you've got to let everyone know that you're gonna run them over if you're getting your way

1581
01:54:37.36 --> 01:54:45.12
and that sounds really cool and and I guarantee if you went back and you followed that person

1582
01:54:45.12 --> 01:54:51.92
through their career they were not like that they were they were politically sensitive they

1583
01:54:51.92 --> 01:54:56.08
understood other people's needs they didn't go hey nice to meet you I'm gonna take over this

1584
01:54:56.08 --> 01:54:59.44
business no they didn't do that they said hey nice to meet you how you doing what are

1585
01:54:59.44 --> 01:55:04.64
we trying to make happen here they made it a goal for the team even if the deep underlying goal

1586
01:55:04.64 --> 01:55:12.56
is a is a selfish one let's say the outer goal should not be that it should not be hey

1587
01:55:12.56 --> 01:55:18.88
I'm gonna be the best I'm gonna be the ruler of this company I'm gonna be no we don't want to hear

1588
01:55:18.88 --> 01:55:23.28
that like when you you know you just take all I want to be the president of the United States

1589
01:55:23.92 --> 01:55:27.44
who wants that person to be president of the United States and I sure don't I don't want that

1590
01:55:27.44 --> 01:55:33.20
person in the president of the United States if someone says I'm gonna be the CEO of this company

1591
01:55:33.20 --> 01:55:39.04
now what do you think of that you think okay so this person's ego is really really big

1592
01:55:39.04 --> 01:55:43.84
and you think yourself you know what that I don't like that you need to put that so if that's

1593
01:55:43.84 --> 01:55:50.88
your attitude and you think you're being fired up keep that goal internal don't be announcing

1594
01:55:50.88 --> 01:55:54.64
that goal you know such state your goals and let the world know you're here no

1595
01:55:54.64 --> 01:56:00.96
goal because you sound like an ego maniac what you should say is like you know what I want to do

1596
01:56:00.96 --> 01:56:06.88
with this company I want to help this company grow the best I can and you know what's important to

1597
01:56:06.88 --> 01:56:10.48
be about being in a leadership position what's important to me about being in a leadership position

1598
01:56:10.48 --> 01:56:16.72
is making sure that the people underneath me they get better and they reach their goals this isn't

1599
01:56:16.72 --> 01:56:24.000
about me this is about the people that are on my team and I want to make them successful now who

1600
01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:29.92
wants to work for that person I do sign me up but when I say hey boss night to nice to meet you what

1601
01:56:29.92 --> 01:56:35.60
you're you know what what your goal here at the company my goal is to be CEO yeah to be the boss so

1602
01:56:35.60 --> 01:56:40.40
you're gonna step on my back to get there sounds like fun don't sign me up for that guy now I don't

1603
01:56:40.40 --> 01:56:45.12
want to work with that person I want to work with somebody that's about the team and I don't want

1604
01:56:45.12 --> 01:56:47.92
to work with somebody that's gonna be abusive just like I don't want to train anybody's

1605
01:56:47.92 --> 01:56:54.48
GJ2 Academy that's gonna have that abusive mentality and they're out there so I wanted to tie that

1606
01:56:54.48 --> 01:57:00.08
back into the business world I'm the instructor I'm the instructor I'm the instructor I'm your instructor

1607
01:57:00.08 --> 01:57:05.28
you don't go no it's like a Napoleon Dynamite you know about your sensei right they they make fun of that

1608
01:57:05.28 --> 01:57:09.20
and it's funny and and there's I'm not seeing there's anything wrong with that there's a lot of

1609
01:57:09.20 --> 01:57:13.52
tradition in GJ2 as well you know you bow to your instructor you bow when you come on and off the

1610
01:57:13.52 --> 01:57:19.28
map yeah that's not super into that stuff you know what I mean I'm laid back you know I'm pretty

1611
01:57:19.28 --> 01:57:24.24
laid back when it comes to the GJ2 traditions yeah most of the bowing to the instructor in GJ2 is

1612
01:57:24.24 --> 01:57:30.08
more like it's like bow to GJ2 almost like and that bow like bow down it's more it's like show

1613
01:57:30.08 --> 01:57:35.04
respect like if you go to even more traditional schools even when Marango was teaching at our

1614
01:57:35.04 --> 01:57:40.000
school you know you bow to all the instructors because they're the ones providing the GJ2 and then

1615
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.84
you bow to Helio Gracie because he's the one who kind of provide you know so it's more about

1616
01:57:43.84 --> 01:57:48.40
that you GJ2 yeah yeah not like bow to your shins it doesn't have that feel and you're going to

1617
01:57:48.40 --> 01:57:54.24
make sure that you're not getting that crossover where it goes from hey bow to GJ2 and play

1618
01:57:54.24 --> 01:57:59.84
pay respect to a beautiful thing to bow to me yes and it's the same thing in the business world

1619
01:57:59.84 --> 01:58:04.56
if you're saying look there's nothing wrong with treating your CEO with respect and your CEO

1620
01:58:04.56 --> 01:58:08.80
should be treated with respect or your boss you treat your boss with respect absolutely

1621
01:58:08.80 --> 01:58:12.16
like hey boss what do you need me to do hey hey sir in the military you know you call those senior

1622
01:58:12.16 --> 01:58:17.60
officers sir there's there's there's nothing you shouldn't feel degraded by doing that but

1623
01:58:19.44 --> 01:58:25.68
if for instance in the military if it's like hey you call me sir you know okay I see what I'm

1624
01:58:25.68 --> 01:58:32.80
dealing with here in the in the business world if people are you know if you as an individual

1625
01:58:32.80 --> 01:58:39.28
are thinking you better show me the respect I deserve you got issues you got issues you got

1626
01:58:39.28 --> 01:58:43.20
issues you got to earn that respect if someone's not giving you respect don't don't look at them

1627
01:58:43.20 --> 01:58:49.28
and demand it yeah look at yourself and demand that you become a better leader where they give

1628
01:58:49.28 --> 01:58:55.60
you the respect not because you asked for it but because you deserved it yeah there's a big difference

1629
01:58:55.60 --> 01:59:01.12
that's funny man give me the respect I deserve give me the respect I most of the time most

1630
01:59:01.12 --> 01:59:05.68
Donald time most of them one someone says give me the respect I deserve it's when they are

1631
01:59:05.68 --> 01:59:10.24
being given the respect that these are which is probably not most of the time when people are

1632
01:59:10.24 --> 01:59:14.88
being saying give me the respect I deserve they don't deserve the respect they're asking for

1633
01:59:16.24 --> 01:59:21.28
they need to get their head together also where we got time for one more that's one

1634
01:59:21.28 --> 01:59:30.40
juggle I had had a few rough months some setbacks at work that hurt me financially which

1635
01:59:30.40 --> 01:59:35.12
is stressed out my family I'm late on some payments I'm falling further behind at work

1636
01:59:36.16 --> 01:59:39.76
I don't want to tap out but I just don't know where to start

1637
01:59:40.88 --> 01:59:47.28
well you know what that's that's just kind of the way that

1638
01:59:47.28 --> 01:59:58.16
life works sometimes it's it's Murphy's law when things go wrong they always seem to happen

1639
01:59:58.16 --> 02:00:07.92
at once and they just compound on top of each other and it's it's pretty easy sometimes to

1640
02:00:07.92 --> 02:00:15.20
to feel beaten when you're faced with all those issues and all those problems and they all hit you

1641
02:00:15.20 --> 02:00:29.52
at the same time but let me tell you that that doesn't mean give up in fact it means the opposite

1642
02:00:31.12 --> 02:00:39.76
it means it's time for you to fight harder to dig in means it's time for you to go on the war path

1643
02:00:39.76 --> 02:00:48.88
and that starts with one of the fundamental laws of combat leadership prioritize next

1644
02:00:48.88 --> 02:00:56.24
acute what's the biggest problem well what's causing the most stress family okay

1645
02:00:57.12 --> 02:01:07.44
sit them down explain where you are at be blunt be upfront and then give them the simple plan of

1646
02:01:07.44 --> 02:01:15.60
how you're going to get things back on track don't sugar code it you give it to them straight

1647
02:01:16.80 --> 02:01:26.08
next you got some some late payments call those creditors up explain to them what's going on set up

1648
02:01:26.08 --> 02:01:33.20
some kind of a of a minimum payment plan so you can start making some progress and get them off

1649
02:01:33.20 --> 02:01:42.24
your back and then you got your job right you're following behind at work okay talk to your boss

1650
02:01:43.52 --> 02:01:49.84
face it tell him that you're going to step up your game tell him you're going to be at work early

1651
02:01:49.84 --> 02:01:53.92
you're going to be at work late you're going to be at work during lunch you're going to be wherever you

1652
02:01:53.92 --> 02:02:01.60
need to be whenever he needs you to be there tell him you're going to get after it and tell him

1653
02:02:01.60 --> 02:02:10.24
that you're a hundred percent committed to supporting him and the company and the mission

1654
02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:24.32
and then you get started and I'm going to tell you right now it won't be easy it will be hard

1655
02:02:24.32 --> 02:02:34.40
because life is hard that's what life is and these challenges these challenges that you face

1656
02:02:35.84 --> 02:02:48.40
they're going to do their best to take you down do not let them stand up dig in

1657
02:02:48.40 --> 02:02:59.68
line up those problems and confront them face them fight them do not let them bring you down

1658
02:03:00.24 --> 02:03:14.08
in fact in fact let those challenges raise you up let them elevate you let their demands and their

1659
02:03:14.08 --> 02:03:26.32
trials make you stronger let the adversity you face today turn you into a better person tomorrow

1660
02:03:29.12 --> 02:03:37.92
so so in the future you look back at these struggles and you're saying to them

1661
02:03:37.92 --> 02:03:56.24
thank you you made me better and I think that's all I've got for tonight

1662
02:03:59.20 --> 02:04:06.64
so echo let's close it on out how can everyone get on board with the program here

1663
02:04:06.64 --> 02:04:13.68
and support the little podcast we got going enforcement not reinforcements yes

1664
02:04:14.80 --> 02:04:21.68
so indeed few ways first on top of supporting this podcast you're going to want to support

1665
02:04:21.68 --> 02:04:27.12
yourself I think supplementation when I always talk about this I know why not

1666
02:04:28.16 --> 02:04:35.12
anyway on it has the best supplements we all know this krill oil got my krill oil in

1667
02:04:35.12 --> 02:04:43.04
echo's it again actually I'm saying on it every month anyway so on it on it dot com slash

1668
02:04:43.04 --> 02:04:49.12
chocolate 10% off so supplement your wallet as well so the krill oil that's for your joints

1669
02:04:49.12 --> 02:04:55.60
warrior bars as well I think down to get on true tech yeah true tech

1670
02:04:55.60 --> 02:05:05.04
true tech is kind of okay so victor is talking about he's like I'm on true tech today yeah so tell me

1671
02:05:05.04 --> 02:05:11.28
what you think about this so I used to take true tech all the time and be like and I felt

1672
02:05:11.28 --> 02:05:15.68
and I felt like it kind of gave me an advantage because you know how cardio conditioning stuff

1673
02:05:15.68 --> 02:05:19.52
is the tool in jiu-jitsu or can be if you use it do you think that's an advantage

1674
02:05:19.52 --> 02:05:26.08
do I think cardio is an advantage oh so what you think is true tech is like all he took

1675
02:05:26.08 --> 02:05:31.04
true tech doesn't go okay I took true tech and tapped out someone who I don't tap up there's

1676
02:05:31.04 --> 02:05:36.08
two ways to look at that well that's a true tech is really good true tech did not make you tap

1677
02:05:36.08 --> 02:05:41.36
out the first step but indirectly it could have you know okay so I guess I guess the answer

1678
02:05:41.36 --> 02:05:48.08
this would be since you were able with true tech to do more it's pushing you harder so you are

1679
02:05:48.08 --> 02:05:53.76
stepping up your game overall yeah I'm a lot to train because you can train harder because of your

1680
02:05:53.76 --> 02:05:59.36
true tech so it is as far as I'm concerned permissible to do that because you're just trying

1681
02:05:59.36 --> 02:06:04.40
to get yourself better and true tech helps you do that yeah now you might have to you know give a

1682
02:06:04.40 --> 02:06:11.12
caveat put us little asterisk that's your tap out on the true tech so there's it's like a window

1683
02:06:11.12 --> 02:06:15.68
and you say when we got done training I was like you know I didn't take any true tech today

1684
02:06:15.68 --> 02:06:20.24
so maybe you know and you were like either yeah okay it was a level playing field you didn't

1685
02:06:20.24 --> 02:06:26.32
Steven yeah the it's like when you run the 100 meter dash and the wind the strut there's a strong

1686
02:06:26.32 --> 02:06:32.000
wind like you'll you'll get the record but there's a star there as it says wind aided

1687
02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:36.08
oh really says wind aided yeah still your record but it's wind aided sir on those yeah they

1688
02:06:36.08 --> 02:06:41.60
try to be like so yeah when you when you get your true tech and you set your PR in you know in like

1689
02:06:41.60 --> 02:06:47.20
you know a while or something like this you gotta put the star there's like yes no PR but I was on the

1690
02:06:47.20 --> 02:06:53.76
true tech yeah maybe maybe you don't have to do that maybe I don't know but you might anyway

1691
02:06:53.76 --> 02:07:00.32
nonetheless truem tech sport though there's two this truem tech um the other one it's the truem tech

1692
02:07:00.32 --> 02:07:06.80
something else I'm talking about the sport the both of them you yes it's a yeah yeah I'm a

1693
02:07:06.80 --> 02:07:11.92
review had to take them you yeah but no that's for general immunity right that's okay the thing

1694
02:07:13.12 --> 02:07:19.60
that one probably not a p performance enhancing supplement maybe it is okay in directly anyway

1695
02:07:19.60 --> 02:07:25.52
on it uh it's they're from my get 10% off on it dot com slash jockel take the alphabet brain

1696
02:07:25.52 --> 02:07:30.96
to think a little better like it makes you think it's proven by the way that's saying all

1697
02:07:30.96 --> 02:07:36.64
it's legitimately proven not like the 19% the 19% is pretty legitimately proven

1698
02:07:36.64 --> 02:07:43.92
okay so co-miller co-miller you have see fighter Mike best I got an email today got his

1699
02:07:43.92 --> 02:07:50.56

1702
02:08:01.52 --> 02:08:09.44
bang and he said guess what I was wearing he said I'm not gonna attribute it to the rash guard

1703
02:08:09.44 --> 02:08:15.92
specifically but let's let's face it it was the rash guard okay so that being said the we there's

1704
02:08:15.92 --> 02:08:23.60
some's trooper rash guards on jockel store dot com I read it the website by the way the not

1705
02:08:23.60 --> 02:08:29.36
much enough that is just kind of read on nonetheless this rash guards on there they're cool they

1706
02:08:29.36 --> 02:08:36.56
improve your performance 19% tech I guess I mean apparently 19 to 35% really that's the range

1707
02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:43.20
evidently anyway cool rash guards you can check those out jockel store dot com uh there's some shirts there

1708
02:08:43.20 --> 02:08:50.16
too was that you tell me that you saw someone with a shirt on no no Victor Victor was saying oh yeah

1709
02:08:50.16 --> 02:08:54.80
Victor Victor was saying saw someone in the eye and that's the thing when we and I said this before

1710
02:08:54.80 --> 02:09:00.08
of course so you know if you listen you know that I try to put more than just the one layer on the

1711
02:09:00.08 --> 02:09:04.48
shirt it's kind of there's a bunch of inside stuff actually if you talking about the layers on the

1712
02:09:04.48 --> 02:09:09.60
shirts it started to become a thing I'm telling no I'm saying because you know why it's starting to

1713
02:09:09.60 --> 02:09:14.80
become a thing because it is a thing so you're gonna have to like on some future shirt you're

1714
02:09:14.80 --> 02:09:22.64
to actually put the word layers yeah layer one yeah that might be dope either way he was saying how

1715
02:09:22.64 --> 02:09:29.28
he recognized the shirt and when you see someone else wearing like you know they know yeah so

1716
02:09:29.28 --> 02:09:33.28
it's not like you see a quick silver shirt and it's like hey I wear a shirt there's no pants

1717
02:09:33.28 --> 02:09:37.68
you know what I mean it's different it's way different this stuff you you know if you listen you know

1743
02:11:45.56 --> 02:11:47.56
Oh, it's like, it's a weird thing.

1744
02:11:47.56 --> 02:11:50.16
Anyway, something like that.

1745
02:11:50.16 --> 02:11:51.56
You know how like people that celebrate.

Hey, I got to, you know, a thousand subscribers or whatever, you know,

02:11:55.26 --> 02:11:57.76
people that are celebrating, they're posting, you like,

1748
02:11:57.76 --> 02:12:01.76
like, why didn't you celebrate at like a thousand one or

1749
02:12:01.76 --> 02:12:02.76
nine, I think.

1750
02:12:02.76 --> 02:12:03.76
I'll see when I get to a thousand.

1751
02:12:03.76 --> 02:12:04.76
I won't celebrate anything.

1752
02:12:04.76 --> 02:12:06.76
I'll be like, I need to get to 2000.

1753
02:12:06.76 --> 02:12:09.76
And it's not even anything I can stop from my own brain thinking.

1754
02:12:09.76 --> 02:12:10.76
Just thinks that way.

1755
02:12:10.76 --> 02:12:11.76
Yeah.

1756
02:12:11.76 --> 02:12:12.76
So, yeah.

1757
02:12:12.76 --> 02:12:13.76
So your thing is like different.

1758
02:12:13.76 --> 02:12:15.76
Yeah, just like, it's almost like a score.

1759
02:12:15.76 --> 02:12:17.76
Like, oh, well, what's my score right now?

1760
02:12:17.76 --> 02:12:18.76
Right now it's 923.

1761
02:12:18.76 --> 02:12:19.76
Yeah.

1762
02:12:19.76 --> 02:12:20.76
I want my score to be a thousand.

1763
02:12:20.76 --> 02:12:21.76
Why?

1764
02:12:21.76 --> 02:12:22.76
I have no good reason.

1765
02:12:22.76 --> 02:12:23.76
And you.

1766
02:12:23.76 --> 02:12:24.76
Yeah.

1767
02:12:24.76 --> 02:12:25.76
I'm sad.

1768
02:12:25.76 --> 02:12:26.76
Yeah.

1769
02:12:26.76 --> 02:12:27.76
None of the last subscribe.

1770
02:12:27.76 --> 02:12:31.76
Um, that's how you can support and YouTube subscribe to that, you know,

1771
02:12:31.76 --> 02:12:34.76
if you're down, if you're into YouTube watching videos,

1772
02:12:34.76 --> 02:12:35.76
I'm subscribed to that.

1773
02:12:35.76 --> 02:12:37.76
I think I'm going to put out another one here.

1774
02:12:37.76 --> 02:12:38.76
Pretty soon.

1775
02:12:38.76 --> 02:12:39.76
Yeah.

1776
02:12:39.76 --> 02:12:40.76
We are going to put out another one.

1777
02:12:40.76 --> 02:12:41.76
We hear that a lot.

1778
02:12:41.76 --> 02:12:42.76
I know.

1779
02:12:42.76 --> 02:12:44.76
You know, hey, it kind of like the email list, you know,

1780
02:12:44.76 --> 02:12:46.76
like, oh, okay, I'll talk about it in a second,

1781
02:12:46.76 --> 02:12:50.76
but you know, like the email list, we sign up that the insider's list and

1782
02:12:50.76 --> 02:12:51.76
sign up.

1783
02:12:51.76 --> 02:12:54.76
And be like, hey, I'll send you, you know, some, we'll send you some stuff.

1784
02:12:54.76 --> 02:12:57.76
I'm not going to send you stuff every day.

1785
02:12:57.76 --> 02:12:58.76
I'm just kind of like the YouTube.

1786
02:12:58.76 --> 02:12:59.76
I'm going to put more videos.

1787
02:12:59.76 --> 02:13:03.76
Maybe not every week, but you know, there will be more things to get.

1788
02:13:03.76 --> 02:13:05.76
Basically, I'm not there.

1789
02:13:05.76 --> 02:13:07.76
Any email on my end.

1790
02:13:07.76 --> 02:13:10.76
People are like, hey, Jocco keep making a podcast every week.

1791
02:13:10.76 --> 02:13:11.76
I say, it'll go great.

1792
02:13:11.76 --> 02:13:12.76
I do.

1793
02:13:12.76 --> 02:13:15.76
You're at, you, they tell you, hey, echo can you make some more videos and you're like,

1794
02:13:15.76 --> 02:13:16.76
you know what?

1795
02:13:16.76 --> 02:13:18.76
They can, they can wait.

1796
02:13:18.76 --> 02:13:19.76
No, no.

1797
02:13:19.76 --> 02:13:21.76
That's what that's the artist in you.

1798
02:13:21.76 --> 02:13:23.76
No, no, that's not the artist right there.

1799
02:13:23.76 --> 02:13:27.76
Um, um, yeah, we'll do some more videos.

1800
02:13:27.76 --> 02:13:28.76
I'll have a, with that.

1801
02:13:28.76 --> 02:13:31.76
We're all sitting here holding our breath.

1802
02:13:31.76 --> 02:13:33.76
There, echo Charles for you to make more videos.

1803
02:13:33.76 --> 02:13:34.76
See what you're doing.

1804
02:13:34.76 --> 02:13:35.76
You're just like, stroke my ego.

1805
02:13:35.76 --> 02:13:37.76
Like, we're waiting for your next video.

1806
02:13:37.76 --> 02:13:38.76
Whatever.

1807
02:13:38.76 --> 02:13:39.76
And I'm like, you guys, they're waiting for me.

1808
02:13:39.76 --> 02:13:40.76
I'm gonna put on the video.

1809
02:13:40.76 --> 02:13:42.76
Be like, yeah, so I want to, my video guys.

1810
02:13:42.76 --> 02:13:43.76
I'm like, no, I'm gonna make it.

1811
02:13:43.76 --> 02:13:45.76
Why do you have every, every minute video that you got done,

1812
02:13:45.76 --> 02:13:48.76
and you said, I'm not even going to release this thing because it's too bad.

1813
02:13:48.76 --> 02:13:49.76
Yes.

1814
02:13:49.76 --> 02:13:50.76
I'm a whole series.

1815
02:13:50.76 --> 02:13:51.76
Oh, yeah.

1816
02:13:51.76 --> 02:13:55.76
Bro, I'm telling you, because when you do this, bro, it's, yeah,

1817
02:13:55.76 --> 02:13:57.76
there's like, one of them's called, um,

1818
02:13:57.76 --> 02:13:59.76
for people you find on Facebook and like,

1819
02:13:59.76 --> 02:14:00.76
Conan's in it.

1820
02:14:00.76 --> 02:14:01.76
It's like the people who take pit.

1821
02:14:01.76 --> 02:14:04.76
One of them is like, the people who take pictures of, um,

1822
02:14:04.76 --> 02:14:07.76
themselves, but they want to act like they're taking a picture of something.

1823
02:14:07.76 --> 02:14:10.76
You know, but it's like, um, it's like this thing,

1824
02:14:10.76 --> 02:14:12.76
and it just didn't come out good.

1825
02:14:12.76 --> 02:14:13.76
Anyway, nonetheless.

1826
02:14:13.76 --> 02:14:16.76
Yeah, I am very weary of these things.

1827
02:14:16.76 --> 02:14:18.76
Anyway, so yeah, support that way.

1828
02:14:18.76 --> 02:14:19.76
Back to the store, jockel store.

1829
02:14:19.76 --> 02:14:21.76
Is it a new stuff?

1830
02:14:21.76 --> 02:14:24.76
Is it annoying to sit here and talk about like this stuff right here?

1831
02:14:24.76 --> 02:14:28.76
Um, no, I don't think so.

1832
02:14:28.76 --> 02:14:32.76
I mean, if, if I didn't have Debbie and everyone's saying,

1833
02:14:32.76 --> 02:14:34.76
whoo, echo where's the girl stuff?

1834
02:14:34.76 --> 02:14:37.76
You know, and they're just like, all right, you know,

1835
02:14:37.76 --> 02:14:38.76
like, not saying anything.

1836
02:14:38.76 --> 02:14:39.76
This is the thing.

1837
02:14:39.76 --> 02:14:40.76
So just so I think about it.

1838
02:14:40.76 --> 02:14:42.76
Like, I always think like, okay, we can probably cut this,

1839
02:14:42.76 --> 02:14:44.76
you know, hey, let's just run through, you know,

1840
02:14:44.76 --> 02:14:46.76
how to support the podcast, you should take three minutes.

1841
02:14:46.76 --> 02:14:48.76
For some reason, it turns into a 15 minute conversation.

1842
02:14:48.76 --> 02:14:49.76
Yeah.

1843
02:14:49.76 --> 02:14:52.76
And I don't, I don't, it's, I never intend to do that.

1844
02:14:52.76 --> 02:14:54.76
And then when I listen to it, I actually laugh at most of it.

1845
02:14:54.76 --> 02:14:56.76
And I think it's pretty funny.

1846
02:14:56.76 --> 02:14:57.76
So I don't know.

1847
02:14:57.76 --> 02:15:01.76
Well, we should do like, go to our podcast of us just talking about

1848
02:15:01.76 --> 02:15:02.76
how to support the podcast.

1849
02:15:02.76 --> 02:15:03.76
Because it might be pretty funny.

1850
02:15:03.76 --> 02:15:04.76
Because you're laughing right now.

1851
02:15:04.76 --> 02:15:06.76
I was laughing a second ago.

1852
02:15:06.76 --> 02:15:08.76
And maybe that'd be the greatest topic ever.

1853
02:15:08.76 --> 02:15:09.76
Okay.

1854
02:15:09.76 --> 02:15:12.76
So in that regard, I'm not saying this is proof, but this is evidence.

1855
02:15:12.76 --> 02:15:14.76
And this happened more than once by the way.

1856
02:15:14.76 --> 02:15:17.76
So, you know, that will order a show.

1857
02:15:17.76 --> 02:15:18.76
And it's online.

1858
02:15:18.76 --> 02:15:19.76
So you can't try on the shirts.

1859
02:15:19.76 --> 02:15:22.76
So people will be like, hey, and what's the shirt size is it?

1860
02:15:22.76 --> 02:15:23.76
Whatever.

1861
02:15:23.76 --> 02:15:26.76
And they'll say, hey, I need a bigger size.

1862
02:15:26.76 --> 02:15:29.76
Or, I don't know, I forgot to change my address.

1863
02:15:29.76 --> 02:15:32.76
Or something where, you know, they require another shirt.

1864
02:15:32.76 --> 02:15:33.76
Yep.

1865
02:15:33.76 --> 02:15:36.76
So there it be times that be like, oh, I'll just send it to you.

1866
02:15:36.76 --> 02:15:38.76
Like, it got lost in the mail, whatever.

1867
02:15:38.76 --> 02:15:39.76
I'll just send it.

1868
02:15:39.76 --> 02:15:40.76
So I just send it.

1869
02:15:40.76 --> 02:15:42.76
And they're like, no, no, I, I, I didn't, oh, no, no, here.

1870
02:15:42.76 --> 02:15:43.76
This is what it was.

1871
02:15:43.76 --> 02:15:47.76
And that happened before, but here's the, here's a very specific one I'm thinking about.

1872
02:15:47.76 --> 02:15:50.76
Where I sent apparently two shirts.

1873
02:15:50.76 --> 02:15:51.76
They got two shirts.

1874
02:15:51.76 --> 02:15:52.76
They were supposed to get one.

1875
02:15:52.76 --> 02:15:53.76
This supposed to get one.

1876
02:15:53.76 --> 02:15:54.76
Yeah.

1877
02:15:54.76 --> 02:15:55.76
And they were like, I got two shirts.

1878
02:15:55.76 --> 02:15:57.76
I'm keeping them.

1879
02:15:57.76 --> 02:15:58.76
Tell me where to pay.

1880
02:15:58.76 --> 02:16:00.76
Tell me, like, tell me how I can pay.

1881
02:16:00.76 --> 02:16:02.76
Because you can't go and click another, you know, it'll go in the ors.

1882
02:16:02.76 --> 02:16:03.76
It's somewhere I can pay.

1883
02:16:03.76 --> 02:16:04.76
I was like, ah, keep the shirt.

1884
02:16:04.76 --> 02:16:05.76
That's all you.

1885
02:16:05.76 --> 02:16:06.76
You know, give it to somebody.

1886
02:16:06.76 --> 02:16:08.76
And they're like, I demand to pay.

1887
02:16:08.76 --> 02:16:12.76
Like, part of the reason is to support this podcast, you know?

1888
02:16:12.76 --> 02:16:13.76
Yeah.

1889
02:16:13.76 --> 02:16:18.76
So, and I'm kind of like, dang.

1890
02:16:18.76 --> 02:16:24.76
There are enforcements out there who embrace their reinforcing.

1891
02:16:24.76 --> 02:16:27.76
That's why that's why I think this is relevant.

1892
02:16:27.76 --> 02:16:32.76
Well, yeah, well, I guess my point is, is that when we're talking about this stuff,

1893
02:16:32.76 --> 02:16:37.76
what should be a 30 second thing turns into a 15 minute thing.

1894
02:16:37.76 --> 02:16:39.76
Like it's happening right now.

1895
02:16:39.76 --> 02:16:44.76
And when I listen to the podcast and I'll start going, oh, here come the advertisements.

1896
02:16:44.76 --> 02:16:47.76
I got to make a note to say, shorten these down.

1897
02:16:47.76 --> 02:16:49.76
And then I say, oh, you know what?

1898
02:16:49.76 --> 02:16:51.76
That was actually funny as hell.

1899
02:16:51.76 --> 02:16:53.76
So, I don't know.

1900
02:16:53.76 --> 02:16:55.76
Maybe I'm just ultra sensitive.

1901
02:16:55.76 --> 02:16:58.76
Yeah, maybe just like the ritual thing.

1902
02:16:58.76 --> 02:16:59.76
Maybe Doug in.

1903
02:16:59.76 --> 02:17:01.76
So what were you saying the store?

1904
02:17:01.76 --> 02:17:02.76
Yeah, the store.

1905
02:17:02.76 --> 02:17:04.76
So, hey, there's this new stuff.

1906
02:17:04.76 --> 02:17:09.76
It's the first time where I'm saying it publicly, but there's hoodies and they're pretty cool.

1907
02:17:09.76 --> 02:17:11.76
Apparently that's what people are saying.

1908
02:17:11.76 --> 02:17:13.76
You know, Jocos said, so good.

1909
02:17:13.76 --> 02:17:14.76
I like them.

1910
02:17:14.76 --> 02:17:19.76
Also, I read the patches where they're, you know, how JPE last week said,

1911
02:17:19.76 --> 02:17:21.76
Federal dark earth.

1912
02:17:21.76 --> 02:17:23.76
Apparently it's flat, darker.

1913
02:17:23.76 --> 02:17:24.76
Okay.

1914
02:17:24.76 --> 02:17:27.76
Not to be confused with flatter.

1915
02:17:27.76 --> 02:17:28.76
Okay.

1916
02:17:28.76 --> 02:17:29.76
People think they're at this point.

1917
02:17:29.76 --> 02:17:33.76
Yeah, we don't want Eddie Bravo to get fired up about the other people.

1918
02:17:33.76 --> 02:17:34.76
Does he think that?

1919
02:17:34.76 --> 02:17:35.76
No.

1920
02:17:35.76 --> 02:17:37.76
Is that kind of his conspiracy things that he believes in?

1921
02:17:37.76 --> 02:17:38.76
I don't think so now.

1922
02:17:38.76 --> 02:17:40.76
He believes in all kinds of crazy conspiracies.

1923
02:17:40.76 --> 02:17:41.76
Yeah, I don't know.

1924
02:17:41.76 --> 02:17:42.76
I don't know.

1925
02:17:42.76 --> 02:17:43.76
I'm not going to argue.

1926
02:17:43.76 --> 02:17:44.76
Yeah, I'm not going to argue.

1927
02:17:44.76 --> 02:17:45.76
He knows.

1928
02:17:45.76 --> 02:17:46.76
I don't want to.

1929
02:17:46.76 --> 02:17:47.76
I'll talk to Robert Garder about it.

1930
02:17:47.76 --> 02:17:50.76
I don't want to talk about nothing else, man.

1931
02:17:50.76 --> 02:17:51.76
No.

1932
02:17:51.76 --> 02:17:52.76
That's too.

1933
02:17:52.76 --> 02:17:54.76
He's got too many facts and figures about stuff.

1934
02:17:54.76 --> 02:17:59.76
You know, facts and figures about all kinds of conspiracy stuff that I don't want

1935
02:17:59.76 --> 02:18:00.76
to argue with.

1936
02:18:00.76 --> 02:18:01.76
Yeah.

1937
02:18:01.76 --> 02:18:03.76
I'm going to argue with him being not worth.

1938
02:18:03.76 --> 02:18:04.76
I don't want to enter that world.

1939
02:18:04.76 --> 02:18:05.76
I'm staying out of that world.

1940
02:18:05.76 --> 02:18:06.76
You know why?

1941
02:18:06.76 --> 02:18:09.76
Because I guess I'm too blind to see the reality.

1942
02:18:09.76 --> 02:18:09.76
Yeah.

1943
02:18:09.76 --> 02:18:10.76
You're not worth it.

1944
02:18:10.76 --> 02:18:11.76
It's okay.

1945
02:18:11.76 --> 02:18:12.76
Almost stay blind.

1946
02:18:12.76 --> 02:18:13.76
Okay.

1947
02:18:13.76 --> 02:18:14.76
You're all good.

1948
02:18:14.76 --> 02:18:16.76
But the flat dark.

1949
02:18:16.76 --> 02:18:17.76
There's a color.

1950
02:18:17.76 --> 02:18:19.76
So we got it's the fish of one where if you know you're new.

1951
02:18:19.76 --> 02:18:20.76
There's three.

1952
02:18:20.76 --> 02:18:21.76
Is it two by three?

1953
02:18:21.76 --> 02:18:22.76
Two by three.

1954
02:18:22.76 --> 02:18:22.76
Okay.

1955
02:18:22.76 --> 02:18:23.76
Anyway.

1956
02:18:23.76 --> 02:18:24.76
So let's come this far.

1957
02:18:24.76 --> 02:18:25.76
It's new stuff on jockelstore.com.

1958
02:18:25.76 --> 02:18:26.76
Nice.

1959
02:18:26.76 --> 02:18:27.76
So yeah, look at that.

1960
02:18:27.76 --> 02:18:29.76
Jockels are to come look at the stuff on there.

1961
02:18:29.76 --> 02:18:31.76
If you like it, go grab one.

1962
02:18:31.76 --> 02:18:34.76
You can enforce reinforced and support this podcast.

1963
02:18:34.76 --> 02:18:35.76
That way.

1964
02:18:35.76 --> 02:18:36.76
Which is awesome.

1965
02:18:36.76 --> 02:18:37.76
Appreciate it.

1966
02:18:37.76 --> 02:18:39.76
You can also get some jockel.

1967
02:18:39.76 --> 02:18:41.76
Which I've been drinking liberally all night long.

1968
02:18:41.76 --> 02:18:43.76
And I'm feeling pretty good right now.

1969
02:18:43.76 --> 02:18:44.76
How do you have some?

1970
02:18:44.76 --> 02:18:45.76
Because we're out.

1971
02:18:45.76 --> 02:18:46.76
Yeah.

1972
02:18:46.76 --> 02:18:48.76
Well, so I got massive quantities.

1973
02:18:48.76 --> 02:18:50.76
I actually told our supplier.

1974
02:18:50.76 --> 02:18:52.76
I will never.

1975
02:18:52.76 --> 02:18:54.76
We will never run out of this again.

1976
02:18:54.76 --> 02:18:55.76
How do we make that happen?

1977
02:18:55.76 --> 02:18:57.76
And they told me how to make it happen?

1978
02:18:57.76 --> 02:19:00.76
So it's going to be back in Amazon directly.

1979
02:19:00.76 --> 02:19:03.76
And we will never run out of it again.

1980
02:19:03.76 --> 02:19:04.76
That's my whole day.

1981
02:19:04.76 --> 02:19:06.76
I learned a lot of it.

1982
02:19:06.76 --> 02:19:07.76
I learned a lot of it.

1983
02:19:07.76 --> 02:19:09.76
Because I didn't know that people were going to be selling to it.

1984
02:19:09.76 --> 02:19:11.76
And then I realized.

1985
02:19:11.76 --> 02:19:12.76
Because you know, sometimes you're in a bubble.

1986
02:19:12.76 --> 02:19:13.76
Yes.

1987
02:19:13.76 --> 02:19:15.76
And you think something's really cool.

1988
02:19:15.76 --> 02:19:16.76
Yep.

1989
02:19:16.76 --> 02:19:17.76
And no one else does.

1990
02:19:17.76 --> 02:19:21.76
I have been in that bubble many times in my life where I thought something was really cool.

1991
02:19:21.76 --> 02:19:24.76
And then I get outside the bubble and people don't think it's cool.

1992
02:19:24.76 --> 02:19:25.76
Bro, my whole life.

1993
02:19:25.76 --> 02:19:33.76
So I was under suspicion that this situation, where I like this tea, this random tea.

1994
02:19:33.76 --> 02:19:36.76
And then I got it tweet to my specific liking.

1995
02:19:36.76 --> 02:19:39.76
And I thought, well, okay, not only have I taken a random thing.

1996
02:19:39.76 --> 02:19:42.76
And then I've tweeted to be specifically what I like.

1997
02:19:42.76 --> 02:19:47.76
I'm thinking of myself like, what seven people in the world are going to dig this?

1998
02:19:47.76 --> 02:19:50.76
Well, what I should have done was taking it and giving it to a bunch of people and said,

1999
02:19:50.76 --> 02:19:52.76
Hey, is this what do you think of this?

2000
02:19:52.76 --> 02:19:55.76
Because by the time we did that, we basically did that.

2001
02:19:55.76 --> 02:19:58.76
And you realize that it tastes really, really good.

2002
02:19:58.76 --> 02:20:02.76
It's a unique flavorful taste.

2003
02:20:02.76 --> 02:20:05.76
And I think that's like part one is that it tastes really good.

2004
02:20:05.76 --> 02:20:07.76
It doesn't taste like anything else.

2005
02:20:07.76 --> 02:20:09.76
It's just got a very, it doesn't taste like a juice.

2006
02:20:09.76 --> 02:20:11.76
It doesn't taste like a tea.

2007
02:20:11.76 --> 02:20:12.76
What does it taste like?

2008
02:20:12.76 --> 02:20:14.76
It just tastes like it.

2009
02:20:14.76 --> 02:20:15.76
It tastes like what it tastes like.

2010
02:20:15.76 --> 02:20:16.76
And it tastes good.

2011
02:20:16.76 --> 02:20:20.76
And universally, universally, people go, oh, yeah, that's that tastes great.

2012
02:20:20.76 --> 02:20:24.76
It's just a universally good tasting thing.

2013
02:20:24.76 --> 02:20:28.76
And then on top of that, you get the micro dose of caffeine.

2014
02:20:28.76 --> 02:20:29.76
Just the micro dose.

2015
02:20:29.76 --> 02:20:33.76
So it's this thing that just comes in subsurface and just gives it to you.

2016
02:20:33.76 --> 02:20:36.76
But it doesn't override your normal senses.

2017
02:20:36.76 --> 02:20:40.76
And then on top of that, you got the antioxidant thing, which for all I know,

2018
02:20:40.76 --> 02:20:45.76
it's just just repairing and taking care of your body, right?

2019
02:20:45.76 --> 02:20:48.76
So you combine all those things together.

2020
02:20:48.76 --> 02:20:51.76
And we got something very popular on our hands.

2021
02:20:51.76 --> 02:20:54.76
And again, I thought that inside my bubble, I thought it was something inside my bubble.

2022
02:20:54.76 --> 02:20:55.76
It was going to be popular.

2023
02:20:55.76 --> 02:20:58.76
But now I realize that it's a very, everybody loves the way it tastes.

2024
02:20:58.76 --> 02:21:00.76
And everybody loves the way it makes you feel.

2025
02:21:00.76 --> 02:21:05.76
So what I got to do is order through the manufacturer, order the ton of it,

2026
02:21:05.76 --> 02:21:07.76
and go online.

2027
02:21:07.76 --> 02:21:09.76
Yeah, make it enter it.

2028
02:21:09.76 --> 02:21:12.76
And you know, some people also said, hey, you know what?

2029
02:21:12.76 --> 02:21:19.76
I got to do it.

2030
02:21:19.76 --> 02:21:22.76
And it cost a lot because we got a high quality container to put it in.

2031
02:21:22.76 --> 02:21:26.76
The tin, as it's known, luxurious, the luxury, the luxury.

2032
02:21:26.76 --> 02:21:27.76
You know what it was?

2033
02:21:27.76 --> 02:21:28.76
It's Deluxe.

2034
02:21:28.76 --> 02:21:30.76
It didn't say luxurious.

2035
02:21:30.76 --> 02:21:32.76
I didn't forget to rewind that part.

2036
02:21:32.76 --> 02:21:35.76
But the tin cost a lot of money to make.

2037
02:21:35.76 --> 02:21:37.76
And so that's what it is.

2038
02:21:37.76 --> 02:21:40.76
Well, when people said it was too expensive, I said, oh, okay, cool.

2039
02:21:40.76 --> 02:21:43.76
I'm going to put it in a box also. So we got to come in a box.

2040
02:21:43.76 --> 02:21:47.76
You can still get it in the tin because you need at least one tin.

2041
02:21:47.76 --> 02:21:48.76
Oh, you got to have a purpose tactical.

2042
02:21:48.76 --> 02:21:49.76
Multiple purpose tactics.

2043
02:21:49.76 --> 02:21:51.76
And you probably need a few of them in your house.

2044
02:21:51.76 --> 02:21:55.76
Pens, check, screws and nails, check.

2045
02:21:55.76 --> 02:21:58.76
You anti itself, check.

2046
02:21:58.76 --> 02:22:03.76
And then you're also also going to be able to buy it in big box with a hundred count in there.

2047
02:22:03.76 --> 02:22:05.76
So we're taking care of you on that end.

2048
02:22:05.76 --> 02:22:06.76
Yeah.

2049
02:22:06.76 --> 02:22:11.76
Again, here I was. All I was wrote down to say was we have Jocca White Tea.

2050
02:22:11.76 --> 02:22:11.76
Right?

2051
02:22:11.76 --> 02:22:13.76
Unset I talk about it for eight minutes.

2052
02:22:13.76 --> 02:22:14.76
What is wrong with me?

2053
02:22:14.76 --> 02:22:15.76
You got to.

2054
02:22:15.76 --> 02:22:17.76
Well, you know what? I think it's too much Jocca White Tea.

2055
02:22:17.76 --> 02:22:18.76
Has got me talking.

2056
02:22:18.76 --> 02:22:22.76
You got me mentally engaged at such a level that I didn't even just take it easy.

2057
02:22:22.76 --> 02:22:24.76
The ones that have feed that.

2058
02:22:24.76 --> 02:22:27.76
Also, we got a book, Extreme Ownership.

2059
02:22:27.76 --> 02:22:30.76
It's about combat leadership.

2060
02:22:30.76 --> 02:22:33.76
Therefore, it's about all leadership.

2061
02:22:33.76 --> 02:22:36.76
Written by myself and my brother, Dave Babin.

2062
02:22:36.76 --> 02:22:41.76
And if you buy the audio version, it's read by myself and my brother, Dave Babin.

2063
02:22:41.76 --> 02:22:42.76
So you can check that out.

2064
02:22:42.76 --> 02:22:44.76
It's also what I am, was on.

2065
02:22:44.76 --> 02:22:45.76
Appreciate it.

2066
02:22:45.76 --> 02:22:49.76
Following that.

2067
02:22:49.76 --> 02:22:54.76
If you happen to want to continue this conversation that we're having right now,

2068
02:22:54.76 --> 02:22:57.76
or you just want to get after it on the interwebs.

2069
02:22:57.76 --> 02:22:58.76
That's cool.

2070
02:22:58.76 --> 02:22:59.76
You can do it.

2071
02:22:59.76 --> 02:23:00.76
We are there.

2072
02:23:00.76 --> 02:23:02.76
We're on Twitter.

2073
02:23:02.76 --> 02:23:04.76
We're on Instagram.

2074
02:23:04.76 --> 02:23:09.76
And you know that we's at that fast bookie.

2075
02:23:09.76 --> 02:23:11.76
Echo.

2076
02:23:11.76 --> 02:23:19.76
Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocco Willing.

2077
02:23:19.76 --> 02:23:28.76
And thanks to everybody for listening for joining us as we join you.

2078
02:23:28.76 --> 02:23:31.76
Trying to figure out how to get better.

2079
02:23:31.76 --> 02:23:40.76
And to my brothers in arms in the military overseas hunting down evil and destroying it.

2080
02:23:40.76 --> 02:23:45.76
You all out there stay aggressive and stay ahead of the enemy.

2081
02:23:45.76 --> 02:23:49.76
And the police and law enforcement.

2082
02:23:49.76 --> 02:23:54.76
Thanks for holding the line and fighting crime and the firefighters.

2083
02:23:54.76 --> 02:24:00.76
Of course, thanks for your vigilance and your courage.

2084
02:24:00.76 --> 02:24:05.76
Under actual fire.

2085
02:24:05.76 --> 02:24:09.76
And the rest of you troopers out there listening.

2086
02:24:09.76 --> 02:24:12.76
Honing your skills.

2087
02:24:12.76 --> 02:24:14.76
Building buildings.

2088
02:24:14.76 --> 02:24:16.76
Creating creations.

2089
02:24:16.76 --> 02:24:18.76
Designing designs.

2090
02:24:18.76 --> 02:24:21.76
Developing developments.

2091
02:24:21.76 --> 02:24:23.76
Working on.

2092
02:24:23.76 --> 02:24:26.76
What you are working on.

2093
02:24:26.76 --> 02:24:37.76
Thanks for your relentless pursuit of excellence and of growth and of progress.

2094
02:24:37.76 --> 02:24:39.76
And most of all.

2095
02:24:39.76 --> 02:24:45.76
Thank you for getting after it.

2096
02:24:45.76 --> 02:24:47.76
So until next time.

2097
02:24:47.76 --> 02:24:50.76
This is Echo and Jocco.

2098
02:24:50.76 --> 02:24:52.76
Out.

2099
02:24:52.76 --> 02:24:57.76
Thank you.
