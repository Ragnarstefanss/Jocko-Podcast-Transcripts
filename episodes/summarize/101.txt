and I'd be hungry a lot but at the same time the diet would be really effective with a good workout program and then so when I go off the program you kind of you know you feel kind of almost like for lack of better term like toxic like or just a sack of you know you almost I kind of miss that hunger and the you know the because you kind of associate the hunger that you always have with like being in good shape and and like a proper point it kind of like that's an example of like how it can be you know you know like I think like but it's like man you can figure a lot of things out that you a lot of people wouldn't figure out you know like I know Viva was like that for sure but like that's like a good shot how that you know no one's no care that's just a beach or whatever or they break up with you whatever you know something that makes you in a bad mood for whatever it's in they should go to the gym and do like shoulders or chest workouts something that would give like a really really hard painful pump you know that kind like I don't know 12 15 reps like a minute in between like eight sets of those massively pumped for some reason I just feel way better that's the same thing that's what I'm talking about but you do that enough and you get used to it and to the point where you kind of like require it in a way like you kind of want to like you know how are you still going like you know like a strict diet just so it's gotten to the point over literally like what like almost a decade of training with you and that thing getting sunk in that efficiently on my own name you're not that far from the truth it's like my body like knows like hey we've been here before this one my brain is almost like I can feel my brain as a separate entity tell my body sometimes if I get you in a guillotine so like you like that you're getting it is friends you know when you you fall off the path you say and when you feel like crap because you're off the program and the fact that you're off the program aside from just your physical physicality you feel like crap so you got to alleviate that feeling so you go to something that's gonna give you pleasure but forget what wrong pleasure you and short term when you need it long term you know and you I mean to give you a breakdown of your guillotine your guillotine cobra which I think is even more so than the guillotine like you have such a good way to like get it you're one of those guys that like you're probably walking like right now you're thinking about guillotine right now that's what I think that's what it feels a lot and then I'd win another one you know you gotta win like matches till the final after two matches I just start feeling this pressure like it's almost like one way my two match win streak is about to come to an end it's a little like the pressure and then you win one more and then the pressure is even on more is weird And if people are like this in general, that is just like I said, that's kind of like a, not a late missed test, but kind of like, it's this indicator, you know, he didn't remember me. You know, so like my brother, for example, like if I know him, but then when I hear him talking to like, I don't know exactly. like what would it freak out more if someone said oh you got this or if someone says hey at least you made it this far would you then back off but because when you're dealing with kids it would you know like I mean like I got kids you got kids too you know like I'll be like hey listen to this song it's the best song and then like you don't like it You know, like in, you know, like we're probably both in like the comfort zone big time as far as certain things. Well, that's, you know, the thing ultimately, like, you know, like, and I mentioned, Mr. Mia, like, uncrout credit kit, right? yeah that's good stuff to say to me but anything to put pressure on me like if you do this you win like you know like one more match Well no if you're you're not helping the cause if you're seeking death right you don't want to die that's not our goal it's an occurrence that could happen and matter fact that's gonna happen all of us but the way I look at it is what we're trying to learn we're trying to understand and master his death and the fear of death if we can get over that little little hurdle right then you've mastered that and once you're actually saying I'm going forward don't prepare it then we're good or could be also just like just you know as far as seeking challenges go you want to seek one challenge and you want to seek a bigger challenge and the air it would be weird because he pulled out that climbing thing he'd be like a bad I could climb up there you know that it's kind like dang if you kind of have these like looking at things through frames that are that are useful You know, and he's like, oh, this is so dumb then at the end, he gets the picture, you know, but as he's doing it, I mean, he didn't say, you know, if you can't send the floor, how are you going to, why then the term, and nothing like that? I think so too I don't like the fact that it's like that I don't like I think I think talking about it might help or it might straight up not yeah rash guards geese made in America which is awesome so that's But that whole thing where, how do you expect to do this when you can't even, you know, tire shoes right or whatever, you know, like, like, say, or you don't bind to that, I don't know. but I felt like maybe if you got 19 I felt like that day I had like 20% you're bringing it like and you want to get them for your team or business we have a leadership and management consulting company it's the premier leadership and management consulting company did I say that yes I did echelon front me life jpe Dave Burke if you want us to come and work with your company and get your leadership aligned and get your leadership into destroyer mode email info echelon front dot com and if you have any more questions or answers for us or something that you want to tell us you can find us up on the interwebs on Twitter on Instagram and on the face she ball echelon is at echelon Charles and I am at jacco winlink and to the soldiers sailors airman and marine tour overseas right now defending our nation and our freedom thank you for your sacrifice and to the families of those men and women thanks for supporting your warriors while they are deployed that is one of the hardest jobs in the world and thank you for doing it and to the police law enforcement firefighters paramedics and other first responders thank you for protecting us here at home you do not get thanked enough I'm thanking you right now and for the rest of you out there maneuvering through life trying to get the upper hand on the enemy or the competitor or trying to get the upper hand and get control of yourself you know what to do you know what action to take you know how to win so get out there and get after it and so until next time this is echo and jacco out Yeah, it's the idea just like I said, like, we all want to like stay cozy and are been and kind of take our time. But it was like, it's like a lot of stuff is like, because you, um, you know, when you get a lot of people coming in trying to challenge you at the academy. and then you're like pushing it on other people some people do it with um bro goddingly Pikachu sure just various things you know books music why do we do that with music like if you you don't like my I don't have a new shirt you have a new shirt coming out do I know what it is nope interesting not yet a lot of times I'll get input from the online people from the people and I kind of you know every most of the time it's like one off things you know ooh dude it has echo's name in it why is echo's name in it echo's name is isn't it because we took Q&A from the podcast about leadership and put the really important questions and answers in there so you can refer back to them without having to go through 101 podcasts and find the one question that you want to get now now you can find it in the book also it's got a new cover on it which is black more cool and you know because the Q&A is from you I kind of need to thank everyone because this book is not just life and me anymore now it's life and be an echo and everyone that asks questions and help with the podcast by asking questions so thanks to you all for the new version of our new book also the discipline equals freedom field manual is now available worldwide and if you've got questions this book has answers if you're wondering what work out should I do what Marshall Aren't should I train in how do I know what a good GGG to gym is what should I eat what should I do Usually when I'd run like four miles or five miles on the treadmill, it'd be like ten, like just under like nine minutes. I'm just, I'm just saying like, if let's say we're all at a like a part of barbecue with like just a vast variety, but like that's totally acceptable. I think that that's that's something that we actually talk about all the time in fact that may be the very purpose of me doing everything that we do which is you know studying and learning and to go back to the question that that Eric the translator posed to me can any of the rules in this book apply to modern warfare as I said not only do they apply to modern warfare they apply to life and the thing is there's nothing really new here right just like an arm lock there's nothing really new here but that doesn't mean that there's nothing really new here there's always something new we sure we've heard these lessons before right we've heard them from dick winners we've heard them from Bob Hoffman we've heard them from general patent and hack worth but that's pretty, like, that's an obvious translation, you know, like, like, I'm gonna foot lock something. and I'm injured what should I do if I don't feel like working out what should I do something bad happens how should I overcome failure if you got those kind of questions this book has the answers discipline equals freedom field manual get it for yourself and get it for anyone else that might want answers to these questions the book is not normal it's not normal I know it's not normal because you know why I'm not normal no the book is it's black and yeah this is his note it says the line about throwing your bond into the river relying on fate to determine if you float in the shallow is very famous it's not that famous because I Google it back couldn't find it now he says enter battle fleek completely committed and perhaps you will emerge alive at the end I think that makes some sense for me prepare the best of your ability yeah be fully committed and then don't worry about what the end's gonna come because you can't control everything I think we're good I think okay now this one I had to I had to dig on this one a little bit too samurai study a great many things however the single focus of their learning is death and then the the the amplifying information here is while samurai do intensive training and study a variety of topics what it all boils down to is seeking death so that that kind of that one I will I tried to figure out what that meant or at least what it means to me if you're shooting regularly you get that you get past that and then older you get the more you do it the more you can just say you don't don't care you know what a phrase would would always work with me when someone like you've got a coach or something where you know in football you'd have this where you're like you'd be winning the whole game mm-hmm it's almost like they're gonna say punch it through or something you know something like that that indicates don't let up at the end mentally you know just go just keep pushing the way
