00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.50
This is Jockel podcast number 332 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, I go.

2
00:00:06.50 --> 00:00:19.50
So when I first started this podcast, when we first started this podcast, I was talking about different situations.

3
00:00:19.50 --> 00:00:26.000
How I handled different situations, what I thought about various subjects, different viewpoints.

4
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I had concerning leadership and really concerning human nature.

5
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And almost immediately, you started getting feedback and started getting asked questions and people would say,

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
hey, have you studied stoicism or are you, did you do a lot of work?

7
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You know, looking at at Nietzsche or some other ancient or modern school of philosophy?

8
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And the short answer was that no, I didn't do that.

9
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I mean, I left high school during the military. So there wasn't this big educational background for me.

10
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'm not an academic of any kind. In fact, there was a funny, one of the earliest live events that I did.

11
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And it was a relatively cultured audience out there.

12
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And someone asked, you know, hey, who's your favorite, who's your favorite philosopher?

13
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And I said, let me. And no one laughed, like I laughed, but no one else laughed.

14
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And so I added, I said, you know, let me from from motorhead and a couple of people sort of awkwardly laughed, but not much.

15
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And later on, we explored this idea a little bit more in the podcast.

16
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And because look, there's much to be learned from old philosophers and old thinkers.

17
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And as it turns out, I agree with animal line with a lot of what they say, no doubt about it.

18
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I'm not trying to say anything negative about these ancient philosophers and the theories that they had.

19
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
But the fact of the matter is I just didn't study them.

20
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I mean, like I said, I was a shitty high school student.

21
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I didn't, I don't think I read any books in high school.

22
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So yeah, I didn't learn anything about these things.

23
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I just figured these things out through my own random trials and tribulations in life.

24
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And it was a similar situation with Jordan Peterson when he came on the podcast for the first time.

25
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It was really obvious that we had come to many of the same conclusions in our views of life.

26
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
But he got to those conclusions through a rigorous academic study.

27
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And work as a clinical psychologist.

28
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And I got there through my experiences in life and in the teams.

29
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And I've been very lucky in that regard.

30
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Very lucky to kind of stumble into things.

31
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Been guided in certain situations.

32
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Been shoved in some directions.

33
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Made some good decisions along the way.

34
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Made some bad decisions.

35
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And been lucky enough to live through it and learn from it.

36
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So I've been very, very lucky.

37
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I also pay attention to these kind of things.

38
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
A lot of times I was paying attention to these kind of things.

39
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Because I was trying to teach them.

40
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I originally started paying attention to leadership because I had to learn it in order to become a leader.

41
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So I was paying attention to what watching what leaders were doing.

42
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And eventually I was paying attention to leadership because I was teaching it.

43
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And so I saw things.

44
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And I stumbled into things.

45
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And you know, one of the things I wrote about leadership strategy and tactics.

46
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I mean, my first platoon were clearing gas oil platforms.

47
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I do a big write up about this and in that book.

48
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
But my platoon ends up on a skirmish line.

49
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
We're all.

50
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
We're all looking down our weapons.

51
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Looking to engage targets and no one's making a call.

52
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
No one's making any kind of a decision.

53
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And I.

54
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
As a new guy.

55
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I take a step back.

56
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Which means I brought in my field of view.

57
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I look around so I can see more and I.

58
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
A nice calm comes over me.

59
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And now I can see what we need to do and I make a call.

60
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And I started to teach that.

61
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I started to teach that to young leaders.

62
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Hey, you need to take a step back.

63
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
You need to broaden your field of view.

64
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
You need to look around.

65
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And it's going to calm you down and allow you to make a decision.

66
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I also.

67
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
What tell guys.

68
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Hey, you need to take a breath.

69
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And I didn't have some, you know,

70
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I wasn't saying you need to take some spiritual transcendent breath.

71
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
You need to reach deep and hear inner soul and breathe.

72
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I wouldn't say in that.

73
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
The actual reason I was saying is because you don't want to sound panic.

74
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
When you come up on the radio.

75
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
You don't want to come up on the radio and say,

76
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I need to get everyone over this building.

77
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
You don't want to do that.

78
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
You don't want to do it.

79
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Number one because everyone else is going to now panic.

80
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And number two, because everyone's going to make fun of you.

81
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And you get back from this operation.

82
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So you don't want to either one of these.

83
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So when you have to make a decision,

84
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
you take a step back and then you take a breath.

85
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
You detach.

86
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
You broaden your field of view.

87
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And these things will calm you down and allow you to make better decisions.

88
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And recently,

89
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I've heard some podcasts.

90
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Tim Ferriss and Joe Rogan, by the way.

91
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
They've had a guy on a couple times.

92
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
They named Andrew Heberman.

93
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And this guy is a doctor, a neuroscientist, a professor.

94
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And as I was listening to what he was saying,

95
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
a lot of the things that I have been teaching

96
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
were aligned with what he was saying.

97
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And believe it or not, one of the things was a broad field of vision comes you down.

98
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Taking a breath is something that scientifically calms you down.

99
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Physiologically calms you down.

100
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And guess what?

101
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I know this, the calmer you are, the better decision you're going to make.

102
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Then there are other things when I listen to him talk that I recognize from my own experiences.

103
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Cold water.

104
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
But doesn't feel good when you get in it,

105
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
but it feels good when you get done,

106
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
lifting weights, fasting, things that I had kind of instinctively

107
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
or through trial and error, figure it out.

108
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:40.000
We're now being reinforced by someone that actually academically understood the science behind my instincts.

109
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Now my instincts are not always right by any stretch of the imagination.

110
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I should probably write an entire litany of books about the dumb things I've done.

111
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
But I'm always looking to see, hey, if there's some things I'm doing right, why are they right?

112
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I'm doing wrong, why are they wrong?

113
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And always looking to increase the understanding that I have behind the things that I think I've figured out,

114
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:20.000
which is why we are fortunate to have Dr. Andrew Huberman here with us tonight to help explain and explore what we think.

115
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
But we think we know what we think and how we can get better at all of the above.

116
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Andrew, thanks for coming down, man. It's good to meet you.

117
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Great to be here.

118
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Did that when I was listening to you talk and I was hearing you talk about how you're if you're focused on something small,

119
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
it amps up your adrenaline.

120
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I was listening to that as a little bit.

121
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Oh, it was all these things we're coming together, all these dots we're getting connected. It's kind of crazy, right?

122
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
It's pretty wild. I mean, I think some people may know this.

123
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Many people probably won't, which is that your eyes are too pieces of your brain.

124
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
They're the only two pieces of your brain. And yes, they are brain for those of you that want to look it up.

125
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
They're part of your central nervous system and they're outside your cranial vault.

126
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And they're there to set the aperture, right? The either tunnel vision or the broad field of view, not just on your vision, but on your thinking,

127
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
which is what you described.

128
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And widening your field of view, your visual aperture will allow you to parse more information.

129
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
It also changes your perception of time.

130
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:42.000
So the simplest way to put this is that when you are in a narrow field of view, it's a bit like having a video camera in slow motion.

131
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Your frame rate is higher, but in that small aperture, you're looking at minor details.

132
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
As soon as you hear, you think duh, of course.

133
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
But the opposite is also true when you broaden your field of view.

134
00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And that could be by literally moving your head around, but it can also just be by keeping your head more less stationary and just deliberately broadening your field of view.

135
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
You call it panoramic vision.

136
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:13.000
You are taking smaller frame rate, or I should say sorry, larger bins of time, but the way the visual system works is really clever.

137
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
It actually allows you to sense motion more quickly.

138
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000
So when you run and catch a ball, or when you're walking along, you blink and it be hits your eyelid, you didn't see it coming, see it in quotes.

139
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000
But you are in that panoramic field of view, and your reaction time is four times what it is when you're in that narrow aperture.

140
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Now, again, I just want to reiterate this and just clarify this.

141
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:49.000
For like 20 years, I have been teaching young seal leaders, and then, you know, other people in the world and the business world and the, in the first responder world in the military at large.

142
00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:00.000
For 20 years, I've been saying, hey listen, when things start to get wild, you need to get off your gun, you need to take a step back, you need to broaden your field of view, you need to look around to see what's happening.

143
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
I've been telling people that for 20 years, only because it just worked for me.

144
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And I luckily figured that out in my very first seal, but too.

145
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And it took me a while just to where I said, oh, that's something I need to tell other people to do.

146
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Like, I figured it out and would do it, but then once I was in position where I was teaching these things.

147
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So that's just like wild that there's all these physiological things that occur that for me was, I knew it.

148
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I knew it. I knew that you better do this.

149
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Because I mean, imagine you want to talk about a field of view. Imagine what your field of view is like when you're staring down the barrel of your gun.

150
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
It's tiny. Your field of view is so focused. And you don't see anything.

151
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
I mean, other than the target right in front of you, you don't see anything.

152
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And that's what happens to when when a young seal is in a leadership position.

153
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
That's what happens to them. They get, they're looking down their weapon and they don't see anything. That's happening.

154
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
They can't make any decisions because they don't see the entire picture.

155
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:06.000
They see nothing. So that's kind of crazy. And that's again, these are just some of the examples that I pulled from listening to you and listening to your podcast, by the way,

156
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Huberman Lab.

157
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Before we get down any more rabbit holes, let's talk about where you came from, how you ended up in this spot.

158
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Because I would say you didn't take sort of a standard route to end up where you ended up.

159
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
So let's talk about young Andrew Huberman. What's going on? Where are you born?

160
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I was actually born in Stanford Hospital. Oh, okay.

161
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
I joke. I was born in Stanford Hospital. I trained at Stanford. I work at Stanford. I'll probably die at Stanford.

162
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Hopefully a long time from now. People say you get to die in your office.

163
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
We're supposed to die in the Stanford.

164
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
How are you born there? Why?

165
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Yes, so my parents worked there. So my dad's from South America. He actually came here. He's a physicist, but he came here from Argentina on a Navy scholarship.

166
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
So the Navy page for my dad to leave Argentina where there were no opportunities to do science came to the US.

167
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
When did you ever see Pennsylvania? Over the years, he's worked on various projects related to government.

168
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I actually don't know what he's talking about. He does now.

169
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
But growing up, well, he met my mother in New York City, and she's from East Coast, from Jersey.

170
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And my grandfather went to college on the GI Bill. So he was a World War II vet.

171
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
My mom, while he was in graduate school, and he was a real physical guy.

172
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
That would come up later.

173
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Your dad was. My grandfather and my mom got it.

174
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
So my dad, my mom met move to California and had my sister and I.

175
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And this was a time I should say when Palo Alto is no dot com, no Silicon Valley.

176
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
In this scope of wealth in the Bay Area, we were middle class.

177
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
We weren't up in the middle class.

178
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
So we single single story home. I mean, we didn't want for things.

179
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
You know, I didn't imagine about having Ferrari or any of that.

180
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
But there were kids in the other high school. They're two high schools in Palo Alto.

181
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
I went to the one where all the nerdy kids went. It's actually called gun high school.

182
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And then it has a funny reputation, not funny. Has an infamous reputation.

183
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
It's the highest suicide rate of any high school in the United States.

184
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
For reasons that we can talk about.

185
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So from the time I was born until about age 13,

186
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I would say, I'm a magical childhood.

187
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
A bunch of young boys about my age lived down the street.

188
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Their older sisters, they all seem to have older sisters who were about my sister's age.

189
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And so it was biking around and skateboarding around playing baseball on the street,

190
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
soccer swimming. Those are big sports in the Bay Area.

191
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And we ate dinner together every night as a family.

192
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
You know, we just kind of have a great life.

193
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And this is so this is like this until you're around 13.

194
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Yeah, until as 13. And then my parents split up.

195
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
This was at a time in the 80s when I think I was only one other kid in school with the worst parents.

196
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Remember these times right now. It's rampant.

197
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
But unfortunately, they didn't have the skills to handle it properly.

198
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
So just imagine the rulebook of all the things parents aren't supposed to do in a divorce.

199
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
They basically systematically broke every one of those.

200
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
My dad moved away and was overseas for a bit.

201
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And I was at home with my mom and she struggled with the fracture of our family in a major way.

202
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
This was right about the time I hit puberty.

203
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
So it's like they're on gasoline on fire.

204
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Right. And at the time I was a bit indiscate boarding.

205
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
This was the early days of the bones brigade animal chin videos.

206
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Oh yeah. Okay. So for those of you that don't know, you can look it up and you get a sense.

207
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.000
But I quickly got into the skateboard community and dropped everything else.

208
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
I'll stop playing soccer.

209
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Really stop doing any kind of structured school sports and things of that sort.

210
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
And just really indiscate boarding.

211
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And the reason I got indiscate boarding was you didn't eat your dad to go.

212
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Socker, all the other kids had dads there.

213
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
My dad wasn't there. It was kind of embarrassing.

214
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
My mom would have gone.

215
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And actually she would have been the one shouting the loudest.

216
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
She's from Jersey after all. She's got teeth.

217
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
But you know, boy scouts wasn't going to be my thing.

218
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And some friends I went into Eagle Scouts.

219
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
I was playing lacrosse in water polo.

220
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
And you know, skateboarding made a lot more sense.

221
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And so what ended up happening was from about 13, 14, 15.

222
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
I started riding the 7F bus up to San Francisco.

223
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
There was a big gathering of kids in Justin Herman Plaza.

224
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
The now infamous famous EMB crowd, the embarked arrow.

225
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And this was a scene of very nascent scene at the time of young,

226
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
feral guys. It was almost exclusively guys.

227
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
That hung out there all day long. None of them went to school.

228
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
They drank 40 ounces and 40 ounces.

229
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And you know, people were smoking weed and drinking and skateboarding.

230
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And there were fights and people would rip off tourists.

231
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
It was, it was kind of a rough scene.

232
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
But there was also some amazing skateboarding.

233
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Now, I never really liked drugs or alcohol.

234
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
So I lucked out in that way.

235
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
For me it was all about the skateboarding.

236
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And over the years, you know, those early years of going up there.

237
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
I got to know a lot of guys.

238
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
I would say about a third of them have just to give you a sense of where it went.

239
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
About a third of them have gone on to found companies and do really well.

240
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
I'm fortunate to be friendly with guys like Danny Way.

241
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I talk to, you know, I remember the young rob dirt it coming through.

242
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And a lot of guys went on to create some impressive things.

243
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
And did very well.

244
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
About a third or just living their lives.

245
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And I don't know where they are.

246
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And about a full third of the guys I knew from back then are dead or in jail.

247
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
So saw a lot of fights, a lot of drinking, a lot of guys got their girlfriends pregnant.

248
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
It was a mix, you know.

249
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And I suppose looking back in that time I was kind of aimless, right?

250
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I wasn't that good a skateboard.

251
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I want to be really clear because a skateboarding community is kind of ruthless in terms of holding accountability.

252
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Almost as much of probably as much as in the teams, right?

253
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
I have a number of friends on the teams.

254
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Like you want to be very careful with what you impl- what one implies.

255
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
And so I don't want to imply that I was faded to become a Danny Way.

256
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And I didn't have the skills.

257
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Actually my body wasn't developed yet.

258
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
I kept getting hurt.

259
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
I was skinny.

260
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I kept breaking feet and getting hurt doing things that other guys could do trivially.

261
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
So that was really tough.

262
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And feeling like I couldn't keep up.

263
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
But all my friends were there.

264
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
And, you know, I could throw out a bunch of names.

265
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
But I would mention some of the brighter lights in that scene.

266
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
You know, I got to see and witness great skateboarding from a guy named Mike Carroll,

267
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
who's an incredible skateboarder.

268
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
And his older brother, Greg Carroll, was kind of a big brother to all these

269
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
parentless kids.

270
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
I also learned that going to school was an option for certain kids in the city.

271
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
And here I was this kid from Palo Alto and I thought, well, I just won't go any more.

272
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Well, what ended up happening was someone took notice.

273
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
And that I wasn't in school.

274
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And one day when I was back in high school, so it's a bit ninth grade.

275
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
I got called into the office and sitting down and they were talking to me.

276
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
And I was like, how are things at home?

277
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
How are things going?

278
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
They start probing.

279
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
There's this guy sitting in the corner.

280
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
And at some point, I realized, I think they're going to take me away.

281
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
So that's what ended up happening.

282
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
You know, how much school did you skip?

283
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Yeah.

284
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000
I could tell you more about the curves in the gun high school parking lot that I can tell you about any classes I took up until about the 11th grade.

285
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
And in the 11th grade, as the story goes, the only reason I really went there is because there was a girl in the 12th grade who was very beautiful,

286
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
who for whatever reason had a lapse of judgment and decided to go out with me.

287
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:31.000
And then ended up being my girlfriend and I'm grateful to her because as the story eventually goes, you know, that was the reason I went off to college at all, although that didn't go well either.

288
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
So I wasn't going much at all.

289
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
And so my grades were not good.

290
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
And your mom was just, was she working at this time?

291
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
What was she doing?

292
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
She's like, just she was working?

293
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Yeah, yeah, San Francisco and Skate all there. Yeah, allowing me an air quote.

294
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:56.000
I remember me and a guy who has gone on to do very well as a documentary filmmaker Jake Rosenberg, he actually made the waiting for lightning documentary about Danny Way.

295
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:05.000
And a couple of other guys took Jay Coves parents Volvo, Van again or whatever those wagon and things I forget what those are.

296
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
I don't know if they still made those are pretty cool.

297
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
And so that's the reason why I went to the Reno Nationals for a week mid exams.

298
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
You know, and just kind of went out there, I think we forged signatures.

299
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Kids don't do this, by the way, I'm a professor now, I just want to say for the record, wait to get your tattoos.

300
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Don't get the pull the earrings for reasons that don't even need explanation.

301
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
And please, please stay in school.

302
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:33.000
But when up there, I had me manage to get picked up by a wheel company in a truck company.

303
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
What truck company?

304
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Oh, yeah. And they put me on wheel company.

305
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
I was spitfire.

306
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Okay.

307
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
But you were like at least writing.

308
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
I could manage and getting free trucks.

309
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
That's all you're getting.

310
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Yeah, so there's a money.

311
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
No.

312
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
So gosh, because somewhere out there, the great Jim Thibau who owns Deluxe, which is real skateboarding,

313
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
and I'll ante here on all this, probably listening, thank you, Jim, he put me on out of sympathy.

314
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
I was hanging around the factory Deluxe.

315
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
So in San Francisco, there was an amazing thing about skateboarding that I'm guessing most people don't know,

316
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
which is this guy, Fausto Vatello, who started thrasher magazine.

317
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
And also independent trucks, the great independent trucks.

318
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
And then he had a brilliant idea, which was why don't we just make a bunch of companies,

319
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
thunder, spitfire, venture?

320
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
We'll guess what folks, it's all the same company.

321
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
And so kids, you know, you say, oh, I ride thunder's no-I ride in these, it's all ermico.

322
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
That's where they poured this stuff.

323
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
So during those years of high school, I started going up to the factory and hanging around the factory,

324
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
which is in Hunter's point, which is the only truly dangerous part of San Francisco.

325
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
At least at the time was the only truly dangerous part.

326
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
And it's a really watch yourself there.

327
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
I saw a guy get pushed off a motorcycle, beaten up in his motorcycle, taking a stop like midday.

328
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
This is, you know, this is a really rough box.

329
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
And so, you know, here I was this 14 year old kid from Palo Alto, getting a pretty quick, street education.

330
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Started getting to fight a little bit.

331
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Like I said, fortunately, didn't like drugs or alcohol because of it.

332
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
And you just randomly didn't like drugs or alcohol.

333
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Was there something in your parenting that made you feel that way?

334
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Did you not like the loss of control?

335
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
You know, it was probably the drugs and alcohol that I was exposed to.

336
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000
So alcohol made me feel kind of sedated as it does, as a forebrain inhibitor, as we'd say, in neuroscience.

337
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
And the drugs at the time people were mostly smoking weed and hash, taken LSD and mushrooms.

338
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
And none of that really appealed.

339
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
I mean, I do have a drug and it's adrenaline.

340
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
I love the clarity of mind and the energy that comes from adrenaline.

341
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:45.000
And I learned early on that beautiful but very dangerous edge where everything is clear.

342
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
You have immense amount of energy.

343
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
And if you can regulate a bit, you're incredibly calm.

344
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
And yet there's that readiness in your body.

345
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
I'm sure as I describe this many people and especially you guys will know this feeling very well.

346
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
And it's a very drug-like state.

347
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
It's as powerful as being in love and lust all at once.

348
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
It's just it's that it's a beautiful tunnel.

349
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
And I fell in love with it pretty early on.

350
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
And I also love camaraderie.

351
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
And my family quickly became this big group of feral kids.

352
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
And some older guys that really took care of all of us.

353
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
People like on home at night are you squatting somewhere?

354
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
So not sleeping on the street.

355
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
There were guys that slept in market air all the time.

356
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
I wasn't one of those.

357
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
I would stay at this guy Ray Myers house.

358
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
He was a skateboarder but also a computer programmer.

359
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
And this links back to that day where they were going to take me away.

360
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
I ended up leaving to the city.

361
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
So I bolted.

362
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
I messed up your story. That was your freshman year.

363
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
That was my freshman year maybe early sophomore year.

364
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
And you think these guys are going to take me.

365
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Right.

366
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
It made me into some kind of whatever.

367
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
So I took off.

368
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
I went to Ray's house.

369
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
I took bus up to San Francisco.

370
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
I bolted.

371
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
I think I said I had to use the bathroom.

372
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
And then they went obviously.

373
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
They weren't thinking.

374
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
I would know what to deal with.

375
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
And I went to Ray's house.

376
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
He lived in his parents' attic.

377
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
He was a computer programmer.

378
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
And also a professional skateboarder.

379
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
One of the more stable people in that world.

380
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
What year is this?

381
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
This would be 1989.

382
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
And you know, and I don't know anything like, well, I had shaved head.

383
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
And you know, and maybe my hair might have been dyed blue black or something.

384
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
And I was just excited because you know, I had whatever new pair of kicks on.

385
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
And was, oh, and the thunder thing.

386
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
If you rode for thunder back then, you got the shirt that is in my high school yearbook.

387
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
And I saw it the other day, which says, I ride for thunder trucks.

388
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
And all I got was this Laos E. T. Sherry.

389
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
And they only made a few over the home.

390
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
But if you have one of those out there, I'd love to love to see it.

391
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
But I went to Ray's and stayed there for a bit.

392
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
And at one point he said, you know, you can't stay here.

393
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
And I said, why not?

394
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
And he said, I live at home with my parents.

395
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Like, this is weird.

396
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
You live in my house.

397
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
You know, you have to go home.

398
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
So then she went back.

399
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
And then it was no forgiveness.

400
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
They took me to a place up the peninsula,

401
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
which was neither juvenile hall,

402
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
nor mental hospital, nor jail.

403
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
It was this kind of true and troubled kids place.

404
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
And I'll never forget what they told us.

405
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
They said, okay, there's an adult ward over there,

406
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
and they're crazy.

407
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
And then there are these little kids younger than you.

408
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
I think it was younger than 14 in this other building.

409
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
And they're really disturbed.

410
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
But you guys, you're normal.

411
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
You just have a lot of problems.

412
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
And I thought to myself, that's definitely what they're telling the people.

413
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
There's no things.

414
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
But what happened was I was on a 72 hour hold.

415
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
You know, I hadn't done anything.

416
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
I hadn't harmed anyone of myself.

417
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
So, and it was on the third day that one of the counselors there,

418
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
who was a really good guy.

419
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
You know, sometimes forget the people that do that kind of low income work

420
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
with kids like me back then, and kids now,

421
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
probably you didn't graduate school or something.

422
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
A lot of these people have their own set of problems,

423
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
and that's what led them there.

424
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
And he sat down and he said, listen, you can get out of here

425
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
and go right back to what you were doing.

426
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Or you can ask whether or not there's anything here of value.

427
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
And at the time I was pretty frightened.

428
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
I was in this place.

429
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
My roommate was this guy.

430
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
He looked like Richard Romeras the night stalker.

431
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Because if you haven't seen that documentary on that,

432
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
I'll make you never want to live in Los Angeles County.

433
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Although, Richard Romeras was happy to travel to kill you.

434
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
It turned out.

435
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
So I remember staying up at night and being really frightened.

436
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
I thought, I don't know, this guy's going to try and harm me

437
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
in any kind of way.

438
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Turned out he was just another sad story of somebody

439
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000
who was just really, really troubled.

440
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
He was really oddly.

441
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
He was one of the bigger, more dangerous looking guys in the place,

442
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
but he was cutting on the bottoms of his feet,

443
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
so that no one would see horrible.

444
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
And that's some good kids in there who, you know, had different sets of problems

445
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
and me, a lot of them, drug problems.

446
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Some of them had been molested.

447
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Fortunately, I never experienced that.

448
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000
You know, and, wow, like, I am in trouble, right?

449
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
I'm, I'm, I'm, this is a long way from home.

450
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
It's also a long way from embarking arrow.

451
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
I called my team manager.

452
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
I'm going to name him this time because we're friends now.

453
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
His name was Steve Ruggie, Shruggie.

454
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Really good guy.

455
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Team manager from Funderford.

456
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
I thought I'm going to.

457
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
I thought I'm going to.

458
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
And to like, and again, they put me on the flow team out of sympathy.

459
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Thank you, Steve.

460
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Thanks, Shrugg.

461
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
And I called him and I said, listen, they got me behind lock and key.

462
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
I don't know what to do.

463
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
And he said, you called me.

464
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
And I said, yeah, and he said, bro, you're the most normal guy I know.

465
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
And I said, I know.

466
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
And I'm in here and he said, no, including me.

467
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
I said, I can't help you.

468
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
And I thought, wow, I'm in trouble.

469
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
So what ended up happening was I was let out.

470
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
And as a condition of being let back in school,

471
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
I had to go to school at the chart a certain number of days.

472
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
And I was assigned to do therapy twice a week.

473
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
And at the time, no one did where if they did, they didn't talk about therapy.

474
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
This was a good, well-hunting.

475
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
This was before any kind of sense.

476
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Actually, as a little factoid, I saw some statistics out of Stanford.

477
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
I think it was college-wide statistics in the US that 10 years ago,

478
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
if you asked college students, how many of them go to or are willing to explore therapy,

479
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
or something like 14%.

480
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Now it's in excess of 90%.

481
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
We could argue whether or not that reflects a good or a bad change.

482
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
But anyway, I was assigned to a guy who was remarkable.

483
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
He really understood what I was going through,

484
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
which I have to imagine was just a stroke of luck.

485
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
He understood that my home life didn't have structure at the time

486
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
there was no strong paternal role.

487
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Even though my dad's a pretty strong-minded person,

488
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
I was strong in pinnies and Argentine after all,

489
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
just that I was spinning out.

490
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
I was going to be a very strong person.

491
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
He strongly discouraged me from doing any drugs,

492
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
because he understood that that was going to be a risk in my current configuration.

493
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
He understood that I wasn't going to get excited about school right away.

494
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
I was always a reader, so I was going to tower books and reading about fitness and reading about.

495
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
I loved to read about fitness.

496
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
I liked history, and I liked to read about sex.

497
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Not the porno magazines, but I would go read about sexual health.

498
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
I was like, I was like, I don't know.

499
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
I'm going to read about fitness, and I'm going to read about fitness.

500
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
I'm going to read about fitness, lifting weights,

501
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
like the Elington Garden books and the old super slow movement stuff.

502
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
And Mike Menser, and actually what happened was he said,

503
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
what do you enjoy doing?

504
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
I told him what my interest was, and he said, well, you should exercise.

505
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
He swims, I think, you know, you don't learn much about your therapist.

506
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
If it's appropriate therapy relationship.

507
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
So I started swimming about a mile a night.

508
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
I'd run to this pool, I'd hop the fence, because I'm a skateboarder.

509
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
I'd say I'd go in during the day.

510
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Fences are there to go over.

511
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
So I'd hop the fence and I'd swim at night.

512
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
And then I started running, and I started lifting weights.

513
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
And there was a teacher at our school as name as Bob Peters.

514
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Big guy football player, and he taught me out of lift weights.

515
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
And then I started running cross country.

516
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
And eventually I got a girlfriend.

517
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
I had done dating the skateboard way.

518
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Like there were girls that we meet at contests in the other thing.

519
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:26.000
A really nice smart, very sweet and kind girl who's dad actually was a real blue collar guy.

520
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
How much time has passed in it?

521
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
So now I'm 16 or so.

522
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
I get my drivers license.

523
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Soft more now.

524
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
I'm a junior.

525
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
I started school in the fall.

526
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
I was always the youngest in my class.

527
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
What do you think?

528
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
How did this therapist actually connect to you?

529
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Because most of the things I see with kids, your truly included when I was a kid of super rebellious kid.

530
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
I didn't listen to anybody.

531
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Like that was, you know, any adult just didn't know anything.

532
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
And how did you think that person made a connection with you?

533
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
It's a great question.

534
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
I don't ever ask me that.

535
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Three things.

536
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
One was completely nonverbal.

537
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
He was physically fit.

538
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
I looked at him and I thought,

539
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Yeah, I wouldn't mind looking like that dude someday.

540
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
You know, skinny and I kept getting hurt, skateboarding.

541
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
And I thought he wasn't really big and yoked,

542
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
but he was tall and fatty.

543
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
He had good posture and the way he would greet me was not.

544
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
He was kind of out of remember.

545
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
He had his, uh, so he's kind of a badass.

546
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Yeah, and he had his initial stitch into his socks.

547
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
I was like, I guess he probably makes a good money doing this.

548
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
But he wasn't, um,

549
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
there was no aristocracy about him.

550
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
He just, um,

551
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Yeah, he, he looked like the kind of person.

552
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
I might want to be.

553
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
He looked like he had his life together.

554
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
I also remember that one day I came in and he said you're smiling.

555
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
And I said, yeah, I'll lead the front eight.

556
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
And he said, what does that mean?

557
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
And I said, well, I do this thing and he said,

558
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
I want you to show me.

559
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
So we went downstairs.

560
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
I did push push push.

561
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
I think I fell a few times.

562
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
And then I, you know, clicked down this front eight.

563
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
We went upstairs and I was like, wow.

564
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
I think that's the first time that, like, a grown man has cared about what I was doing.

565
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Um, and so there was that seed there.

566
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Um, this is the first time I remember that very clearly now.

567
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Um, and then he, I remember falling asleep in this office a lot.

568
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
You know, I must have been pretty out of it at times.

569
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
And then when I met my girlfriend, um, she was a year older.

570
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
I was a little intimidated.

571
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
You know, it's a whole other thing when you're just traveling.

572
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
And I guess they call, you know, you're just hooking up with girls or whatever.

573
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
But when you actually like somebody now,

574
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
they've got something to lose, right?

575
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000
And he really encouraged me to, he said, uh, great advice.

576
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
By the way, he said, when it comes to decision making,

577
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
ask her opinion, but I think she'll appreciate if you just make the plans.

578
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Hmm.

579
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
All right.

580
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
So I would pick the restaurant.

581
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
I would restaurant back then.

582
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
I had no money, right?

583
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
But in terms of, um, you know, so I used to run to my girlfriend's house and

584
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
wash her car sheet of bronco.

585
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
And I was very, very excited to see her wash her as a church on Sundays.

586
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Her dad was a blue collar guy, very little education,

587
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
but had done okay in this country by buying apartments and then taking care of them themselves.

588
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
And when he's guys with, I remember he had a hundred keys on his key.

589
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Always a sign that somebody works hard, right?

590
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Just remembering what all those keys are to.

591
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Some memory task.

592
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
What, what do you, what do you listen to from music right now?

593
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
So as you start talking about this,

594
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
and I'm sitting here running through my life and thinking about,

595
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
well, what kind of people had influence over me?

596
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
And there was like a one of one guy that I knew his older brother was a Marine Corps.

597
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Was in the Marine Corps and was a Marine Corps general instructor.

598
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
And you know, in my mind when I was like 13 years old,

599
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
my saw that, I was like, okay, that dude looks like he can kick ass.

600
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
And that seems like a good thing to be able to do.

601
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
And then, you know, as I started listening to hardcore music and all of a sudden,

602
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
you know, you, you know,

603
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
and we roll and black flag is like doing pushups.

604
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
And you think, okay, that looks like I need to start doing some pushups.

605
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000
And then, other, some other hardcore bands where you know that the guys are working out.

606
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
And I remember, like, my friends and me were like, okay, well,

607
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
looks like we're working out. Why?

608
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Because it's, it's interesting.

609
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
You brought up like the, kind of the posture in the stature.

610
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Because when you're a kid and you're 13 and you weigh 138 pounds or whatever,

611
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
you see someone that's like 190 pounds.

612
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
And they kind of look like, like you said,

613
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
that's kind of what I think I should be doing.

614
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Even though it's an interesting thing, I heard, I heard,

615
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
I think it was either Rollins or Ian McCuy, McKay.

616
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
And they were talking about seeing HR from the bad brains.

617
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
And HR from the bad brains was like older.

618
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
You know, because they were rounding them in the late 70s,

619
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
but he had been an athlete HR from the bad brains.

620
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Had been an athlete in like high school.

621
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000
He was like a track athlete.

622
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
That's how come he could do these flips.

623
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
But they like looked at him and he looked like a man,

624
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
like a jacked guy and they're like, yes.

625
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
And so that again, you see these,

626
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
it's an interesting thing that little physical,

627
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
a stature means something apparently.

628
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Yeah, these, I guess, you know,

629
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
this psychologist, we have to ask Jordan, you know,

630
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
these masculine archetypes.

631
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
They, you get a seed going there, you know,

632
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
it's, there are a couple things.

633
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000
One important person that I failed to mention,

634
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
the guy that sold me my first skateboard,

635
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
it's kind of a Gary Hall.

636
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
And ran the skateboard shop and was an interesting guy

637
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
because he's very physically strong,

638
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
plays hockey, but also skateboard.

639
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Actually, it was a professional skateboarder

640
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
and they kind of late 70s or early 80s.

641
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
He took early on when he saw me going off the rails

642
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
because he used to skateboard with him a lot.

643
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
He said, listen, your parents are going through a lot.

644
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Whatever you do, do not mess your life up.

645
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
By not going to school, not getting a job doing all these things.

646
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
So I didn't follow his advice as well as I could of,

647
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
but Gary and I have remained close friends

648
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
for kind of came in count of years.

649
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Now more than 35 years.

650
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Little, little story here.

651
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
He, he's actually the operations manager

652
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
from my laboratory at Stanford.

653
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
And he's a very put together guy.

654
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
If you walk past him on the street,

655
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
you wouldn't even know he skateboards.

656
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
But he was very in to, you know,

657
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
for instance, I've never seen a leaf on his front lawn.

658
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
It's edged perfectly.

659
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
My laboratory, I'm very proud to say,

660
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
and thank you Gary, has passed every single inspection

661
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
with 100%.

662
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Nobody does that.

663
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
They're gonna find something.

664
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
And he makes sure they don't.

665
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
So there were examples of people like that

666
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
or my therapist, but that I thought,

667
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
wow, I would love to be like that person.

668
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
But I somehow couldn't find the internal organization

669
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
to do it.

670
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000
You asked about music.

671
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
One thing that was just terrible

672
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
about the early 90s, about skateboarding.

673
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
It was the era of little wheels

674
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
and people wearing really baggy clothes with,

675
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
you know, bright colors with fruit salad on the front.

676
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
And it would be a few years before the Danny Ways

677
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
and those guys would come in,

678
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
like blasting slayer in ACDC

679
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
and jumping over a great wall of China.

680
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
But really bringing, it was almost like,

681
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
we had everyone, it was like a pre-puburral phase

682
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
of skateboarding, which then eventually went through

683
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
puberty and some incredible stuff happen.

684
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
So the music at the time that kids in my high school

685
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
were listening to was also to me was just dreadful.

686
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000
No disrespect to anybody.

687
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
But I mean, people were like hacky-sacky

688
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
and listening to fish.

689
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
And they are, you know, sure the grateful dead

690
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
would play at Frost Ampatheter at Stanford

691
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
and we'd go over there for other reasons.

692
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
But it just, totally smell.

693
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
And like none of that stuff resonated for me.

694
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
And then, what happened was I was 14

695
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
and Jim Thibau of Deluxe and has great fame

696
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
and he said, very quiet humble guy,

697
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
but he's sort of the secret parent of all skateboarding.

698
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
He can look him off.

699
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
He's a very important figure still to this day

700
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
and a great person.

701
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
I was up at Spitfire Thunder,

702
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
the place was called Deluxe, Low Warehouse.

703
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
And he gave me a tape.

704
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
And it was a ban called crimp shrine,

705
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
which is an East Bay punk ban.

706
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
And that led me to the discovery of the great operation Ivy.

707
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000
And then Operation Ivy was featured

708
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
in the first H Street video.

709
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
The entire album of 27 songs and Operation Ivy

710
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Jesse Michaels and Tim Armstrong,

711
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
which is now a rancid fame and transplants

712
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
with Travis Barker, okay, and on and on and on.

713
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
So when I heard Operation Ivy,

714
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
I was, wow.

715
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000
I mean, I can still feel it in my body now.

716
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Just, I'm not gonna try and sing it, but just here's like,

717
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
you know, I got no idea.

718
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
It's just so, the energy was so much like,

719
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
that's me, that's me.

720
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
It's like singing someone on the street that looks just like you.

721
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
And it's a feeling inside you, that's me.

722
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
And then Operation Ivy, I went to gym and I said,

723
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
what do we, where can I get more of this?

724
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
And you know, if you like that, stiff little fingers.

725
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
I know it's like stiff little fingers.

726
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Yeah, it's gonna be a little bit of a...

727
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
I'm fortunate the Operation Ivy won the album.

728
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Yeah, so that, they had that energy,

729
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
it's really long, yeah, they broke up because they were a bunch of teenagers touring

730
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
and they had this huge success.

731
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Now, fortunately, that led to the great, I mean, my favorite band of all time,

732
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
and it tremendous respect and love and admiration and appreciation for Rancid.

733
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
So if you were going to, in my mind,

734
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
if you were going to design a punk band or a band of any kind,

735
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
you'd have a bullet-belted mohawk-eye upfront, that's Tim,

736
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000
with all this, but like he actually is missing a piece of that front tooth.

737
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000
And then you'd have an amazing bass player like Matt Freeman,

738
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
who's like a big, you know, card guy.

739
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
And then you'd have a drummer like Brett Reed,

740
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
who actually used to skateboard with us at the Embarket Arrow.

741
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000
I remember thinking like, no one had tattoos back then,

742
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
it was what we call the AutoClave days.

743
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Now these disposable needles back then, it was actually dangerous,

744
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
because if they actually ran the AutoClave,

745
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
or if they were so over-wall they did it,

746
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
and he had a huge spider tattoo on his chest,

747
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
and we're like, whoa, that's a commitment.

748
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
And then you'd have Lars Frederson, an OIGI, right,

749
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
from the South Bay, from San Jose.

750
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
And I remember the first time I heard Ransse,

751
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
which was the first to three-piece, and then when they added Lars,

752
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
and I thought, this is like Operation Ivy graduated,

753
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
and went to college, which no, I was guys did.

754
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
They get what I'm talking about, but just so much energy,

755
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
like the albums would open with, ah,

756
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
and once again, I thought, and I was maturing,

757
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
right, it gone through, I was going through puberty, and I thought, this.

758
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
This is it, and actually I have to say that throughout my entire life,

759
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
every Ransse album has trapped to a particular five-year phase of my life,

760
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
and I could go on and on about this, and I won't,

761
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
but I own every B track, every outtake.

762
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
I mean, I've even got a song by Ransse called The Sentence,

763
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
which nobody knows, which is queued up in my phone,

764
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
so that if I'm on a plane, it starts to go down,

765
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
as much as I love the people of my life,

766
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000
I'm plugging in, and I'm going down, listening to the sentence.

767
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
So that was all during those years, and then the fitness thing

768
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
really took off because of this, I got football coach,

769
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Bob Peters, and then because my girlfriend at the time,

770
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
she was a year older, she had dated a guy that someone showed me a picture

771
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
of him, he was this big football player from the other high school,

772
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
and I was six foot tall at that time, 150 pounds,

773
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
oh my goodness, she must think I'm a dental floss, right?

774
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
So I started doing my sit-ups and my push-ups,

775
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
and then I started lifting cans of soup, like,

776
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
cosy thing, and then I saw an ad from Mike Menser,

777
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000
in a magazine, and I paid, I was working at the time,

778
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
so I started working at a cafe, you know,

779
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
busing tables and things like that, and I got a program from Mike Menser,

780
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000
and got on the phone with him, and he said, listen,

781
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
he got on the phone with Mike.

782
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
I paid him, yeah.

783
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
I paid him, and he explained high intensity training

784
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
and bring you muscles to failure, and so I started doing this thing,

785
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
of training once, everything, and how much did that cost?

786
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000
That's probably about 100 bucks at the time.

787
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
That's great.

788
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
It's been a huge investment, Mike Menser.

789
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Huge investment for me.

790
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
And people did eat through that for.

791
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Well, this is a business.

792
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
I remember I had to go to Western Union and send them Western Union,

793
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000
no one's not.

794
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000
That's great.

795
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
And my mother, I remember when he called,

796
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
why is this grown man calling you?

797
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000
And I started doing the, you know, once,

798
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
train, rest two days, train, rest two days,

799
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
and my body just responded like crazy to that.

800
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
So I was eating and training and just growing like a weed,

801
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
and as most people know, when you're untrained,

802
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
and you start training, even a slight, you know,

803
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
training hard, you just grow.

804
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
And when you're held, I was, so that was 17,

805
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000
so I was, your body's just saving with testosterone.

806
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000
So from this G.A. to whatever, everything.

807
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
I mean, from, and from the 16 until,

808
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
I guess when I started, I eventually followed that high school

809
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
girlfriend off to college.

810
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
I went from 150 pounds to 215 in a period of about,

811
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000
you know, three, three years or so.

812
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
It wasn't all solid, but it was solid enough.

813
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000
I still had the baby fat around, around your face,

814
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
but, and I was sprinting and lifting.

815
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000
And then basically, and are you now back in school?

816
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Are you paying attention to school?

817
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
So here's the irony.

818
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
I got a girlfriend.

819
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000
I died my hair back to a normal color.

820
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
I started wearing flannels instead of the skateboard gear.

821
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
And you dressed like a skateboarder in the 90s,

822
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
like you were wearing those big jeans and stuff.

823
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000
There are photos of those out there.

824
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
There are a few videos.

825
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000
I know, I didn't wear the super baggies.

826
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
I got out before that.

827
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
You were dating to your clothes.

828
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
That was the intro.

829
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
I was dating to your clothes.

830
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000
It's true.

831
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Very embarrassing, garb, which is coming back.

832
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000
It's coming back for me.

833
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
I guess I was a generation before that,

834
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000
because I guess I'm five years old or six years old in New.

835
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
So when I got thrash your magazine,

836
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
it was like nothing but hardcore and metal.

837
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
And matter of fact, my name,

838
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
my subscription to thrash your magazine,

839
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
for whatever reason the way I wrote my name

840
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
when I mailed in the thing,

841
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000
they sent it to Volco-Willink.

842
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
The way I wrote that is so.

843
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
They got files on me at thrash your magazine.

844
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
They used to send the magazine to Volco-Willink.

845
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000
But there was no, it was like hardcore.

846
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
And that was it.

847
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Man, it was as it was total rebellion.

848
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
It was absolute rebellion.

849
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000
And that's the way.

850
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
And that's how you discovered music.

851
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Yeah, that's where I got, that's where I picked up a lot of music.

852
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
And started seeing that and having that attitude.

853
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
And that rebellion's attitude has suited me very well

854
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000
for my whole life.

855
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Most of the time, it's worked out.

856
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Sometimes it's been a little bit much, but yeah, then,

857
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
so I joined the Navy.

858
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
And that's when, you know,

859
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000
unfortunately for you, you got roped into big baggy pants.

860
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
It stopped right there.

861
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
It was pretty bad.

862
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Yeah.

863
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Well, and I stopped skateboarding and started working out.

864
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
And I got into Moetai.

865
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Okay.

866
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
I started actually opening the doors on this Moetai place.

867
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
So they let me train there for free.

868
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
It was in San Jose.

869
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
I think it still exists.

870
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
The Moetai Academy.

871
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
And it was interesting.

872
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
There were a lot of cops that train there and bodyguard training.

873
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
They had some weapons training.

874
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
So now I'm hanging around with a different group of guys.

875
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Still liked fighting.

876
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Still had a lot of aggression, but I wasn't skateboarding.

877
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000
I was hanging out with my girlfriend.

878
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
You ever get your ass beaten these fights?

879
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
You know, I'm lucky that over the years I've never been knocked down or knocked out.

880
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
But I've definitely taken hits.

881
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
And, you know, there's that.

882
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
I always say the amazing thing about adrenaline is that

883
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000
when you get in a fight, it's amazing how little it hurts during the fight and how much it hurts afterwards.

884
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.000
So definitely experience the clarity of getting hit and feeling ultra clear.

885
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000
And again, I don't recommend it to people, especially as you've pointed out many times on your podcast.

886
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
And I appreciate that you do this.

887
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000
You know, you can hit someone just right and it's all fair and square.

888
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
And they can, you know, plug and kill you or the person next to you.

889
00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000
And, or, and this all tell a story that that unfortunately happened, you know,

890
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
when I went off, basically I went off to college because the girlfriend went to college.

891
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
She went to UC Santa Barbara and I was going down there in my senior year,

892
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
literally sleeping in my car in the parking lot.

893
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000
She was my family.

894
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
So you're senior year of high school?

895
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Yeah, so she started in college.

896
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000
So what happened was she was a year ahead of me.

897
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
So my junior year I started hanging out with her.

898
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000
You asked if I was going to school.

899
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000
I was going, I was dressing the part more of a normal person.

900
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
But unfortunately, I was still really challenged in school.

901
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
I didn't have the skills.

902
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
I hadn't barely, I barely gone in the early years.

903
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
I was reading and I was smart enough to kind of get by,

904
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
but I wasn't doing very well.

905
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
And I thought, what am I going to do with myself?

906
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000
And she's going to college soon.

907
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000
I'm sure.

908
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000
And I decided to say fire science class is down at Mission College,

909
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000
become a firefighter.

910
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000
I like hanging out with a bunch of dudes and lifting weights and I love the come rotty.

911
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
And I want to make a living.

912
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
And, you know, she's the one drives the bronco.

913
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
I don't even have a car.

914
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
How am I going to get a car or a truck?

915
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000
You know, I mean, how am I going to live?

916
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
And so I started thinking about my future a bit,

917
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
but that was as far as I was thinking out.

918
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Then I somehow managed to graduate.

919
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
Don't ask me how.

920
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000
And she went off to college.

921
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
And so in that year where she was a year ahead of me,

922
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000
and I was a senior, I was going down a Santa Barbara to visit her quite a lot.

923
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Sleeping in the parking lot, getting into mischief of various kinds.

924
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000
But basically, just wanted to be as close to her as I could.

925
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
And then I decided, I would apply to college.

926
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000
And the reason was there was a counselor at mission who said,

927
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
well, you know, you can go into the fire service without college degree,

928
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
but if you have a college degree, there are some opportunities that open up for you in there that you wouldn't have otherwise.

929
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
So I was still in therapy, talked to my therapist.

930
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000
I think it'd be a good idea.

931
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000
You seemed to have a mind that wants to consume a lot of knowledge.

932
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:46.000
So I took the SAT and by some stroke of luck, I, you know,

933
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
broke a thousand, which, you know, for gun high school would be considered like the low end,

934
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000
because everyone there is like, you know, perfect as the only score that it was.

935
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000
It was acceptable.

936
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
And then there was me, you know, and I wrote my college entrance,

937
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
I say saying that I'd like to run a station house some day and become a firefighter.

938
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000
I told a little bit of my story.

939
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000
It wasn't a sob story or this and that, you know, I just told my story.

940
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000
And I got in.

941
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
So I go to UC Santa Barbara.

942
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
She's now living off campus.

943
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
I'm staying with her.

944
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000
I think I had her bed in the dorms.

945
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
I show up with what you got into UC Santa Barbara?

946
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000
I did.

947
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Okay, so yeah, which at the time I think the standards for getting in were lower than they are now.

948
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:29.000
It's super competitive and all UCs now, but got in and it was a total disaster.

949
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000
Getting in fights, I got the lifting weights part down.

950
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
I would go for runs.

951
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
I was training and I'm going to tie to Jim downtown.

952
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Found someone who would hold bags for me and would spar with me a little bit.

953
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Even made some money teaching some self-defense classes on campus and things like that.

954
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.000
You know, and the girlfriend and I are now starting to fracture, mostly because I was like,

955
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
wow, there are a lot of other attractive women here.

956
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
And not good.

957
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.000
I will say this guys, if there is a woman who is really beautiful dedicated sweet and kind

958
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:04.000
and it's early, it is worth investing in those early relationships and going through some developmental milestones together.

959
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000
If you think you'd have to break up just to explore, think twice.

960
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Talk to me first because she would have been a great choice, but I was distracted.

961
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
And then I started, I got thrown out of the dorms for fighting.

962
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000
I had a guy.

963
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000
You're not.

964
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000
You don't drink still.

965
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000
I drank a little bit the first year and then, you know, I, not so much.

966
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
For me, it was, I've never really needed to drink.

967
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:30.000
So if I go out, listen to music, I'm still going to punk rock shows, always, always, always.

968
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000
And I'd go to parties and, you know, it was fun.

969
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
You know, people were drinking and having a good time, but I wasn't really into drinking.

970
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000
And I could say whatever I wanted to say without it.

971
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:46.000
I think I just always had that kind of wild side in me that I didn't need to drink in the order.

972
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000
So you're still getting in fight even though you're not drinking because drinking leads to a lot of fighting.

973
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
Yeah, so I don't have that excuse.

974
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.000
The, yeah, I pulled the fire alarm in our building because he was done with finals and you was celebrating.

975
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
I remember, wake jumping out of bed because I need my sleep because you grow when you sleep.

976
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Running out there and grabbing him and hitting him.

977
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Those kinds of, that kind of stupidity.

978
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
He stuck a key through my cheek.

979
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000
It was actually this cheek.

980
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
I remember things someone said, you have blood on your face.

981
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000
I said, he's got his blood on my face.

982
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Not like, you're bleeding.

983
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000
This kind of thing, just young stupidity, 19 years old, or 18 years old.

984
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
And then what happened was, and that summer she moved home.

985
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
And I decided to stay in that little town of Ilevista.

986
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
And I didn't pay rent.

987
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000
I just, skateboarder, just, these, and none of these houses are locked.

988
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Just stay in one.

989
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000
So I was staying in one.

990
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
I was delivering bagels for the bagel cafe driving,

991
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
then I will truck in the fourth or third year in the morning.

992
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Come home, sleep, get up and go find a barbecue and hang out.

993
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000
skateboard.

994
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
I do whatever, work out.

995
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000
And it was fourth of July, 1994, remember this very well.

996
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000
And we went to go, the store to pick up some stakes.

997
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000
We were driving back.

998
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000
And there were some guys coming out of the house with a bunch of stuff.

999
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Surfboard, skateboards.

1000
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000
And one of the guys in our car said the usual thing.

1001
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000
He said, oh, let's get on.

1002
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000
Let's beat him up.

1003
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000
I was like, no, no, that's not how you do it.

1004
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Right?

1005
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000
And if you just say, I'm going to beat you up.

1006
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000
This is the bad tactics.

1007
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Right?

1008
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Here I'm talking to you guys about fighting.

1009
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000
This isn't music.

1010
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000
That also is the first podcast I've ever been except the one with Joe Runger.

1011
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000
I'm the smallest person in the room.

1012
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Joe's a big guy as you know.

1013
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.000
He's thick.

1014
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:25.000
So what ended up happening is there was a big fight between a bunch of guys and us and the whole thing.

1015
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000
And it was like knives and bottles.

1016
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000
And it worked out in the sense that no one got cut or killed.

1017
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Please show it up.

1018
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000
And I'll never forget this.

1019
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.000
The cop came up to me and he said, and big crowded assembled and people.

1020
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000
And I'd done it.

1021
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Were these guys when they were walking?

1022
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Were they were they jacking stuff?

1023
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Yeah, they were stealing stuff.

1024
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000
They were stealing stuff.

1025
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000
And you know, and I hit a guy and the whole thing.

1026
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000
And like, and I ended up on my feet and then there was a huge crowd.

1027
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
And a couple of guys I was with ran away.

1028
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000
He was like, let's get him.

1029
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000
But then when they come out with bottles of knives, it's like,

1030
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000
out of town.

1031
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000
And so, please show it up and I'll never forget this.

1032
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
The cop said, good job.

1033
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000
And I remember feeling just the worst sunken feeling in my stuff.

1034
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000
I thought like, good job.

1035
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000
I mean, first I just, it all kind of fell into place.

1036
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000
I was like, I'm 19 girlfriends gone.

1037
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
And I don't have a job.

1038
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
I'm not doing well in school.

1039
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000
I'm getting, I'd actually been thrown out of the dorms for fighting.

1040
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.000
And some other just stupidity.

1041
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
And you know, I'm getting in fights.

1042
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000
I could have cut someone and someone cut me.

1043
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000
I could be dead or in jail.

1044
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.000
It could be like one of the stories from the market era of the guys that didn't make it.

1045
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000
That didn't escape where they're just hung out drinking and partying and fighting all day.

1046
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000
And I remember going back to my place at night and thinking, this is it.

1047
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Like this is the line.

1048
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.000
I need to do something.

1049
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000
I'm basically a loser.

1050
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000
And I was a total loser.

1051
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
And I thought, what am I going to do?

1052
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:54.000
Well, I hadn't seen minuses and d's in all my classes up until then at Santa Barbara.

1053
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000
Barely finished high school.

1054
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000
And so, I decided to take a leave of absence.

1055
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000
I did not drop out.

1056
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000
I took a leave of absence.

1057
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000
I moved home.

1058
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000
And I went to Fuhill College Community College.

1059
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000
And I didn't talk to any of my old friends from the skateboarding world.

1060
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000
It was just two familiar with a bunch of things.

1061
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000
I didn't talk to my family.

1062
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000
I lived in a little apartment and I just started studying.

1063
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
I thought, what am I good at?

1064
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Okay.

1065
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
I can remember things pretty well.

1066
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000
I like to read.

1067
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000
This is it.

1068
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
And I remember thinking my dad's an academic.

1069
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000
So I thought, you know, I'm not going to do this.

1070
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000
That'll just validate what he does and his choices.

1071
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Well, that's stupid.

1072
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000
All right. So I started working and I did okay in my courses to art history.

1073
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000
I told you it took psychology.

1074
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Then I went back to Santa Barbara.

1075
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.000
And I had this reputation in Santa Barbara at that time as a guy that was fun to have at parties.

1076
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Because something fun was going to happen.

1077
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000
You know, something wild was going to happen or there'd be a big fight.

1078
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:58.000
You know, you're the guy getting noseed up to the front to take the damage or do the damage for entertaining other people's entertainment.

1079
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000
So I went back and I lived in the studio Plaza apartments.

1080
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000
I still have a photo of that door because it has great meaning for me.

1081
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000
I lived in the corner there.

1082
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000
I lifted weights.

1083
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
I studied like a maniac.

1084
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
And I did not drink or party except once a month.

1085
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000
I'd allow myself to go out.

1086
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000
And I would really, you know,

1087
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
I would just stay out all night party.

1088
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000
But over time when I realized this, I didn't like it because then it made the rest of the week that much harder.

1089
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000
So in those years, I discovered a guy an amazing person.

1090
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:33.000
He was Harry Carlisle, former Navy guy in Sanley, Randall Abertory and taught classes.

1091
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000
And he was teaching about, at the time there was no neuroscience.

1092
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000
He was teaching about psychology and biology.

1093
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000
They called it bio-psychology.

1094
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000
And about how depression was based on these things called neurotransmitters.

1095
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:49.000
And it's a frania which I'd seen some of in this, you know, in my years.

1096
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000
No neuroscience didn't exist at this time.

1097
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.000
There was no field of neuroscience.

1098
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000
There was a chemistry physiology.

1099
00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:00.000
But so this is the mid-90s now, 94.95 or so.

1100
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000
And he was teaching about the brain and how it works.

1101
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000
And then he was talking about thermal regulation.

1102
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000
And he was talking about why people die at Raves.

1103
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.000
He said, I heard of these things called Raves.

1104
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000
And the people taking this drug and he break down the structure of MDMA,

1105
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:17.000
ecstasy and explain how it would disrupt the hypothalamus and one's perception about how it was.

1106
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.000
And this is why people would overheat even if they were pouring water on themselves.

1107
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000
As a little scientific factoid, when you're overheating in the desert or while training,

1108
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000
you might think, I'll put a coltal over my head or the back of my neck.

1109
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Well, that's like putting a coltal on a thermostat.

1110
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
Because you have a thermostat in your brain.

1111
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000
What happens when you put a coltal on the thermostat?

1112
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.000
The thermostat turns on the heat.

1113
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
That's how you overheat and die.

1114
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:42.000
Turns out the best way to dump heat is through the palms of your hands and the bottoms of your feet.

1115
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000
You have a special vignus portals called AVA's, where you can dump heat.

1116
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:50.000
So if you want a cool off fast, in fact, you can save your life by getting the bottoms of your bare feet.

1117
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Or the palms of your hands into cool water.

1118
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.000
We can talk about how this can be leveraged for training because there's some amazing research on this.

1119
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
So I was learning about thermal regulation.

1120
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:04.000
And I was learning about drugs of abuse and why some of my friends were addicts, probably,

1121
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000
was this pathways related to dopamine, et cetera, et cetera.

1122
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000
I thought, oh, who is this guy?

1123
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.000
So I started talking to him and he drove a black truck and he was in shape.

1124
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000
And I thought, I want to be like this guy.

1125
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000
And so I started hanging around his lab and he would drink black coffee.

1126
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000
And he let me listen to whatever music I wanted after hours.

1127
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000
And we started doing experiments.

1128
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000
I started working in a laboratory.

1129
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:33.000
And he pulled me aside at one point and he said, you know, you seem to have some proficiency for this.

1130
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000
You know, if you go to graduate school, they'll pay you.

1131
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000
And I thought, they pay you to do this.

1132
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
And he said, yeah, they'll pay you to do it.

1133
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000
He didn't tell me how much they pay you.

1134
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000
But basically what happened was, make a long story short.

1135
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000
No more fighting was never into the drugs or alcohol, as I mentioned.

1136
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.000
I was not going to get back to the other with the girlfriend.

1137
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000
But I went from a CD student to a straight A student.

1138
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000
I got to be plus my senior year and it still pisses me off.

1139
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000
But that was in neuro anatomy, which is now what I teach to medical students.

1140
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000
It became my favorite topic.

1141
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000
I went on to take multiple courses and it's always that one thing that didn't quite get you.

1142
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000
I think Dan Gable talks about this in wrestling is the one guy that I think it is where it's gum beat out.

1143
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
And then pinned him or beat him by point.

1144
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
That one guy that teaches you the most.

1145
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000
Right.

1146
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:20.000
A student went on to graduate with honors, went to graduate school first at Berkeley and then did my PhD.

1147
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000
And then did my postdoc at Stanford and so on and so forth.

1148
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000
I will say over the years, I kept in touch with various people in the skateboard community.

1149
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.000
And then when I was a postdoc, which is kind of like a residency between your PhD and

1150
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Professorship, I was at Stanford and I was working extremely hard.

1151
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000
I've always had a capacity to work long hours.

1152
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Actually, I have a, I hope the insurance companies don't mind me saying this, but it would only hurt me.

1153
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000
I have a mutation in a, and then the dream-over-lated gene.

1154
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.000
So I probably make a little bit, I probably have the capacity to make a little bit more adrenaline.

1155
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Then most, I can get by on very little sleep, at least for a couple nights.

1156
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000
I'm guessing a lot of team guys might have this.

1157
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000
It's a pretty common mutation about 12% of males have it.

1158
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
So I can do fine with one night no sleep.

1159
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Second night, I'm kind of falling apart a bit.

1160
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.000
But if I need to take a one hour nap and bounce right back in, I'm good.

1161
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000
I don't recommend it.

1162
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000
I try and get my good sleep now.

1163
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:15.000
But so I was just work work, work, lift lift, lift, run, run, run, just repeat.

1164
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.000
So you graduate from Santa Barbara?

1165
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Yeah, that's right.

1166
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
And then you go from there to Berkeley?

1167
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000
I go to Berkeley and the first week at Berkeley,

1168
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000
Rances playing at the Greek theater.

1169
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.000
Oh, how are you?

1170
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000
So I'm there and I'm still doing that.

1171
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000
I'm still in it, but I'm not, but I'm the guy now on the side lines.

1172
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Just happy to be there.

1173
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.000
And then eventually I did my PhD, my graduate advisor moves.

1174
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:43.000
I went up to Davis and I worked for an incredible woman up there who is just a really, really good scientist.

1175
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.000
She was just extremely rigorous.

1176
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Give me a lavin, some keys to the lab, show me where things were and said, listen,

1177
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000
I'm going to have a couple kids in the next few years.

1178
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:55.000
And the best thing I can do for you is to be available when you need me, but figure it out.

1179
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000
Don't burn the lab down, don't kill yourself, go for it.

1180
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000
And so it's like, you kidding me?

1181
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000
There was no one else in there.

1182
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000
I thought it, and this was perfect.

1183
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:10.000
Ten foil on the windows, lock the doors, ranted blasting all day, ignore the knocks on the door and just do experiments experiments.

1184
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000
We published ten papers together.

1185
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
We'll kind of experiment.

1186
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Okay, so it can be an example.

1187
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
So at the time, I'm thinking like,

1188
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Eight great, I was like, sure, I drew gin peroxide.

1189
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000
So yeah, little disclaimer.

1190
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Now my laboratory mainly focuses on humans, but the time we're using animal models.

1191
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:33.000
So at the time, and listen, I have mixed feelings about this for the time we were doing experiments on carnivores in

1192
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.000
the past, including cats and ferrets, because they have a visual system that's very immature,

1193
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.000
so we were studying neuroplasticity, which is the brain's ability to change and response to experience.

1194
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.000
Really trying to define fundamental principles that do carry over to humans.

1195
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:51.000
And we were, I was also, there's a primary center at Davis, where it's doing work on non-human primates, and Macack monkeys.

1196
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:58.000
Big, dangerous monkeys that you wouldn't want to be left alone with, but I was working, trying to understand embryonic development, so working on feed on Macacks.

1197
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000
So, again, to do surgeries on feed on Macacks, and I loved working with my hand,

1198
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.000
I also discovered something in science, which is sitting and learning from books is great,

1199
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.000
but I have a lot of energy, and I need to put that someplace, and doing careful

1200
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:17.000
dissections for hours and hours was a great way to, I learned how to take all that energy that normally would go into big movements,

1201
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000
and just channel it into total focus.

1202
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:26.000
I could spend eight hours down the microscope, just doing dissections and listening to music and doing dissections.

1203
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.000
In fact, I used to play this game where I tried to get as ramped up and alert as possible by listening to music and drinking coffee,

1204
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:34.000
and then just do my dissections as slowly as possible.

1205
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.000
And it's to all this crazy stuff.

1206
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:44.000
And in those years, I was still going to shows there was a place up in Sacramento, rough place,

1207
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.000
and I started going to see Roger Morene, the disasters play.

1208
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:54.000
And, you know, as you know, agnostic front, it's only fair to call it the great Roger Morene.

1209
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.000
I'd go to these shows where I was legitimately afraid.

1210
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
You know, I'm like, I'm like, I'm not, at that point, I'm, last thing I want to do is get into a fight.

1211
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I'm just legitimately afraid of what's going to happen.

1212
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
This was at a place called the Bord Walk, and there was a place up on Broadway, the Colonial Theatre,

1213
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
and they would do Mexican wrestling one night with the hands dipped in glass.

1214
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
And then they would do punk rock shows.

1215
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I got to see the transplants, which is to Marmstrom, Travis Barker, and bands like that play in a little tiny theater.

1216
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
And I thought, life is so good.

1217
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I'm working on my PhD, we're publishing papers, I still have arms in this world, although I didn't know any of the characters.

1218
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
And then eventually I graduated.

1219
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I got my PhD and went and did a post-doc at Stanford.

1220
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
And that was a problem.

1221
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I was back in the early location.

1222
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000
There's a thing in neuroscience called Condition Place, Preference, where something really good happens for you someplace.

1223
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
You really like it.

1224
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
And your body goes into a great state when you're there.

1225
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
There's also a condition place of version.

1226
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000
And here I am back in Palo Alto and thing cash.

1227
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
This was kind of a dark place for me.

1228
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Forget the well, trimmed lawns, and everything.

1229
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
This place is not, I'm starting to get depressed.

1230
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
So I moved to San Francisco.

1231
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And one day I got this idea, I thought, wait a second,

1232
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
thrashers right over the hill.

1233
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Why aren't I there?

1234
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000
So I have a friend that was at a sibling magazine to thrash her, which is Slap magazine.

1235
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
It's now closed up, but I got any mark lightly that I grew up with.

1236
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Now works for Apple.

1237
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Called up Mark and said, hey, you know what?

1238
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Can I do some work for you guys?

1239
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
You said, sure.

1240
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
So do you not take photos?

1241
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
And I said sure.

1242
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
That's not true, but I said, I know how to take a photo.

1243
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
So he said, well, you can always do music stuff.

1244
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:40.000
So I started going to shows and taking pictures and doing write-ups and traveling a little bit for that for some extra cash.

1245
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
What year is this?

1246
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
2005 to 2010.

1247
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
So there's some publications and thrashers.

1248
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
People can, you might be able to find the my own.

1249
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
So I covered Marraine, the disasters bouncing souls.

1250
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Love those guys.

1251
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000
I remember when Roger Marraine went to jail and I don't forget what year it was, but I remember going to.

1252
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
They would have like benefit shows to raise money.

1253
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I don't know.

1254
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Roger, I don't know what we were doing.

1255
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Well, the thing is down for the cause.

1256
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I would say that much.

1257
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Well, the thing about Roger is that it's really interesting.

1258
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
And I don't even know if he'd remember who I was.

1259
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I became friendly with, I think it was his base player Reese.

1260
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:19.000
He was for the disaster's great band by the way, I loved the band, like the Janey Hawksong and some of those are just amazing songs.

1261
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:27.000
And I remember you seem Marraine when I was a kid and his neck was like,

1262
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
you still have a bulldog mastiff a few years ago.

1263
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Costillars and Costillan never lifted weights, right?

1264
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
But Roger's neck is huge, right?

1265
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And this is a guy that probably didn't lift weights.

1266
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
It's just huge because he's just born that way.

1267
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
And you know, like you guys are big dudes.

1268
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
It's like there's certain people that you know, risk-surf thick, neck is big and all that.

1269
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
And I went like, Marraine and like, Marraine could sing happy birthday.

1270
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.000
And it would be like, you know, you know, his voice just comes from so deep inside his body.

1271
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.000
It's just a beautiful and amazing to see what he can do and the physicality of it.

1272
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000
And so I did a thing for thrash on Marraine, the disaster,

1273
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000
the transplants stuff, bouncing souls was going to show getting 500 to 1000 bucks per article,

1274
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
which at the time is a postdoc.

1275
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
You know, pretty good because life was expensive.

1276
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
And when you're a postdoc, you're agitated.

1277
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
You're not making much money at all.

1278
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
And this is because at this time you're also at Stanford, you said,

1279
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000
that's right.

1280
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Doing what?

1281
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:23.000
That's all.

1282
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
It's a postdoc.

1283
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:30.000
So when you finish your PhD, you typically you five years where it's just pure research before you go get a hopefully get a professorship.

1284
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
So I would go to show,

1285
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:39.000
stay up most of the night, then come back to Stanford, sleep under my bench, wake up and start doing experiments.

1286
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
And shower at the gym.

1287
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000
And so in this is the thing, you know, those old habits die hard.

1288
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000
You said a lot of those are, as you mentioned, a lot of those early years, the decision making and the habits.

1289
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I'm carryover.

1290
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
And fortunately, I was able to to move the, the good ones forward, the good habits that is.

1291
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
So when I was a PhD student, I thought, why pay rent?

1292
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
There's a building here with a shower.

1293
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
It was a cage wash shower for the monkeys, but they never knew it was good.

1294
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
So I was shower in there, or at the gym.

1295
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I'd brush my teeth in the sink and I'd sleep there.

1296
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I did that also as a postdoc.

1297
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
And I confess, even eventually what happened was I finished my postdoc.

1298
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I was hired as a, what they call pre tenure professor, assistant professor at UC San Diego.

1299
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I got a house because at the time when the house is down here,

1300
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
it was in normal heights and it was relatively inexpensive.

1301
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000
So when from no responsibility, no property, no nothing at a house, a bulldog, and a laboratory, my own.

1302
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
But I think this was at UC San Diego.

1303
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
UC San Diego, this is a B-2011.

1304
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000
And I thought, well, the commute from normal heights to UC San Diego is pretty far.

1305
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
So I'm going to just put a couch in my office.

1306
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
The dog was fine.

1307
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
There's a field outside where I can take him out.

1308
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
And so I would sleep in lab, I don't two nights a week.

1309
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.000
And then eventually, and I did well there, my lab, I'm proud to say,

1310
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
and the credit really goes to the people very hard working.

1311
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Published good papers had grants and my career really took off in neuroscience.

1312
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000
And then eventually I was recruited back to Stanford as a tenured professor,

1313
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
which is where I've been now for about seven years.

1314
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:14.000
And even then when I got back, I thought, well, why the housing in the Bay Area is crazy.

1315
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
I looked at Costello, my bulldog, I was like, how can we move back in the lab?

1316
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
So I stayed there until someone finally came along and said, this sends the wrong message.

1317
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Well, it actually sends the message that there should be better housing for faculty,

1318
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
but I saved some money that way so that was able to eventually buy a small home.

1319
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
So over the years, it's been consistently the same themes.

1320
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Work hard, train, keep out of any kind of mischief, which is easy to do now.

1321
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I value so many things in my life. I wouldn't want to do that.

1322
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:52.000
And then just trying to bring the spirit of skateboarding and punk rock music to the whole thing of science.

1323
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:59.000
And then the piece of that where it kind of wraps around is that a few years ago I decided I'd write a book,

1324
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.000
but then I decided I didn't want to write a book and so I started going on podcast, Joe and Varus and the others.

1325
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.000
And you know, there was this guy, Lex Friedman, of course, and he said, maybe should start a podcast.

1326
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:18.000
So I started the podcast and when I did it, I looked to a couple of communities. I thought, who can just put things together really well?

1327
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000
That really understand aesthetics and the DIY, you know, do it yourself, kind of,

1328
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:29.000
mantra and get it right. And so I looked to a guy named Rob Moore who produces the fight podcast with Teddy Atlas,

1329
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.000
and who comes from the world of PR, but also those a lot about the fight world.

1330
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
And I went to Mike playback, who's a famous skateboard photographer, to the pictures of Danny Way jumping the Great Wall China.

1331
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:46.000
And the Great Wall China, DC shoes, Nike skateboarding, and Mike just knows how to do the kind of photographs that I like,

1332
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000
which are black and white and very, you know, looked, there's a common theme.

1333
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000
And so that's the podcast. And you know, people always ask why do you always wear a black shirt?

1334
01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
And you know, I've been wearing a black shirt to work for 25 years.

1335
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000
This isn't a costume for the podcast. I've just always addressed this way, done it this way.

1336
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000
And the wonderful thing about social media is you get in touch with people like you. And I should say,

1337
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:16.000
for me, it's a real honor to be here because when that 20, 15, 15, 16,

1338
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I was living with my girlfriend at the time, we'd met in San Diego.

1339
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
My ex girlfriend now, but we're on good terms, I can tell this story.

1340
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:28.000
And there was a kind of weird, maybe, seal theme in our household, because the guy she'd been with before was a team guy.

1341
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Uh-oh.

1342
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Right.

1343
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
And so it was like, I'm back in high school again. You know, this guy's, I won't say who it is,

1344
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
but he seems like a really nice guy. But team guy, and she was doing CrossFit with a bunch of team guys.

1345
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
And so here I am like the doebies I exist.

1346
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000
I lived with, and do all that. But you know, our first, her first party or gathering where all these guys come around like,

1347
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
once again, I'm the smallest person in the room.

1348
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I'm a scientist. I'm used to being the biggest guy in the room.

1349
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Smaller's kind of real good guys as you all are.

1350
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
But what ended up happening was I was an avid Tim Ferriss podcast listener.

1351
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
And I remember looking at the picture and it was your,

1352
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
your grill looking at me. And I showed her and I said,

1353
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000
uh, I said, this guy, it was just on Tim Ferriss. And she goes,

1354
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
well, if you're going to draw a team guy, that's the guy you draw.

1355
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And I thought, well, there's a lot behind that statement.

1356
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Let's not, I'm not going to ask why.

1357
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Um, so in any case, uh, I love that podcast. And it was, you know, when I lived here in San Diego,

1358
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I was involved a little bit in fitness and martial arts at a real,

1359
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
superficial level. And you guys would come in and, um,

1360
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.000
you know, beat everybody up and, uh, and then go, go off laughing and smiling and

1361
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
leave the rest of us, mirror mortals to think about what just happened.

1362
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
And I'm just kidding. Basically what you guys would do,

1363
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
come in and take over bars.

1364
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Well, that's true. Um, and, uh,

1365
01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
and so I learned which bars not to drink at,

1366
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
not because I was going to get in any mischief with anybody.

1367
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I know, you know, but because, um, you know,

1368
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000
they're only, uh, some, how do I say this correctly?

1369
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.000
It's a, it's a, uh, resource allocation issue.

1370
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000
So anyway, I've been running my lab for a long time now.

1371
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
The podcast is a newer thing we've had about a year and a half.

1372
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000
But the themes of skateboarding punk rock music, they, they are not just part of it.

1373
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I think this will make sense to you guys as it, uh, they're, they're in me, right?

1374
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
That they're, they're wired into my nervous system.

1375
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
And I'm, uh, feel really honored that to be here and also that this skateboard community

1376
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000
has, uh, reimbraised me with open arms and in touch with a lot of those guys,

1377
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Tony Hawk, Danny Way, Mike Playback, and there's so many names and, and people.

1378
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Um, it's an amazing community because skateboarding and punk rock music.

1379
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I don't know about other things because that's only what I know.

1380
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:45.000
But odd, but really special communities because you can be nine years old and hanging out with

1381
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
people that are in the 30s.

1382
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
And so you can learn a lot for better or for worse.

1383
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000
But it's also a community that, especially more and more, is really starting to,

1384
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:59.000
they take care of each other in a way that I think is probably not present in other communities.

1385
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
It can be harsh too.

1386
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I mean, if you screw up, they're going to let everybody know.

1387
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
So maybe some parallels with the teams.

1388
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Yeah.

1389
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Uh, so that kind of brings us through your sort of educational system and what you've been learning

1390
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:22.000
and learning along the way and, um, I want to grab some of that knowledge, you know, of what you've learned about,

1391
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:28.000
you know, how to be better, how to be smarter, how to be stronger, how to be faster, how to be more healthy.

1392
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Um, because all those things are things that, you know,

1393
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I've been trying to do my whole life as well.

1394
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:41.000
And, uh, obviously not done it on an academic level, but really through trial and error.

1395
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And, and also being surrounded by a bunch of people that were always, you know,

1396
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I had that, had that same kind of mindset.

1397
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
We were very lucky in the SEAL teams.

1398
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000
We had guys that would go way down the rabbit hole on some random,

1399
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
form of exercise or some random diet or what, what, what, what, what, what,

1400
01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
some random thing that it would get spread.

1401
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:05.000
And, and then we, really, I would say around maybe 2005, 2006,

1402
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
we started really bringing in professionals.

1403
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Actually, it was earlier in that.

1404
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000
We'd always bring in professionals, but so we'd bring in professionals that were really good at their designated field.

1405
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
So I feel like I got very lucky with some of that as well.

1406
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000
But, um, obviously you're, you're a living experiment on this stuff,

1407
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
and then you have the academics to back it up.

1408
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
So let's talk about some of this stuff.

1409
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Um, and I've listened to a bunch of your stuff, like, you know,

1410
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000
and, and anyone that wants to go deep on this, trust me.

1411
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
You can go deep listening to your podcast.

1412
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I mean, you can go real deep.

1413
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Yeah, I always say if nothing else will cure in somebody,

1414
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
because, uh, you listen to it, you know, not out,

1415
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
but, um, yeah, we do go to detailed.

1416
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000
I've had the great fortune of working with some units in special operations,

1417
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
doing, uh, talking about physiology and using physiology.

1418
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Um, yeah, these are tools that over the years I've used,

1419
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000
but most of what we cover on the podcast and what we can talk about now,

1420
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
um, are things that come from other laboratories.

1421
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
This is one thing I truly enjoy is talking about my own work and research,

1422
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
but a lot of what has been wonderful for me is bringing on expert guests

1423
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
and connecting with people who are experts say in thermal regulation.

1424
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Something is, I mean, the ability to adjust one's temperature

1425
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
through some dedicated actions is the difference between being able to do more work

1426
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
or no more work physically and mentally.

1427
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000
We can talk about that.

1428
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
But in terms of things that really enhance performance,

1429
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000
we can talk about the, what I, there are two ways to think about biology.

1430
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
One are modulators and the others are mediators.

1431
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
So there are some things that you can do that will strongly modulate your ability

1432
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
to do lots of other things.

1433
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Let's just give an example.

1434
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
If I sleep to private echo for two days,

1435
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
his ability to focus is going to be diminished.

1436
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Relative to what it would be if he had slept well for, for two nights.

1437
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Why?

1438
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Well, sleep and it's various outputs,

1439
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
modulate attention, but it doesn't mediate attention.

1440
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000
You can't really use sleep in real time to enhance attention.

1441
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Okay.

1442
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
A fire alarm will modulate my attention, but it doesn't mediate it.

1443
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
So we can know modulators and mediers.

1444
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
The important thing to understand is that there are certain foundational behaviors,

1445
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
do's and don'ts that set the stage for you to be better everything.

1446
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
So a lot of times people will say, how can I lift more focus better,

1447
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
remember things better? It's like, well, let's think about the foundation of that.

1448
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And that's always going to come back to two elements,

1449
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
and that's sleep and what I call non-sleep-deep rest.

1450
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:42.000
So sleep is the fundamental practice or part of our 24-hour cycle,

1451
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
where if you don't get it on a consistent basis,

1452
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.000
you are downregulating your ability to do everything.

1453
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Metabolism is screwed up, immune system is screwed up, etc.

1454
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000
However, it is not the case if you get a one-night-spad sleep

1455
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
or that if you're not sleeping perfectly, that you can't perform well.

1456
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
But let's talk about sleep, because I think it's important.

1457
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000
The goal for most people, unless you're pulling vampires shifts on deployment

1458
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
or you're shift worker and thank you shift workers, we'll talk about shift work,

1459
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
you should try and get really good sleep 80% of the time,

1460
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
8% of the nights of your life.

1461
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
But that's the point of the day,

1462
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
but the point is that there are a couple things that you can do.

1463
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
First of all, every cell in your body has a circadian rhythm,

1464
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000
meaning every cell has a 24-hour circadian clock that's regulated by genes.

1465
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Think of your body as a bunch of millions of clocks

1466
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
and you will line those clocks to a single time.

1467
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
This is why when you travel overseas, your gut goes off,

1468
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
or it's more easily you get sick, or you're thinking isn't quite right.

1469
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
The clocks aren't in alignment. They're not in train, as we say.

1470
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Number one practice for everything, sleep, especially is trying to get some natural light

1471
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
in your eyes within an hour of waking up.

1472
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
If you wake up before the sun, turn on a bunch of bright lights,

1473
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
and then get sunlight in your eyes once it comes out.

1474
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.000
If there's dense cloud cover, there are still more photons, light energy coming through that cloud cover,

1475
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
then there are coming from artificial lights.

1476
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000
So try and get five to ten minutes without sunglasses outside in the morning,

1477
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000
once the sun is out, most days, if not all days.

1478
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
This has an outsized effect on a number of things.

1479
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
First of all, it modulates the timing of what's called the cortisol pulse.

1480
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Once every 24 hours, you're going to get a boost in cortisol,

1481
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
big spike in cortisol to healthy boost.

1482
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000
It sets your temperature rhythm in motion, sets your level of alertness,

1483
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
your level of focus and your mood.

1484
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
You want that cortisol pulse to happen as early in the day as once.

1485
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
What's triggering the cortisol pulse?

1486
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
The cortisol pulse is naturally in train by these genetic programs

1487
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
to happen once every 24 hours,

1488
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000
so anchor it to the period where you see bright light.

1489
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.000
A late shifted cortisol pulse, so imagine the kid that wakes up and spends the morning and bed

1490
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
or you're spending the morning bed in your texting or your indoors and you're typing on the computer,

1491
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
that's not enough light to accomplish what I'm talking about.

1492
01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Then you go outside around noon or one.

1493
01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
You're in what's called the circadian dead zone,

1494
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000
which is the timing which light arriving at the eyes can do certain things

1495
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
but it can't time this pulse.

1496
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
That means that cortisol pulse is going to come in the afternoon,

1497
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
which means that your temperature rhythm is going to be shifted late,

1498
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000
and that's actually a signature of depression and anxiety and difficulty falling asleep.

1499
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
These are from studies done by the Great Robert Sapolsky and David Spiegel,

1500
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
my call is at Stanford.

1501
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000
You want that increase in cortisol to happen early in the day.

1502
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Basically, you wake up because your temperature goes up.

1503
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Let me ask you this. I have a sense for you. What time do you wake up?

1504
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Generally between, well, between 415 and 430.

1505
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Okay, so for most people it's going to be a little bit later,

1506
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I think probably, but for you that means, so you're waking up

1507
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
if it's because of an alarm, it's because of an alarm.

1508
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
But if that's your natural wake up time now without an alarm,

1509
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000
that means that your temperature is starting to rise at that time.

1510
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
That's why you wake up.

1511
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
That temperature increase triggers that cortisol release.

1512
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Now, and that's why some people wake up right before they're alarm clock.

1513
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
It's this cortisol pulse. Okay?

1514
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.000
And two hours before that, so for you, approximately 230 in the morning,

1515
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
is what we call your temperature minimum.

1516
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
It's when your temperature is lowest that it's ever going to be in the 24 hour cycle.

1517
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:22.000
If you view light within the four hours after that temperature minimum,

1518
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.000
it will tend to wake you up and will keep you in train to the normal cycle.

1519
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000
However, if you were to wake up at 130 in the morning and see very right light,

1520
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
it would delay your circadian clock.

1521
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000
It would make it so that the next night you'd want to go to bed later and wake up later.

1522
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
And the way it does that is by changing your core body temperature.

1523
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
So the way it works is you wake up because of an increasing core body temperature.

1524
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
That increasing core body temperature triggers that increase in cortisol.

1525
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.000
And by viewing light at that time, you in train, you ensure that it happens at the same time the next day.

1526
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Wait, if I woke up at 2 o'clock in the morning and saw bright light, that would delay your clock.

1527
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:04.000
So when you wake up at 430 in the morning, it's because your clock is in your,

1528
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
the clock's of your body are in train to their match to this cortisol pulse.

1529
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
So viewing bright light in the morning anchors,

1530
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
when we say in train, it, it, it, it, it,

1531
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
through a circuit that involves cells in the eye and cells in the hypothalamus,

1532
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
which then talk to the rest of the cells of the body through a signal, a peptide that's released.

1533
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Make sure that the temperature starts rising, goes up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

1534
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.000
And some time around 2 or 3 in the afternoon, you're going to hit your temperature maximum.

1535
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:34.000
You might feel a little sleepy at that time, but that's actually the time in which you're,

1536
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000
your, your, your, all your systems are kind of revving at the, at the maximum capacity.

1537
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
And then it's going to start to drop and start to drop drop drop drop.

1538
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Now that drop in temperature eventually will be a full 1 to 3D degrees below.

1539
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000
What your temperature maximum and that's when you're going to get sleepy and fall asleep.

1540
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000
This is why it's important to keep the room cool at night to fall asleep.

1541
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Why keep the room cool? Well, you can always put warm blankets on and put your hand out

1542
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000
or your foot out because you actually dump heat through the palms of your hands and the palms of your feet.

1543
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
But if you're in a hot room, you'd have to have like an ice bath next to you to put your hand in.

1544
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000
That's not feasible.

1545
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I guess I, I live in a luxurious scenario.

1546
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.000
I can't imagine that there's like, what kind of person is in a situation where they don't see the sun?

1547
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Oh, so that's horrible.

1548
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Well, I, I, I, I, I, I might last being on a submarine.

1549
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.000
That's horrible being on a ship sometimes you get stuck down below decks.

1550
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
And I remember this is interesting.

1551
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I remember I would have like the urge to go out and go outside.

1552
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Like we would, we would, we would, you know, being a seal between on a ship.

1553
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
You don't actually have a job on the ship.

1554
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
You're just kind of riding the ship.

1555
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000
So you'd have this urge to go outside and we go outside and PT.

1556
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000
We go outside.

1557
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Believe it or not, we go outside and hacky sack.

1558
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
One of my, two great hacky sack.

1559
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
I, I guess.

1560
01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000
But not listening to fish.

1561
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.000
We weren't listening to fish, but I, I'm, I'm gonna tell you, we played so much hacky sack that I kind of hurt one of my knees.

1562
01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:10.000
It's got to get through.

1563
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
So we're, in, yeah, inward rotation of the head.

1564
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
But we wanted to be outside.

1565
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
I remember having a distinct urge to want to get outside.

1566
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.000
So it's really sad if people are in scenarios where they aren't seeing the sun for four hours upon wake up.

1567
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000
That's kind of crazy.

1568
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:31.000
And blue light has been demonized and we can talk about light later in the evening because you don't want to get too much bright light in your eyes later in the evening if you want to improve sleep.

1569
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:38.000
But it does not work as well or as quickly through a window or through a windshield or through sunglasses.

1570
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
I glasses and contacts are fine.

1571
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
If you think about what those do, they actually focus light to the retina.

1572
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
So that's why they're there.

1573
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
They'll help you.

1574
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Even if there's UV protection, many people are waking up and they're just spending time indoors and they're putting on sunglasses getting in their car and driving or there's cloud cover and they think there's no sun out.

1575
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
I don't mean that you actually have to stare at the sun.

1576
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Never stare at any light.

1577
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
So bright it's going to damage you.

1578
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Please don't.

1579
01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
And blink as necessary.

1580
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:05.000
But the indirect rays from the sun trigger these cells in the eyes called melanops and ganglion cells.

1581
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000
These ganglion cells, these are neurons.

1582
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
They send a signal to your hypothalamus.

1583
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.000
They also then the hypothalamus releases this peptide which is a wake up signal for your whole brain and body.

1584
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000
And sets a timer for the onset of melatonin release 16 hours.

1585
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Later, melatonin being the hormone that makes you sleepy and makes you want to go to sleep.

1586
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:27.000
So you can imagine what happens if you don't get that light until a few hours later everything shifted.

1587
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:33.000
And then you want to go to go to go to why you're wide awake at 1130 or 12 and everything's messed up.

1588
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:40.000
The other thing is that you can get bright light from electronic devices early in the day, but it's not enough.

1589
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
You need photons from sunlight.

1590
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Now if you live in Scandinavia and the depths of winter if you're up in like, you know, try a high mirror or all hooser something like, okay fine.

1591
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Don't buy it in expensive daytime simulator.

1592
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Get one of these LED light boxes for drawing.

1593
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
They're very inexpensive in comparison.

1594
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
You can find them on Amazon.

1595
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
I don't have a relationship to any of these brands, but they're easy to find 20 30 bucks.

1596
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
But that on your desk and just look at that thing for a few minutes in the morning.

1597
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Not as good, but better than being in the darkness.

1598
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Then when the sun's out, get outside.

1599
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Now this is a huge, huge effect for the following reason.

1600
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.000
The signal that arrives from the eyes to the hypothalamus also triggers the release of the neuromodulator dopamine.

1601
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
We hear about dopamine as a feel good molecule.

1602
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Dopamine dopamine, dopamine hits.

1603
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.000
But dopamine's main role in the brain and body is to drive motivation, craving and pursuit.

1604
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
It is not the molecule of pleasure.

1605
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
It is the molecule of drive.

1606
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
It is life force.

1607
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.000
And we'll talk later about how dopamine and testosterone have a close relationship.

1608
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Dopamine is actually the molecule from which adrenaline,

1609
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
epinephrine, is manufactured.

1610
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
And you may notice you said you we crave sun.

1611
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
It also does make you feel good.

1612
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Here's why if you think about seasonally breeding animals, let's think about the architect fox.

1613
01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Well, the architect fox in winter is white.

1614
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
But in the summertime has darker pelage.

1615
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:08.000
It actually there's a pathway going from sunlight to dopamine to melanin production in the skin and fur.

1616
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:13.000
So animals that transition from light color to dark color, that's all made by dopamine.

1617
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Guess what else happens?

1618
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000
The gonads grow.

1619
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.000
There are animals that I've worked on in the laboratory and that also in humans,

1620
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.000
it's now been shown in a beautiful study that people who get 20 to 30 minutes of light on their skin.

1621
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
This was a stunning Israel.

1622
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000
So they were an appropriate amount of clothing, but they're sleeveless, no hat, no sunglasses.

1623
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
They were told to go outside.

1624
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
20 to 30 minutes, three times a week, just in the sunshine.

1625
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Ideally, they were shorts also.

1626
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000
They measure testosterone and estrogen and men and women.

1627
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Significant increases in both and all the associated things of increased passion.

1628
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, that is what they measured in the study.

1629
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Why?

1630
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Well, it turns out that light to the eyes, but also light to the skin.

1631
01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
The skin is an endocrine organ.

1632
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
It's not just something to tattoo and hang earrings from and put clothing on.

1633
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
It actually, there's a pathway involving a molecule called P53 and the keratinocytes.

1634
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:07.000
So these skins cells that when sunlight, when UVB, ultraviolet blue light penetrates the skin

1635
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:12.000
because it can penetrate the skin superficially, triggers these keratinocytes to stimulate a pathway

1636
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
that releases dopamine in the brain and body.

1637
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.000
So you feel better when you're getting light in your eyes and on your skin, and you're increasing

1638
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
testosterone and epinephrine and dopamine increase.

1639
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
That's why you feel good in the summer months.

1640
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000
People in skin may be a know this.

1641
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000
This is kind of spring fever.

1642
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.000
In the winter months, you want to go through every bit of effort to double or triple the amount of time

1643
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
that you're spending outside in the morning.

1644
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
So instead of 10 minutes, make it 30 minutes.

1645
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000
You can read outside.

1646
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.000
You can do, you could even be on your phone, but we'll talk about why that might not be optimal.

1647
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.000
In addition to that, there's a study done out of China now, tens of thousands of subjects,

1648
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:49.000
looking at the incidence of myopia, near-sightedness in kids, but now this is also true in adults.

1649
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.000
When you look at things up close, the eyeball actually starts to elongate over time.

1650
01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:00.000
And the image then focuses in front of the neural part of the eye and things are blurry.

1651
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000
That's why they call it near-sighted.

1652
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
It's actually far-sighted.

1653
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000
It would be the image falls behind.

1654
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000
So it's just pure optics, it's falling in front.

1655
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Coming myopic.

1656
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Spending time outside and getting UVB exposure during the day can offset in some cases reverse myopia.

1657
01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
So all these kids are spending time indoors on screens and reading on books,

1658
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
but not getting any outdoor time.

1659
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Sirius Promen, now adults are doing this too.

1660
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:30.000
The pandemic was, there was also a pandemic of myopia and depression that was simply because people were indoors too much.

1661
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
So get that sunlight early on.

1662
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
They shut down the freaking beaches in the sandier.

1663
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
I mean, it was crazy.

1664
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Hey, I went to college, I was an English major and there was one semester.

1665
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000
I took five English classes, five English classes, it was a dumb move.

1666
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000
But whenever I'm trying to plot out my classes,

1667
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
I could go to Jiu-Jitsu for like three, four hours next.

1668
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:58.000
So anyways, I ended up taking five classes and so I was reading like on the weekends.

1669
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000
I would read like eight, ten hours a day.

1670
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000
And yeah, that's when I realized, oh, if you don't stop and take a break,

1671
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:13.000
you're like, I'd get done and walk outside and my vision would be blurry.

1672
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:19.000
And because I was just working at that close range for five, six, seven, eight hours horrible.

1673
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Yeah, you definitely want to get a horizon view every once in a while.

1674
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.000
When you look at a horizon, unless you're tracking something on the horizon,

1675
01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
you naturally go into panoramic vision.

1676
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.000
And this is a great way to learn how to do panoramic vision we were talking about before.

1677
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
In an environment like this where it's close quarters,

1678
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I can look at you and then I can dilate my gaze consciously.

1679
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
And you don't know, I'm doing it.

1680
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.000
As we talked about earlier, it comms the nervous system.

1681
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
The nice thing is it's also covert.

1682
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
You can be doing public speaking.

1683
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
You can be meeting somebody where you're starting to feel a little tense or whatever.

1684
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000
And you can dilate your gaze or you can learn to,

1685
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000
I think it's a great skill to be able to dilate and contract the aperture of vision.

1686
01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000
And a horizon will teach you kind of the feeling of having dilated vision.

1687
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000
And then you can kind of accomplish that without looking at a horizon.

1688
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
So yes, if you're looking at things up close,

1689
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
they say for about every 45 minutes of doing that,

1690
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
you want 20 minutes of long distance viewing.

1691
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.000
That's very hard for most people to get in this kind of work environment.

1692
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.000
So one thing that works really well to reset the eyes and the nervous system throughout the day is

1693
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
walks are great and jogs are great.

1694
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Why? Well, turns out that self-generated optic flow.

1695
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.000
So not a peloton, sorry, work, not a treadmill, sorry,

1696
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:36.000
but walking or running or cycling or something where visual images are going by you on all sides while you're in effort.

1697
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Some beautiful papers, now five papers showing that when we are in self-generated optic flow,

1698
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.000
the amygdala, sight in the brain that's commonly associated with fear,

1699
01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000
but it's mainly a sight of threat detection and anxiety,

1700
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
is the activity in the amygdala suppressed.

1701
01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:01.000
I think about this a lot when I read your book and hear stories from the teams of this notion of having a forward center of mass.

1702
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000
And how often harder it stays still, right?

1703
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
I know you guys don't have a retreat button,

1704
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000
but it's harder to stay still than it is sometimes to move forward.

1705
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
That forward movement can actually calm us.

1706
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:18.000
And so a lot of people there on the precipice of something scary or challenging will retreat or pause,

1707
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000
but forward movement actually suppresses the activity of the amygdala.

1708
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.000
This again has been shown in humans and non-human primates and in small animal models.

1709
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:31.000
And it makes really good sense because forward ambulation, forward movement,

1710
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:36.000
is incompatible with the fear response in many ways.

1711
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000
And so one of the big discoveries in our field of neuroscience last few years was

1712
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000
laboratories not exploring the topic of fear at all.

1713
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:48.000
They were actually looking at eye movements and motor movements found when they did brain wide imaging that they're

1714
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000
the sights in the brain that quiet down when animals are people are moving forward.

1715
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
And the fear centers shut down.

1716
01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:00.000
So if you find yourself afraid, this is, I imagine the kid who, I mean, handrails are always dangerous.

1717
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000
You can, you can end your, your family lineage with handrails.

1718
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.000
I've seen people do that.

1719
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000
I won't name names, so there's a guy we grew up with who unfortunately, you know,

1720
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
hopefully he successfully reproduced at some point,

1721
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
but he's seen some hard stacks on handrails.

1722
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000
It's not pretty.

1723
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
But it's always going to be harder to sit up there at the top of the ramp thinking about dropping in.

1724
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Stop dropping in.

1725
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Gotta go.

1726
01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
When I was a kid, Gary Hall, the guy mentioned earlier said, I'm going to,

1727
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
you put your tail down on the deck.

1728
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.000
I'm in the top of the ramp that is, I'm going to skate from one end of the deck to the other.

1729
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000
And if I come back the third time and you haven't dropped in, I'm pushing you in.

1730
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
And I saw a lot of kids get pushed in.

1731
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Now a dad did that to his kid on YouTube and I think was punished for child abuse.

1732
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000
So now days, the rules have changed, but back then you were dropping in because you didn't want to get pushed in.

1733
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
And then he gets, it's always easier to drop in than stand there and wait.

1734
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
What do I do?

1735
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
What do I do?

1736
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
And that's the suppression, the amygdala.

1737
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000
When you go into forward action, the fear centers of the brain shut down.

1738
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000
So this is like another little connect of the dots and echoes.

1739
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Because he's heard me talk about this a million times.

1740
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
It's like, hey, when you're waiting to do something, you're going to be more scared.

1741
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
You're going to build up.

1742
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000
You need to step forward.

1743
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
You need to start taking action.

1744
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Take an action is a way to overcome the feeling of hesitation in fear that you have in your body.

1745
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000
So now I have another physiological backup.

1746
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
To my instincts.

1747
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
That's good.

1748
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
So we got up in the morning.

1749
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
We got some light.

1750
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
This is interesting because I wake up early morning.

1751
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000
I work out.

1752
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:28.000
But I go for a run by the time I'm going for a run, the sun's out.

1753
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Perfect.

1754
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
I never, and the sun might not be fully out.

1755
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:36.000
It's going to ask like, does it need to be hitting my skin or can it be kind of below the horizon?

1756
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Are we good?

1757
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
On a cloud list day, it can be anywhere.

1758
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:45.000
On a day with more clouds, you probably want to try an orient toward where the sun might be and get out of the shade a little bit.

1759
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Just so you don't have to be out there for more than five ten minutes.

1760
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Okay.

1761
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
I'm going on, you know, half an hour, 45 minute run.

1762
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Great.

1763
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
So we got some light.

1764
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Yeah.

1765
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000
And by the way, interestingly, I don't, I wear sunglasses a lot.

1766
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000
And maybe that's bad.

1767
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000
I wear sunglasses.

1768
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Actually, almost all the time if I'm in the sun.

1769
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
But when I go for a run in the morning, I never wear sunglasses because it's wet and all the cello stuff.

1770
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:11.000
And you have a lot of sun here in San Diego. So you're getting a lot of photons all day long.

1771
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:17.000
So there are a couple things about your practice that are perfectly designed. One is you're, there are a few things.

1772
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Let's just, let's just make it really simple for people.

1773
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:25.000
The goal here is to increase body temperature in order to be awake and to decrease body temperature in order to be asleep.

1774
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000
If we stay with those themes, a lot of this will just fall into bins.

1775
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:36.000
So you wake up, getting sunlight in your eyes will enhance the or bright artificial lights and then sunlight.

1776
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000
If you're up before the sun comes out, turn on brighter artificial lights.

1777
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
If you want to be awake, right?

1778
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000
We'll enhance the cortisol pulse.

1779
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Cortisol is going to further increase body temperature, exercising will increase body temperature.

1780
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Somewhat paradoxically getting into a cold shower or cold water.

1781
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Everyone says, what must make you cold, right?

1782
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Well, if you stay in there a long time, you can't be hyperthermic, right?

1783
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:03.000
But let's remember the thermostat example. You have a little airing of rain called the medial pre-optic area.

1784
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.000
And if you make the surface of your body cold, guess what happens?

1785
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Corb body temperature goes up.

1786
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:14.000
So getting into, so if you're going to do ice baths or cold showers, you can do it.

1787
01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.000
I would say do them some time better than not at all.

1788
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
And then there's the whole thing relative to training we talked about.

1789
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
But early in the day would be better.

1790
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Okay.

1791
01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.000
So I get back from my wrong and I'm going in the ice perfect.

1792
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.000
So about five to seven minutes in the ice bath.

1793
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
That's a good long ice bath.

1794
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000
But you guys are weamed in cold water.

1795
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000
You guys, I swim with a guy from the team's, but pop-up does it.

1796
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000
And we sometimes with a, for me it was a long swim.

1797
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
One mile, no wet suit swim in the Pacific.

1798
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000
For me around the Santa Monica pier, and then run back.

1799
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000
For me, you know, I'm quaking like a alcoholic with delirium trements.

1800
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000
By the time I get to the coffee shop, we go in there.

1801
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Sometimes quaking like this and I'm convinced they think that we're all have delirium trements.

1802
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Yeah, that's a cold swim for me.

1803
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.000
And I don't do it very much anymore. I should do it more often.

1804
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
But what's interesting is he sees the water.

1805
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.000
You guys like you see the what and it's like you want to get in the thing.

1806
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
For me, there's a 10 minute break in period one.

1807
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Like, oh my god.

1808
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I don't know.

1809
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.000
And then you have the triathletes on the beach and their wet suits going.

1810
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Are you really going to go in without wet suits?

1811
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
And I was like, I didn't realize people going with wet suits.

1812
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
But I just go numb when I hit the water.

1813
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000
But I never crave it.

1814
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000
I always think, all right, I'm going to do this because here I am.

1815
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000
And like, if I don't go in, I'll feel bad about myself and that kind of thing.

1816
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
You're doing that serious negotiation.

1817
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Yeah, right.

1818
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Yeah, we all know how I will say.

1819
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.000
I think about like for my for my eyes bath in the morning.

1820
01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I've always think like, I feel so good when I get done that it's worth a little

1821
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
shock of when you get in.

1822
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.000
And actually you legitimately do get used to the.

1823
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000
The quote shock of getting in like if I go on a trip for a week.

1824
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.000
And I come back and whatever I am, there's no there's no ice which is pretty normal.

1825
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
There's not no ice baths around the world.

1826
01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:01.000
But when I come back that first day, maybe even the second day it's a little bit more of a little bit of a.

1827
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I'm having some freaking Andrew, human and conversation with myself.

1828
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no deliberation over hard work as a name.

1829
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
This is a, thank you.

1830
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000
I deserve it.

1831
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000
You're absolutely right.

1832
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Yeah, it does not but certainly, but the so well, I'm glad you mentioned the mood enhancing effects.

1833
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000
So there's a beautiful paper published in the European Journal of Physiology in the year 2000,

1834
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
which took people and had them sit.

1835
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000
They actually had them on lawn chairs in water of a pool.

1836
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
It was a great way to run an experiment.

1837
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I would say people ask about cold showers.

1838
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000
There are not a lot of experiments on cold showers because think about it's very hard to control.

1839
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Is everyone under the shower the same way?

1840
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
It's at a, you put someone up in water up to their neck.

1841
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.000
It is, you know, you're saying, so it's experimental rigor that drives that.

1842
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.000
But they had people get into reasonably cool water 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

1843
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
So it's not that cold, but they had them stand for an hour.

1844
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Or they've had people get into very cold water.

1845
01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000
So I think that 40 degrees for just 20 seconds.

1846
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Now here's what's really interesting.

1847
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000
That shock that you refer to is adrenaline, also called epinephrine.

1848
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:10.000
And it is released from the adrenals, obviously, but also from a site in the brain called locustscerulious,

1849
01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.000
a little area of the brain stem that then sprinklers the rest of the brain with epinephrine

1850
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
and wakes up the rest of the brain.

1851
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000
So that shock occurs in the brain and the body and actually the stuff in the body doesn't cross the blood brain bears.

1852
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
So you're a two-part system.

1853
01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000
We talk about this layer because when those two systems are aligned, it's beautiful.

1854
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
When those two systems are out of alignment, that's not good.

1855
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000
So you get into cold water, that's the shock.

1856
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.000
For the first 30 seconds for most people who are untrained,

1857
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:42.000
your forebrain, which is controlling decision-making, is basically suppressed in its activity and other areas are ramped up.

1858
01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000
So just knowing that.

1859
01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
So just knowing that.

1860
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Exactly.

1861
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Panic.

1862
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Just understand that passes.

1863
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Then what happens is when you get out of the cold, whether or not it's a longer period at 60 degrees or a short period,

1864
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.000
I would hate to hear that people are only doing 20 seconds.

1865
01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.000
But maybe a minute to three minutes at 45 degrees or something.

1866
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000
There's a long arc release of dopamine and epinephrine.

1867
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
That's what was shown in the study.

1868
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
In humans.

1869
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Because people always go, well, it's just in mice.

1870
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000
No.

1871
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000
In humans.

1872
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:15.000
And that long arc of dopamine leads to a near doubling or more of dopamine and epinephrine.

1873
01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.000
In my colleague on a Lemke's book called Dopamine Nation, she works on addiction runs our dual diagnosis.

1874
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Addiction clinic at Stanford.

1875
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:32.000
She talked about a patient of hers that basically helped himself get over cocaine addiction by doing cold baths because it was the only thing that would give him the kind of dopamine release that even slightly mimic

1876
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000
his cocaine addiction and allowed himself to wean himself off with a healthier behavior.

1877
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Now, I'm not saying it's the equivalent of a drug-like cocaine, but I am saying that it's a better decision than a drug-like cocaine for obvious reasons.

1878
01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.000
So that mood enhancing effect that you feel afterwards, it's real.

1879
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
It's based on a real neurochemical effect.

1880
01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:58.000
And that dopamine and epinephrine will combine with the temperature increase from cortisol plus light plus exercise.

1881
01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
All things that increase core body temperature.

1882
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Now you've got increased core body temperature.

1883
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
You created a dopamine release epinephrine.

1884
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000
You've created a summer month inside your body.

1885
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:14.000
In the, in, I don't care if you live in Minneapolis in the depths of winter or someplace even as cold as New Hampshire.

1886
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.000
You are, you are creating summer in your body by doing that.

1887
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Now, if you live in San Diego or Los Angeles or Arizona and it's the summer and you're staying indoors and you're on your phone and you're not doing any movement until the afternoon.

1888
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Which is fine to exercise in the afternoon.

1889
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I realize there's some important benefits of that.

1890
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.000
And you're laying in bed or you're just walking around the kitchen and putting on sunglasses and driving,

1891
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:45.000
and we're, guess what, you're creating a Colorado winter inside of your body despite the fact that the sun is out.

1892
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000
So if you're wondering why you're slightly depressed, your metabolism is lower.

1893
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.000
If your testosterone output is slightly lower than maybe like it to be, there could be other reasons too, of course.

1894
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
But again, we're talking about modulators.

1895
01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000
And not saying getting sun in your eyes is in the morning is going to make your testosterone perfect.

1896
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:08.000
What I'm saying is you're, you're setting an internal milieu through things that increase core body temperature dopamine, up in effort, etc.

1897
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000
And that should be done relatively early in the day.

1898
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Now, we could sort of skip to something about temperature just to benefit people, kind of book in the opposite end of the day,

1899
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000
as the evening comes around, oh, I'm sorry, you asked a question.

1900
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.000
I want to close the hatch on this about sun low in the sky.

1901
01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
You do not need to see the sun rise across the horizon.

1902
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:34.000
However, what we're, the cells in the eye that trigger all this, the so-called melanops and ganglinks cells,

1903
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.000
respond best to yellow blue contrast.

1904
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.000
The next time you see a sun rise or a sunset, you will see the yellow blue contrast I'm referring to.

1905
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.000
And what it's associated with is a low solar angle sunlight.

1906
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.000
So if the sun is directly overhead, that yellow blue contrast isn't there.

1907
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Take a picture with your phone and everyone will see what I'm talking about.

1908
01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000
So you don't have to see the sun rise or you're not getting up as early as jacco, that's fine.

1909
01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000
But around, let's say you get up at 830 and you're outside by nine and the sun is low in the sky.

1910
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
It's certainly not overhead.

1911
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.000
You're still getting that yellow blue contrast that triggers the optimal activity of these cells.

1912
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Ideally, you would also get some sunlight in your eyes in the afternoon,

1913
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.000
because it turns out you don't have one circadian clock, one master clocking brain.

1914
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
You have two oscillators.

1915
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
This gets a little bit tricky in the biophysics,

1916
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
you have a morning oscillator and an evening oscillator.

1917
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
For people who think about oscillators,

1918
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
you geeks out there.

1919
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Two oscillators can predict many more things.

1920
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000
It's not, it's one plus one equals eight in this case.

1921
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Having two oscillators allows you to do a number of computations in the brain,

1922
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
including timing the onset of sleep, metabolism, et cetera.

1923
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:39.000
So try and get some sunlight in your eyes in the evening as well.

1924
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Here's why.

1925
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Even though I said early in the day,

1926
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.000
you need sunlight and a lot of light to trigger these pathways.

1927
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Late in the day, retinal sensitivity goes up.

1928
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
So if you see bright light in the evening,

1929
01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:54.000
and you're viewing too many screens and too much bright light in the evening,

1930
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
it's very easy to wake your system up again.

1931
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
So you want to really dim the lights in the evening.

1932
01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
You don't necessarily have to wear blue blockers.

1933
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.000
In fact, if you're wearing blue blockers in the light is still too bright,

1934
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000
it won't make a difference.

1935
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Because it's broad spectrum light, we'll trigger these pathways.

1936
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.000
So dim the lights in the evening, lower the temperature in your home,

1937
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
or in the room that you sleep.

1938
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000
And evening would be, or afternoon would be a great time to,

1939
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
I don't know, getting a sauna, take a hot shower,

1940
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
take a hot bath, why?

1941
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Well, if you stay in a long, long time, of course, you'll heat up.

1942
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000
But again, if you heat up the external part of the body,

1943
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.000
your core body temperature will drop after you get out of that sauna,

1944
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
after you get out of that bath.

1945
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000
And when it comes to sauna, Dr. Rhonda Patrick's really the more proficient one here,

1946
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
but we've talked about this literature.

1947
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
There are a couple ways to use sauna.

1948
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Just mention in Hot Bads work also really well.

1949
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.000
The study is showing enormous increases in growth hormone.

1950
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
We're done the following way.

1951
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
They had people get into a hot sauna for 30 minutes,

1952
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
then get out for five minutes, 30 minutes, then five minutes out,

1953
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.000
30 minutes that five minutes out for a total of two hours in the sauna,

1954
01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
between 175 and 210 degrees.

1955
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000
So how often?

1956
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Once a week.

1957
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Okay.

1958
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.000
If they did it more often, the amount of growth hormone release went from a 16-fold increase,

1959
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.000
which is pretty mega down to a two or three-fold increase.

1960
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.000
First, got worse because you become heated-dapted.

1961
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000
And you can also become cold-adapted.

1962
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
So we could talk about cold and how to use cold,

1963
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000
but remember, the more comfortable you get with a stimulus,

1964
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
the less of an adaptation effect you're getting,

1965
01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
just like weights are running or anything else.

1966
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Now it is true that the more often that people did 20 minutes of sauna

1967
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000
at 174 to 210 degrees Fahrenheit,

1968
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000
I think that's 80 to 100 degrees Celsius, if I recall.

1969
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
The more often they did that,

1970
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000
two or three times a week turned out to be better than one,

1971
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:43.000
and five to seven times turned out to be better than two or three,

1972
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.000
for lowering all cause mortality and death to cardiovascular events.

1973
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
So we're talking about growth hormone release.

1974
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:51.000
You want to do it every once in a while for many hours with breaks in the middle.

1975
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.000
For improved overall health, getting blood flow,

1976
01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
you're talking doing it every night would be great.

1977
01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
So it depends on what your goal is.

1978
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000
The same thing with the water.

1979
01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.000
If you want to build resilience,

1980
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:04.000
we'll make the stimulus as terrible as possible.

1981
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000
And here's a easy way to do it.

1982
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
You're going to kind of poke fun at the tough guys on the internet,

1983
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000
who get into the ice bath and sit there really stoic.

1984
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000
We guess what? There's this thing called a thermal layer that builds up around you.

1985
01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
And we're sitting there really stoic.

1986
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
You're not making it as cold as you could be, guys and gals.

1987
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Sift your body around a little bit.

1988
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Now it's cold.

1989
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.000
To get those hands under, get those feet under and pedal those while keeping your mind calm.

1990
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000
It is considerably colder because you're breaking up that thermal layer.

1991
01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000
It sucks.

1992
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Hence the way it was on out there on Coronado.

1993
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.000
It sucks when you, because at my ice bath,

1994
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:41.000
I have the little jet, my nest little jet on the side.

1995
01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
It's ionizing the water or whatever.

1996
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.000
So it's shooting in and that side is super cold

1997
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
because it's flow and faster body.

1998
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
My other side I've got it perfectly still.

1999
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.000
I got a thermal layer just keeping me all toasty warm on that right side.

2000
01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Well, I would say, you know, it's fun to play with the ice bath

2001
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.000
because you can, what you're doing is you can play with your relationship to adrenaline.

2002
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000
So the way I think about ice baths and cold showers and things like that,

2003
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
I think it was a series of walls.

2004
01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
When you get into the shock that you describe,

2005
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
that's a pulse of adrenaline in your brain and body.

2006
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:15.000
But then, you know, you might ask yourself this question,

2007
01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
you know, if you can withstand something for a second,

2008
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.000
why not a minute and if a minute, why not three hours?

2009
01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Well, the reason is that adrenaline is released in pulse of tile fashion

2010
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000
and they, it compounds a one wave then another wave.

2011
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.000
So it's, you're building, it's like an upward spiral of adrenaline.

2012
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000
It's not one, then down to zero one.

2013
01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000
It's one down to 0.5 to 0.5.

2014
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
So it's building on itself in the brain and body.

2015
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000
And as it circulates, it gets more and more painful until you go numb.

2016
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000
And then it gets easier.

2017
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Yes, you know.

2018
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.000
So one thing to do is to just imagine and actually learn to sense the waves of adrenaline.

2019
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.000
So maybe the first wave is just getting in the damn thing.

2020
01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Maybe climbing, I think of that as one wall.

2021
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
You climbed over that wall, now you're in.

2022
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Then you could say, well, I'm going to go 30 seconds.

2023
01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.000
And then maybe at 20 seconds, you'll feel that wall.

2024
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000
You thought 30, but that wall comes climb that wall.

2025
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
What you'll start to notice is the walls actually

2026
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000
start getting further and further apart because adrenaline has this incredible

2027
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.000
anti-inflammatory numbing quality to it.

2028
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000
So the walls actually get lower as time goes on.

2029
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
But they start off very high.

2030
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.000
That's the way that I think about the ice bath and that maps to the way that

2031
01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
adrenaline physiology actually functions.

2032
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.000
So again, it's that first, those first steps of the hardest.

2033
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
I think about this when I wake up in the morning and I don't want to do something.

2034
01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:28.000
I often see your watch staring at me on my phone.

2035
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.000
I do.

2036
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
And I think, ah, like, this is a big wall.

2037
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000
And I think, okay, but the walls are going to be diminishing over time.

2038
01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.000
And even if it gets harder, adrenaline bolsters you in that way.

2039
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
It's a magical molecule.

2040
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:45.000
So toward evening heat is going to be beneficial.

2041
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:50.000
The other thing is dim the lights, obviously, because lights are serving as a wake-up signal.

2042
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:54.000
And then, you know, a lot of people have this problem that they go to sleep and then they wake up at three in the morning

2043
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
or two in the morning, they can't fall back asleep.

2044
01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:00.000
And so I said the two major modulators are sleep and non-sleep-deep-rest.

2045
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:05.000
And non-sleep-deep-rest or NSDR is a phrase that, to be direct.

2046
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:11.000
I coined to encompass a lot of behaviors that are designed to just teach you to lower your level of activation

2047
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
in your nervous system.

2048
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Meditation is one form, but the problem with meditation is meditation involves focus.

2049
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000
You have to pay attention to your breath, for instance, sit there and meditate.

2050
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.000
That actually puts a high demand on the metabolic systems of the front

2051
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
and metabolic systems of the forebrain.

2052
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000
So it's work.

2053
01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000
It's like reading.

2054
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Except you're reading your breaths and your thoughts.

2055
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Non-sleep-deep-rest includes things like, as a kind of corny name for some, it's called Yoganejra, which means Yoganejra, which means Yoganejra, sleep you lie down.

2056
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.000
You just listen to a script.

2057
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000
You can find these on YouTube or elsewhere.

2058
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
10-minute ones or 30-minute ones.

2059
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Take you through a body scan, some long exhale breathing.

2060
01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Talk about why this comes to body.

2061
01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Or there are various forms of hypnosis that really involve teaching you to relax.

2062
01:45:51.000 --> 01:46:00.000
So non-sleep-deep-rest is kind of a general term for things that we deliberately do to teach our body to downregulate in real time.

2063
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:05.000
And so I highly recommend that if people have trouble falling back asleep in the middle of the night,

2064
01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:12.000
that they turn on a Yoganejra and listen to that, or they use an app like Revery, which I think they have a free trial on there.

2065
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Is there a Yoganejra English speaking or is it a chant or what's the Yoganejra going on?

2066
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
It means Yoganejra sleep.

2067
01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
It's existed for thousands of years.

2068
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000
How's you lie down?

2069
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
The scripts are in English.

2070
01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
The ones that you'll find on YouTube.

2071
01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
There's actually an NSDR script.

2072
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Put out by a team guy in his company made for.

2073
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
These are again zero-cost tools.

2074
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
You can just listen to them.

2075
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.000
It takes you through a body scan, a lot of long exhale breathing.

2076
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:44.000
The reason he put that out there and the reason why I talk about NSDR is that when people hear Yoganejra or the hear meditation,

2077
01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.000
they think, you know, flying carpets, monks and lotus position.

2078
01:46:47.000 --> 01:47:01.000
And one of the problems with science and with some of the better practices from different communities in Asian and Indian communities is that a lot of it's vaulted behind language.

2079
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
You know, science is guilty of this too.

2080
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
You start talking about adrenaline and locusts serrulious.

2081
01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:08.000
And if you don't put it in context, you're like, ah, yeah, that doesn't mean anything to me.

2082
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Yoganejra sounds like something very foreign.

2083
01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:15.000
At the end of the day, non-sleep deep rest practices are all about the same thing.

2084
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
We have a system in our body called the autonomic nervous system.

2085
01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:24.000
This is the system that when bomb blasts goes off or you hear loud noise, immediately put adrenaline in your body.

2086
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
The most amazing molecule, right?

2087
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.000
I mean, if you think about it, you didn't need sleep, you didn't need a nap, you didn't need caffeine.

2088
01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:33.000
All of a sudden you are alert, you're done, you're there, rather.

2089
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:38.000
And that's the so-called sympathetic nervous system getting activated.

2090
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Broad system goes out, it's called Sympa Casympa means together.

2091
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:47.000
And you have a chain of neurons called the sympathetic chain gangly that run from your belly button up to about your heart.

2092
01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:55.000
When some external stimulus or some thought triggers the sympathetic nervous system, all those cells fire up at once.

2093
01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.000
They just pulse of adrenaline into your body or they trigger the pathways to those.

2094
01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:07.000
So when you're driving and you almost get an accident and you feel the adrenaline reaching out to your fingers, that's your feel of confidence.

2095
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.000
That's what that's happening.

2096
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:15.000
It's really emanates from the center and what's interesting is in fish and in other animals, all mammals of all kinds, but also in fish.

2097
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:22.000
It actually triggers the muscles of the thoracic muscles and the motor neurons there to start

2098
01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
undulating to know which direction to go.

2099
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Animals that get into a threat mode often have an undulation to them.

2100
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:35.000
That's the sympathetic nervous system, you know, a body and motion is more available for movement in any trajectory, as opposed to being completely still.

2101
01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Etc. So then you have another system, which is the parasympathetic nervous system.

2102
01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:46.000
It's like the other end of the seesaw and it's neurons that exist from the neck down to about the heart and from the belly button down to the bottom of your tailbone.

2103
01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Those are the ones that's so called rest and digest system, but it's much more than that.

2104
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:55.000
It's also the system that allows you to dial out your gaze reflexively.

2105
01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:03.000
You can learn how to do that under states of high adrenaline if you like, but naturally when you're relaxed, your gaze dilates.

2106
01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Reproduction is kind of a balance between the two.

2107
01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:14.000
The process of reproducing the verb, literally of sex, not the biological sex, but the verb sex is a process of the autonomic seesaw.

2108
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:18.000
There's a rousal, which involves a kind of balance in these systems, etc.

2109
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Kids look it up, not too young, appropriately aged kids look it up, but it's inherent to the evolution of our species is a balance between activation and calm.

2110
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:35.000
And so when we are born, we have an asymmetry in this autonomic nervous system.

2111
01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
That asymmetry is the following.

2112
01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:40.000
None of us need to learn how to stress or react.

2113
01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:50.000
That system, the activation of the sympathetic nervous system is automatic and response to different thoughts and stimuli cold, for instance, being the universal trigger of adrenaline.

2114
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Why not use heat?

2115
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Well, you can only use so much heat before you damage tissues or kill people.

2116
01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.000
You can use a lot of cold as they know on coronado.

2117
01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:04.000
You can use cold a lot before you have to be careful, but you have to get pretty damn cold for a long time before you die.

2118
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
But do be careful with this stuff, obviously.

2119
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Now, the parasympathetic system is different.

2120
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.000
We rarely learn how to calm ourselves.

2121
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
We all are familiar with getting sleepy and falling asleep.

2122
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.000
That's the parasympathetic nervous system taking over.

2123
01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000
The longer we are awake, the longer the buildup of something called a denacene in the brain and body,

2124
01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:25.000
and a denacene turns on the parasympathetic nervous system, suppresses the sympathetic nervous system.

2125
01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.000
When we sleep, a denacene is pushed back down.

2126
01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
What is caffeine?

2127
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Caffeine effectively through some chemical steps blocks the effects of a denacene.

2128
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:43.000
So if you wait, so here's a little trick if you, that's, I don't like the word hacks because hacks imply using something for a purpose it wasn't designed for.

2129
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Here we're talking about hard-wired biology.

2130
01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:51.000
But if you wake up in the morning and you didn't sleep quite as much as you would have liked, that means, and you're sleepy,

2131
01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000
that means you still have a buildup of a denacene in your system.

2132
01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Let's say you immediately reach for caffeine.

2133
01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Great.

2134
01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.000
You suppress the action of that adenosine and you will be more alert.

2135
01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.000
And guess what happens?

2136
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Then the caffeine wears off and the adenosine binds to the receptors with greater affinity and you have your afternoon crash.

2137
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:13.000
So a practice that's very useful to people is to delay the intake of caffeine by 60 to 90 minutes after waking.

2138
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Allow the adenosine to be cleared out because it's not just cleared out in sleep.

2139
01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.000
It's also cleared out in those kind of sleepy states of early morning.

2140
01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000
So allow it to be cleared out.

2141
01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
The other thing that clears it out, exercise.

2142
01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
So when you get up in the morning you're kind of sleepy.

2143
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000
I don't want to do this.

2144
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
I don't want to do this, but you hydrate and train.

2145
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
You clear out the adenosine.

2146
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Now I like to drink caffeine before I train or during training.

2147
01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
I'm weak like that.

2148
01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.000
But for people to have an afternoon crash,

2149
01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.000
this can have tremendous benefits of.

2150
01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:45.000
And maybe start by pushing it out 15 minutes per day.

2151
01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Most of everyone that does this says, oh my goodness,

2152
01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.000
I didn't understand why in the afternoon I'm crashing so hard.

2153
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
This will really, really help.

2154
01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000
I've been curious to you drink coffee before you train.

2155
01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
No, so that's for weak people.

2156
01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000
I don't like the taste of coffee,

2157
01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
but I also don't drink any caffeine.

2158
01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
I drink one of my go drinks or anything like that.

2159
01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.000
And I drink water in the morning and I go workout.

2160
01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000
And I've thought about it.

2161
01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000
I thought, and this, I thought about it.

2162
01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000
I always thought well.

2163
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Honestly, I thought it seemed kind of weak to like after you do that.

2164
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
I didn't do that, right?

2165
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
So I didn't do it.

2166
01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
But there has been time from thinking man.

2167
01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Like I'll see, you know, look at other people and they'll be like drinking coffee.

2168
01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Is it working out first thing in the morning?

2169
01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
And I'm thinking, you know, maybe I should do it.

2170
01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
You know, maybe I am wrong.

2171
01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.000
I know.

2172
01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
I'm hoping to being totally wrong.

2173
01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Well, here's the thing.

2174
01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000
If adrenaline is the most incredible molecule in biology,

2175
01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.000
and I do believe it is for its capacity to immediately grab our

2176
01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:49.000
attentional systems and our readiness systems.

2177
01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Dopamine is perhaps the second place winner there, but still a significant one.

2178
01:52:54.000 --> 01:53:00.000
You know, there's this incredible experiment that's been done in animals and humans that really illustrates what dopamine does.

2179
01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Take two rats.

2180
01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
They've done this with people in naturally occurring situations.

2181
01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.000
And you put rats next to some delicious water.

2182
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Like they like water with sucrose in it or a delicious food.

2183
01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:14.000
And the rats will reach up and drink that or eat that.

2184
01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Food.

2185
01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:20.000
One of the rats it turns out doesn't even have neurons that make dopamine or all their dopamine is blocked by the injection of a drug.

2186
01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Turns out they will indulge in that food just fine.

2187
01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Just like the one that has plenty of dopamine.

2188
01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:28.000
So just to make sure I'm tracking two rats.

2189
01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Yeah, every kid has their dopamine has been blocked.

2190
01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Correct.

2191
01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:37.000
But at this point, they're both just eating the sugary drinking the sugary water.

2192
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Just everything's fine.

2193
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Yep.

2194
01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Tase good and the experience pleasure.

2195
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Both of them experience pleasure.

2196
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Proof that dopamine is not required to experience pleasure.

2197
01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Now you do a simple experiment.

2198
01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.000
You simply move the location of the food or water.

2199
01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.000
One rat length away from the rat.

2200
01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
And guess what?

2201
01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.000
The rat with its dopamine walks over and eats the food.

2202
01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.000
It might even cross a little metal plate where it gets an electrical shock.

2203
01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.000
But you know, it's hungry and it wants to eat so it'll take the zap and do it.

2204
01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000
The rat without dopamine won't even be able to eat it.

2205
01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
But what does it mean?

2206
01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Won't even walk one rat slain to get its dopamine even if the food is laid out on the floor for it.

2207
01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Dopamine is not the molecule of pleasure.

2208
01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:26.000
It is the molecule of motivation, desire and pursuit.

2209
01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000
See, this is interesting.

2210
01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
We had an experiment that we talked about on here.

2211
01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
I had a back in the day.

2212
01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.000
I had an RV.

2213
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:38.000
And for whatever reason, I had taken the mint chocolate chip ice cream and put it in the RV freezer

2214
01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000
for some reason.

2215
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.000
I forget why.

2216
01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:44.000
And you know, when that, when that stuff's in the freezer in the house, it was like,

2217
01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Oh, cool.

2218
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.000
I'm going to get it right there.

2219
01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.000
We're going to go get it, right?

2220
01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.000
But I guess I wasn't dopamine fueled enough.

2221
01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Like three, four, five days went by before I was like,

2222
01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000
I really want it.

2223
01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
So I'm going to go get it.

2224
01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Well, it's, it is the molecule of drive.

2225
01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:05.000
The way to think about dopamine is that it is a non-infinite yet renewable resource.

2226
01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Non-infinite yet renewable.

2227
01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
What do I mean by that?

2228
01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Well, this relates to the energy drink caffeine question.

2229
01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Should you be doing all this stuff?

2230
01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Just as adrenaline, epinephrine is released in response to psychological stressors,

2231
01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:23.000
physical stressors, cold water, final exams, you know, broken relationship,

2232
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.000
excitement.

2233
01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
These are generic molecules.

2234
01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Right?

2235
01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
I mean, they're used to create activation states in the body.

2236
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Dopamine is the molecule of motivation, pursuit, and desire.

2237
01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:37.000
And it can be triggered by a number of different things.

2238
01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:42.000
However, it is a non-infinite yet renewable resource.

2239
01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:47.000
So if you have two big dopamine release,

2240
01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.000
let's say from methamphetamine cocaine,

2241
01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
I'm going to go in there if I go in there.

2242
01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Or let's say, let's be fair, because I, you know,

2243
01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:02.000
know people, or from being in a lot of gun fights in a short period of time.

2244
01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
The period immediately after that,

2245
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:07.000
will involve a mirror symmetric decrease in dopamine.

2246
01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
You don't go back down to baseline.

2247
01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
You go below baseline.

2248
01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:16.000
So we all should guard our dopamine peaks very carefully.

2249
01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
A little bit goes a long way.

2250
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.000
A lot goes even further, but it also takes you down deeper afterwards.

2251
01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
This is the basis of addiction.

2252
01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:27.000
And this is the beautiful work of on a Lemke and Rob Alenka,

2253
01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Stanford and elsewhere, showing that when it goes down,

2254
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
do we want it back right now?

2255
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Ah, so the dip afterwards is actually associated with a molecule called

2256
01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Dynorphin, which is the opposite of endorphin,

2257
01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.000
and involves pain in the body.

2258
01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:48.000
So for every bit of pleasure that we get from pursuit and getting the thing that we were pursuing,

2259
01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.000
the crash that comes afterwards feels painful.

2260
01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.000
And all that we need to do in order to return to a baseline of dopamine,

2261
01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:01.000
renew that resource, is to wait and make sure that we don't try and trigger

2262
01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
more dopamine in that time.

2263
01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:08.000
So you asked about should I be taking caffeine and addition to training and blasting music?

2264
01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:13.000
I always say people differ on this spectrum, but be careful about stacking dopamine.

2265
01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Training itself is a stimulus for dopamine release.

2266
01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Cold water is a stimulus for dopamine release.

2267
01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:22.000
But if you start doing training, cold water,

2268
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
listening to your favorite music,

2269
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000
plus you're taking, let's say, some stimulant.

2270
01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Doesn't obviously, the stimulants we've been talking about are terrible,

2271
01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:33.000
but some of the stronger stimulants out there,

2272
01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:36.000
used to be a fedron in blackenons and college.

2273
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.000
But now people taking lateral, is that real?

2274
01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Now we leave it right now we leave it.

2275
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Yeah, I had a guy work with him, fortunately he died,

2276
01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:50.000
but you would see, like he was in my cartoon, you would see.

2277
01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:54.000
He would take that, he called it rip-y rip.

2278
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Well, it's got an irreducerity.

2279
01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Actually, you can tell if somebody has a lot of dopamine in adrenaline

2280
01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
and they're just by looking at them, their pupils are big.

2281
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:04.000
So somewhat paradoxically, when pupils are big,

2282
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:07.000
your visual aperture is narrow, that just has to do with the,

2283
01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
with the, so called a combination of the eye, the optics of the eye.

2284
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:13.000
So remember, big pupils means somebody is high on their own dopamine

2285
01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.000
and adrenaline.

2286
01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Could be drug induced, could be situational, et cetera.

2287
01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Small pupils are going to be the relaxed state.

2288
01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Now of course, it's also going to be modulate

2289
01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:24.000
by how bright it is in an environment because of the way these systems work.

2290
01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:27.000
But when you can see somebody wide-eyed,

2291
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
well, dopamine and adrenaline also do something else.

2292
01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:32.000
They actually trigger activation of the brainstem cranial nuclei

2293
01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
that cause opening of the eyelids.

2294
01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:37.000
They also cause an eyes-up effect when we get sleepy,

2295
01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
what happens are eyes go down.

2296
01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:42.000
When we're awake, eyelids are open and eyes are up.

2297
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
They might not be up like this.

2298
01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
These are relate to three different cranial nerve nuclei

2299
01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.000
for the future med students you'll learn what these are.

2300
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.000
So it all makes perfect sense when, when, because nature is beautiful

2301
01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
and the biology is laid out for us.

2302
01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:59.000
But if we start stacking behaviors plus form ecology,

2303
01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:02.000
plus mind sets that increase dopamine, great.

2304
01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:06.000
But what that means is that if you get a really big dopamine increase,

2305
01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:10.000
well, then that afternoon you might not feel the drive to do the work.

2306
01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.000
You might think, how am I sleeping in the after, why am I kind of less motivated?

2307
01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Or next day for training without that form ecology?

2308
01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.000
You're thinking, oh yeah, the workout isn't, I don't get it.

2309
01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Why does intense attraction of muscle?

2310
01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000
I'm on a train.

2311
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:25.000
I'm not going to train that.

2312
01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Exactly.

2313
01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.000
You said it to that.

2314
01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.000
That's how you taught the hype chain.

2315
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Well, I'm just thinking about it because a lot of times people ask me,

2316
01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:34.000
oh, if I have a hard time, you know, like, I get fired up to do stuff

2317
01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.000
but then I don't actually do it.

2318
01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:38.000
You know, that's a common sort of thing for humans.

2319
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
And now I can kind of track it a little bit.

2320
01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Oh, you got yourself super worked up.

2321
01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:46.000
And then you let that go or you, you know,

2322
01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
maybe you worked for a little bit of time, you know, like,

2323
01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:52.000
hey, writing a book, writing a bunch of books.

2324
01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:55.000
You're not like hyped to write the book.

2325
01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
You're like, oh man, it's going to be,

2326
01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:00.000
and you, that only lasts for seven minutes of typing, bro.

2327
02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:01.000
That's it.

2328
02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.000
It's chopwood.

2329
02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Yeah.

2330
02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Yeah.

2331
02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
And then it's like, oh, this is just going to suck.

2332
02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:06.000
And that's just the way it is.

2333
02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:09.000
But now I realize if you, this is what I like about this.

2334
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:14.000
If you're aware of the fact that, oh, this is my dopamine crash

2335
02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:18.000
and I can't, I shouldn't anticipate continue hype

2336
02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.000
through this situation.

2337
02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
I need to push through it.

2338
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
That's, that's good awareness to have.

2339
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Definitely.

2340
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
And, you know, nowadays you hear, especially in cell comb,

2341
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
but dopamine fasting, you know, the people,

2342
02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
I don't even want to look at somebody else's face.

2343
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
I'm not going to eat any, you know, tasty food.

2344
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
I'm not going to do anything that stimulates dopamine.

2345
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Sure.

2346
02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
That will reset what you find pleasurable.

2347
02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.000
But let's be realistic.

2348
02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:41.000
The better way to do things would be to modulate dopamine release.

2349
02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Control it.

2350
02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
But make it work for you.

2351
02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000
And everyone's going to differ.

2352
02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
So for some people, it's got to be music.

2353
02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.000
The pre-workout.

2354
02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:51.000
The, you know, four cups of espresso.

2355
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
And, you know, and someone's screaming in their face.

2356
02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.000
That they have to do it.

2357
02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Well, for other people, we're required, we're required

2358
02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
a few of those variables.

2359
02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:02.000
But everyone needs to learn how they feel both before

2360
02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.000
during and after a behavior.

2361
02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
You know, I think the right amount of exercises

2362
02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
what you can do consistently in train hard,

2363
02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
but that also allow you to perform, unless you're an athlete.

2364
02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.000
And that's your profession to be able to do the other things

2365
02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
throughout the day that are beneficial to you.

2366
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
And of course, some people are training late in the day.

2367
02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.000
And I have no problem with that.

2368
02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:24.000
I got kind of attacked by the fitness and these

2369
02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
does recently or whatever you call them online.

2370
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Because I said, you know, training early in the day,

2371
02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.000
such as the dopamine pulse.

2372
02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Like, training late in the day has been shown in these

2373
02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:32.000
19 studies.

2374
02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Sure.

2375
02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
I've been sure for when your body temperature is elevated

2376
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:38.000
later in the day, you know, lubrication of the joints

2377
02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.000
and you know, mental acuity.

2378
02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Sure.

2379
02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.000
But for most people who just need to get more movement

2380
02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
and are trying to maximize focus on productivity

2381
02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
throughout the day, early day training is going to be

2382
02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
probably the better option.

2383
02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
But sometimes it's better than no time.

2384
02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.000
But if you're training late in the day,

2385
02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
and you're getting a big increase in body temperature,

2386
02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
and you're doing it under bright lights,

2387
02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:57.000
and you're drinking a pre-workout,

2388
02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
and you're wondering why you can't sleep at night,

2389
02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
you know, you don't have to be sigmin' Freud

2390
02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
or a neuroscientist to understand that you're basically just

2391
02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.000
have your body cranking your body temperature up.

2392
02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Hence a lot of these technologies,

2393
02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
and here this isn't a promotion.

2394
02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
At least not now, don't have a relationship to any of them.

2395
02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:12.000
I won't even name them.

2396
02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:13.000
There are a lot of technologies now about

2397
02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:14.000
making your bed cool.

2398
02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
This matter, that this, you know,

2399
02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.000
to cool down your body temperature at night,

2400
02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.000
so you can sleep.

2401
02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
So if you start thinking about this thing,

2402
02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
I have a ration and structure, it makes sense.

2403
02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
It also makes sense why, for instance,

2404
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:27.000
after a big win,

2405
02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
sometimes we feel a crash.

2406
02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
And we need some time to reset,

2407
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
and that lower depression,

2408
02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
sometimes people make the mistake of going out

2409
02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
and pursuing more dopamine.

2410
02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:40.000
One of the areas that I have real concern about

2411
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.000
just because I hear about it so often,

2412
02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
and it wasn't an issue when I was growing up,

2413
02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
is a lot of young guys in particular approach

2414
02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:48.000
to me because they're based on the questions I'm getting.

2415
02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:51.000
They're watching a lot of really intense pornography.

2416
02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
And that has, we know,

2417
02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
their studies now going on at Stanford and elsewhere.

2418
02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.000
You know, pornography,

2419
02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
creates a strong dopamine rush.

2420
02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
These are very primitive pathways

2421
02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:04.000
that in some ways can overwhelm the dopamine system.

2422
02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.000
And then, you know,

2423
02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
another thing is happening,

2424
02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
a lot of young guys are getting all this arousal

2425
02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
from watching other people have sex.

2426
02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
And then they're in the real world scenario,

2427
02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:14.000
and it's like, wait,

2428
02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:15.000
you're no longer third personning,

2429
02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
you're actually in this scene.

2430
02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
And it's completely collapsing them.

2431
02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
And so I'm not one of these anti-porn people.

2432
02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
I'm not here to judge,

2433
02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:24.000
I'm just assigned to some reporting.

2434
02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.000
I always say,

2435
02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:26.000
I'm not doctor,

2436
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000
I don't prescribe things,

2437
02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.000
I'm a professor,

2438
02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.000
so I profess things.

2439
02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
You can decide what you want to do with it or not.

2440
02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
But if you once you understand dopamine,

2441
02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:34.000
that all makes perfect sense.

2442
02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
They're getting this enormous dopamine release

2443
02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:39.000
from something that is external to them.

2444
02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.000
And real life,

2445
02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:41.000
you know,

2446
02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:45.000
may not mimic the intensity of the combination of variables, right?

2447
02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Or people are exercising for a little while

2448
02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
and it's all exciting to them and they're,

2449
02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:52.000
you know, taking tons and tons of pharmacology to do it.

2450
02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
And then they're kind of lose motivation.

2451
02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Well,

2452
02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:55.000
it remembered,

2453
02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
non-infinite yet renewable resource.

2454
02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Yeah,

2455
02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:01.000
that's being aware of these things.

2456
02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
I think is so important

2457
02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
because, you know,

2458
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
if I said,

2459
02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:07.000
hey,

2460
02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
you're going to walk through my house

2461
02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
and I'm going to scare you.

2462
02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
I'm going to jump out and scare you at some point.

2463
02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
I probably wouldn't be able to do it.

2464
02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Because you'd be aware of waiting

2465
02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.000
and I'd jump out and go boo,

2466
02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000
and you'd be like,

2467
02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:18.000
oh yeah,

2468
02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
whenever I be able to do it.

2469
02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
But imagine if I didn't tell you.

2470
02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000
Right.

2471
02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:23.000
And I said,

2472
02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:23.000
yeah,

2473
02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:24.000
I come by my house and,

2474
02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:24.000
you know,

2475
02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:25.000
just let yourself in,

2476
02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:26.000
I'll be there in a little while,

2477
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
then I freaking jump out and scare you.

2478
02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.000
You'd be scared.

2479
02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Because you're not aware of it.

2480
02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:31.000
You're not aware of what's going to happen.

2481
02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.000
So having awareness,

2482
02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
I remember how to fight her,

2483
02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:37.000
who had been highly competitive wrestler,

2484
02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:41.000
and he was going to fight in a big organization.

2485
02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
And he was sort of like,

2486
02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:44.000
I was like,

2487
02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.000
hey, are you feeling nervous at all?

2488
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000
This was a couple weeks prior.

2489
02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Hey, you feel nervous?

2490
02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
He's kind of blown me off a little bit.

2491
02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:50.000
You know,

2492
02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.000
hey,

2493
02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:52.000
I've been fighting for,

2494
02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
I've been wrestling for my whole life.

2495
02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:55.000
I've been competing.

2496
02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:56.000
I've been on the national stage,

2497
02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:57.000
blah, blah, blah, blah,

2498
02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:57.000
right?

2499
02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:58.000
I'm not nervous.

2500
02:04:58.000 --> 02:04:59.000
I said,

2501
02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:00.000
okay, great.

2502
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.000
I should have known better.

2503
02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Because when he went and fought,

2504
02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.000
now he's in the UFC,

2505
02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
and he got nervous.

2506
02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
And what really I think messed him up

2507
02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
was he didn't understand what was happening.

2508
02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:13.000
And then I remembered I used to talk to like a new guy

2509
02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
that was showing up on deployment.

2510
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.000
And you'd see him before and up.

2511
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
And you could just see the look on their face,

2512
02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
like they are scared.

2513
02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:25.000
And what they're scared of is they're scared of getting,

2514
02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.000
getting killed and getting blown up.

2515
02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:27.000
That's fine.

2516
02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.000
They're scared of doing a bad job.

2517
02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:29.000
That's fine.

2518
02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:30.000
But what really is making them nervous is the fact

2519
02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:31.000
that they feel nervous.

2520
02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:32.000
They don't know what that feels like,

2521
02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.000
because they made it through training.

2522
02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.000
And they've jumped out of airplanes.

2523
02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.000
And they've, you know,

2524
02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
scuba dive that night off the coast.

2525
02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:38.000
And so they're,

2526
02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.000
they're used to being afraid.

2527
02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
And they don't feel fear anymore.

2528
02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.000
So they don't even understand what it feels like.

2529
02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.000
So they're almost something getting knots

2530
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.000
in their stomach.

2531
02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Their heart rates going.

2532
02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:46.000
And they,

2533
02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:47.000
that's what they're scared of.

2534
02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:48.000
They're like, why am I feeling like this?

2535
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.000
And it's freaking out.

2536
02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:50.000
So when you say,

2537
02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:51.000
ah,

2538
02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:52.000
hey, you,

2539
02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
you feel like you got some butterflies in your stomach right now.

2540
02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:54.000
You know,

2541
02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
feel like your heart's going a little bit.

2542
02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:56.000
And they're like,

2543
02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:57.000
and they're like,

2544
02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:58.000
you don't want to tell you the truth.

2545
02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:59.000
They're like, no, no, I feel fine.

2546
02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:00.000
It's like bullshit.

2547
02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:01.000
I can see.

2548
02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:02.000
And they go, yeah.

2549
02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:03.000
And say, cool,

2550
02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.000
you're just nervous.

2551
02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000
It's just your body getting ready for combat.

2552
02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.000
It's no big deal.

2553
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Everyone's going to feel like that.

2554
02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
And then they feel okay.

2555
02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:12.000
So situations that you're talking about where,

2556
02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:15.000
if you don't know what it is,

2557
02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:18.000
it's like that enough can can,

2558
02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
can make you fall.

2559
02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Whereas you say,

2560
02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.000
hey, listen,

2561
02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:23.000
after you get a big dopamine hit,

2562
02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.000
you're not going to feel fired up three hours later.

2563
02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
That's when you got to put in the work.

2564
02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
Be aware of the fact that you won't feel like doing it.

2565
02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Because people think,

2566
02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:34.000
we know what the other student feel like going anymore.

2567
02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.000
It's like, yeah,

2568
02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:36.000
of course you didn't.

2569
02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.000
You got all your dopamine and you already used it.

2570
02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
And you need to let that thing rebuild.

2571
02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
But you can still go get a good workout.

2572
02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
And you can go still complete the task.

2573
02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:44.000
You can go still write some more,

2574
02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:45.000
you know,

2575
02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.000
for your book that you're doing or do whatever labor you got to do.

2576
02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:52.000
So I think it's very important for people to understand what's going on inside.

2577
02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
So they don't feel like it's,

2578
02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
do you maybe what we want to do this?

2579
02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.000
You know,

2580
02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.000
maybe I don't even want to be here.

2581
02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.000
You know,

2582
02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:00.000
I'm not,

2583
02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:00.000
you know,

2584
02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:01.000
I just get to get to,

2585
02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:02.000
because I change it just to it night.

2586
02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Or in the afternoon.

2587
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000
And man,

2588
02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.000
when I was in the team,

2589
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:07.000
sometimes you come home and you're like,

2590
02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
do I really want to do this right now?

2591
02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.000
And I would just say,

2592
02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:10.000
yeah,

2593
02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.000
you do.

2594
02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Yeah,

2595
02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.000
it doesn't matter how you feel.

2596
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:13.000
You're just going to go do it.

2597
02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:14.000
So being able to overcome that,

2598
02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:17.000
I think that's what's nice about what you're informing us of

2599
02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
is people can now go,

2600
02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:19.000
oh,

2601
02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:20.000
I know what this is.

2602
02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
This isn't me being a whimp.

2603
02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
This isn't me,

2604
02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000
you know,

2605
02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:26.000
not wanting to do this.

2606
02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
It's my own natural,

2607
02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:29.000
you know,

2608
02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000
hormones that are doing this thing.

2609
02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Make me feel as way,

2610
02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.000
and I can just work through them.

2611
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Absolutely.

2612
02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Extremely well put.

2613
02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:35.000
You know,

2614
02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.000
earlier I mentioned

2615
02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
in the reference to sunlight,

2616
02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
I talked about dopamine and testosterone.

2617
02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
testosterone has a huge number of effects in the body.

2618
02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
And it's sibling molecule,

2619
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.000
if you will,

2620
02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:48.000
dihydrates testosterone is perhaps the more dominant

2621
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:49.000
and hydrogen in human.

2622
02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.000
dihydrotest.

2623
02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
D-h-t.

2624
02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Okay.

2625
02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000
You know,

2626
02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.000
there are pharmacologic versions of this,

2627
02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.000
right?

2628
02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Oxantialone,

2629
02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.000
and of war.

2630
02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.000
I'm not suggesting people take those, right?

2631
02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.000
What I'm talking about is the DHT,

2632
02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
you make naturally very powerful androgen.

2633
02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
It's converted from testosterone into,

2634
02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:07.000
you get DHT in a conversion of testosterone to DHT

2635
02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
through a molecule called five alpha reductase.

2636
02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Anytime you hear ACE,

2637
02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.000
it's almost always an enzyme.

2638
02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:12.000
ACE is basically,

2639
02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:13.000
you know,

2640
02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:13.000
cat,

2641
02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:14.000
the improtonase,

2642
02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:14.000
you know,

2643
02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:15.000
okay.

2644
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
So DHT,

2645
02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.000
it's going to cause some,

2646
02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
male pattern balnes, so this,

2647
02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:21.000
your widow's peak,

2648
02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
your widow's peak,

2649
02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:23.000
yep,

2650
02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
what was it widow's peak?

2651
02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:25.000
Uh,

2652
02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:26.000
so you can't tell.

2653
02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.000
My,

2654
02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.000
now elaborating widow's peak.

2655
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.000
That's dihydrates testosterone.

2656
02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Cause it beer growth on the face and causes,

2657
02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:32.000
male pattern balnes,

2658
02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:33.000
has inverse effect on the scalp and on the face.

2659
02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Like as other effects,

2660
02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
strength, et cetera.

2661
02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:40.000
The testosterone molecule in the dopamine molecule

2662
02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:41.000
bear a very close relationship.

2663
02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
So if somebody pushes pushes,

2664
02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:44.000
pushes really hard,

2665
02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:45.000
winds, winds,

2666
02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
yes, that will increase testosterone.

2667
02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Winning increases testosterone,

2668
02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:52.000
losing decreases testosterone in all venues.

2669
02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.000
So,

2670
02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:54.000
they look at this with,

2671
02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:55.000
with day traders,

2672
02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
win, win, win, win, win, win,

2673
02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.000
more money, they get more tests out.

2674
02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.000
They're losing,

2675
02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
okay, now here's the interesting thing.

2676
02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
I had an episode of the podcast with the great Robert

2677
02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Sapolsky,

2678
02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:05.000
why Zeebris don't get ulcers,

2679
02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
the trouble with testosterone, et cetera.

2680
02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Let's talk about the effects of testosterone and DHT

2681
02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.000
in the brain.

2682
02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
The main effect of these endrogens in the brain

2683
02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.000
is to make effort feel good.

2684
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Because of the way that testosterone and DHT

2685
02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.000
bind to receptors and activate certain components

2686
02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.000
of the amygdala.

2687
02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
We always think of the amygdala as a fear-centered,

2688
02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:27.000
but it's a threat detection center,

2689
02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
and it has a lot of different parts,

2690
02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
including parts that allow you to be

2691
02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
forward-centre of mass in response to pressure.

2692
02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
So,

2693
02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
my suggesting people take exogenous testosterone,

2694
02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
no, that's a personal choice that people can explore

2695
02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
on their own if they want to do that.

2696
02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:44.000
But if you've been pushing, pushing, pushing,

2697
02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.000
and winning, or just pushing really hard,

2698
02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
and then you've experienced that crash,

2699
02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.000
a lot of people need some time to recover

2700
02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.000
in order to be able to come back and be able to work hard again.

2701
02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
But here's what's really interesting.

2702
02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Not only does testosterone make effort feel good,

2703
02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.000
effort increases testosterone.

2704
02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
So, this is the athlete or the student

2705
02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000
who they don't want to do it,

2706
02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000
I don't want to do anything.

2707
02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Getting into some degree of forward-centre of mass.

2708
02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
I always say, I think I picked this up from a team

2709
02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.000
guys right in Team Guy language.

2710
02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.000
You can either be back on your heels,

2711
02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
or you can just go back to your flat foot,

2712
02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
or forward-centre of mass on anything.

2713
02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Getting into that forward-centre of mass,

2714
02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
mental orientation,

2715
02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
can start to trigger some of the pathways related

2716
02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
to these hormones and these neuromodulators.

2717
02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:27.000
What you don't want to do is start using a lot of exogenous factors.

2718
02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Caffeine,

2719
02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
or a lot of things outside of you in order

2720
02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:31.000
to try and create those states,

2721
02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
because then you're going to further deplete

2722
02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
your dopamine and so on.

2723
02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
When I think you went on a rogan at one point

2724
02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
and I overheard a portion of the conversation

2725
02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:40.000
where you said,

2726
02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
working really hard, and then you went on vacation,

2727
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
and then you got sick.

2728
02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:45.000
So this is interesting.

2729
02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.000
That's the autonomic nervous.

2730
02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:50.000
That's happening to me like numerous times.

2731
02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Okay, so there's a very clear explanation

2732
02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
for that in a very simple remedy,

2733
02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:55.000
although it's not obvious,

2734
02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
which is why many people experience this.

2735
02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Many people experience studying for finals,

2736
02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
and then it ends getting sick.

2737
02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Taking care of a loved one,

2738
02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.000
round the clock.

2739
02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
The person either gets better,

2740
02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
or sometimes dies, or whatever it is.

2741
02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:10.000
And then the caretaker gets sick.

2742
02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Why is that?

2743
02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Well, we always hear that stress compromises

2744
02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.000
the immune system.

2745
02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Nothing could be further from the truth.

2746
02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Stress activates the immune system.

2747
02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Think about how would your immune system

2748
02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
you're spleen and your other immune organs

2749
02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
of the body know when it's under pressure?

2750
02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
Well, you could have some foreign bacteria

2751
02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:29.000
virus in your body,

2752
02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
but when you are in a mode of go-go,

2753
02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
the molecule adrenaline triggers

2754
02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:36.000
the release of killer B cells and T cells from the spleen.

2755
02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
It's when you relax.

2756
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Now, you need to get your sleep,

2757
02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
but it's when you finally experience that

2758
02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:44.000
symmetric swing back of the C-Sauce.

2759
02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Go, go, go, go, go, boom.

2760
02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
And then you completely relax,

2761
02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.000
and you're hanging out with it,

2762
02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
and also you get the sniffle and the rest of the thing.

2763
02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
This is, there's a beautiful study done by

2764
02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:56.000
that was done in response to none other than

2765
02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:57.000
whim-haw, believe it or not.

2766
02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
There's a really beautiful quality scientific study.

2767
02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,

2768
02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
where they had two groups of people,

2769
02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:08.000
one group meditated, the other group did whim-haw-ftype breathing.

2770
02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:11.000
So what we call in the laboratory cyclic hyperventilation.

2771
02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
So inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, 25 times.

2772
02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:17.000
FOURSFUL INHALS and FOURSFUL EXHALS.

2773
02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Then hold your breath,

2774
02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.000
long, 70 for 15 seconds repeat for about three rounds.

2775
02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:25.000
What does that do? Why do you heat up adrenaline?

2776
02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.000
It's a generic thing.

2777
02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.000
It's adrenaline. You could've gotten into an ice bath, adrenaline.

2778
02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
You could have someone shout in your face,

2779
02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000
adrenaline.

2780
02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
It's just adrenaline. What do they do?

2781
02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
They injected both groups of people with E. coli.

2782
02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Inject in them with E. coli.

2783
02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.000
One group gets nauseous, vomiting and feel sick.

2784
02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:44.000
The group that does this cyclic hyperventilation whim-haw

2785
02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
also called two-motip breathing,

2786
02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:50.000
far fewer symptoms if any, including lack of fever.

2787
02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:55.000
So why? Well, they were able to combat the attack of this bacteria.

2788
02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:58.000
So if you're coming off of a hard-bought of work

2789
02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
and you're starting to relax into vacation,

2790
02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:03.000
you would be wise to still get into some cold water.

2791
02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:06.000
You would be wise to still do some cyclic hyperventilation breathing.

2792
02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Certainly don't do those at the same time.

2793
02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:11.000
A number of people actually have died doing cyclic hyperventilation

2794
02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:12.000
and then doing breath holds.

2795
02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Because when you exhale a lot of carbon dioxide,

2796
02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
carbon dioxide is the trigger to breathe.

2797
02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:17.000
This is really important.

2798
02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
If you do hyperventilation,

2799
02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:23.000
and then you hold your breath,

2800
02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
you can do a much longer breath hold than you could

2801
02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
if you just started off without having done that.

2802
02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Why?

2803
02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.000
You don't take breaths because of a need for oxygen,

2804
02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.000
although you do need that.

2805
02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
You take breaths because of a build-up of carbon dioxide.

2806
02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:38.000
Triggers these brainstem neurons, which have you do the gas-free flex.

2807
02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Okay.

2808
02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Well, if you dump all your carbon dioxide

2809
02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.000
and you're not a skilled free diver,

2810
02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
like Markili or somebody like that,

2811
02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.000
who really understands that what happens is you're swimming along.

2812
02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:50.000
Like, wow, I can really hold my breath down here

2813
02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
a long time, lights out.

2814
02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
And I shall am aware of a few people in the military community

2815
02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:57.000
who have dabbled with whim-haw,

2816
02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:00.000
two-month-type breathing and a diet, and it's not good.

2817
02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
I think it's not allowed, basically.

2818
02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.000
It's certainly not encouraged from what I understand.

2819
02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:08.000
So do it on land away from water.

2820
02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:12.000
And the idea here is that adrenaline protects us.

2821
02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
You don't want it cascading out of control

2822
02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:15.000
so that you can't sleep.

2823
02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.000
You want to use things like non-sleep,

2824
02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
depressed in the appropriate timing of light and exercise,

2825
02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
etc. to be able to sleep well at night

2826
02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
to reset all these systems.

2827
02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:26.000
But if you go too quickly from go-go-go-go to complete relaxation,

2828
02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:29.000
your immune system, your defense system will crash too.

2829
02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.000
And so you're not going to be able to fight off even the smallest

2830
02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.000
or the pettiest of viruses in bacteria.

2831
02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:36.000
That's when you get the sniff will get sick.

2832
02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
And like I'm finally resting, what's going on?

2833
02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:41.000
So you can taper out of those high intensity phases.

2834
02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
There are actually guys in the teams,

2835
02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:47.000
now that I think are aware of this and are starting to think about this

2836
02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:48.000
and for various effects.

2837
02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.000
But in the mind, testosterone makes effort feel good.

2838
02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Adrenaline puts us into a mode of readiness.

2839
02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:57.000
Don't put me and puts us into a mode of motivation.

2840
02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
And then there's the mirror side of all this,

2841
02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:02.000
which are the neurochemicals that broadly defined

2842
02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:05.000
promote relaxation and parasimpathetic activation.

2843
02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
And those come under the names that you've probably heard them before,

2844
02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:12.000
like serotonin, oxytocin, and the hormone prolactin.

2845
02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Serotonin and oxytocin are molecules that make us feel good,

2846
02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:20.000
make us feel soothed, not in response to things that were motivated

2847
02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.000
to go get, but in response to what we already have.

2848
02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:28.000
So this might sound a little woo, but if you sit there and do a gratitude practice,

2849
02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:32.000
or you hang out with your dog and your kids, or you eat a meal,

2850
02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:35.000
you're nourishing yourself with food that you are not in the process

2851
02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:36.000
and having to kill first.

2852
02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:39.000
You're just really in thanksgiving,

2853
02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:42.000
a few moments of appreciation, simple things.

2854
02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:45.000
The feel good that you experience the love and kindness

2855
02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
meditations, these kinds of things.

2856
02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:51.000
We know based on neuroimaging studies and blood draws and things of that sort,

2857
02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:54.000
and there's always some things like serotonin and oxytocin.

2858
02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:59.000
The nature has designed beautiful systems of pursuit and pleasure

2859
02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:03.000
that are designed to oscillate and designed to keep us in pursuit

2860
02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.000
in pleasure cycles.

2861
02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:07.000
In relationships, typically the dopamine phases that you're

2862
02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
early phase simultaneously in these cycles.

2863
02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:13.000
Oftentimes, not simultaneously, typically dopamine and serotonin

2864
02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:14.000
are released.

2865
02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:17.000
There's always some floating around our system at any moment,

2866
02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:20.000
but typically dopamine and adrenaline are associated

2867
02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:24.000
with pursuit of things that are outside the confines of our immediate possession

2868
02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:28.000
in our skin, and serotonin is more about the things that we have,

2869
02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:31.000
the things seeing your kid, holding your kid,

2870
02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
that promotes the release of oxytocin and serotonin.

2871
02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:34.000
It feels amazing.

2872
02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:38.000
These are the molecules that lead to our evolution as a species.

2873
02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:42.000
I'm not diminishing one or the other, but they need to oscillate.

2874
02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Early relationship, there are times when people aren't sleeping very much.

2875
02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
It's like a mental illness.

2876
02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
It's a form of mania.

2877
02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:50.000
They're so excited.

2878
02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:51.000
You don't need to sleep.

2879
02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:55.000
People are able to do all sorts of things that frequency and intensity

2880
02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:58.000
that they find themselves two years later in a relationship,

2881
02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
and they love the person.

2882
02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:04.000
It's very warm and cozy, but well, unless they're going off on deployments

2883
02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.000
and coming back, they don't have that reset of the system.

2884
02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:13.000
So, the ability to miss somebody, reset that pursuit and desire system.

2885
02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:17.000
These are powerful systems, and they don't just pertain to romantic relationships.

2886
02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
This is also school.

2887
02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:23.000
I always did summer school because I had to do a lot of catching up to do, based on the

2888
02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:26.000
lot of catching up.

2889
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:32.000
But there's some value in taking a week off, and realizing you are truly resetting all

2890
02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
the systems for pursuit.

2891
02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:38.000
I hear from a lot of hard driving folks who, like, wow, once I understood dopamine,

2892
02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:41.000
I realize why I'm so burnt out.

2893
02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
People think of adrenal burnout.

2894
02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:44.000
I guess what?

2895
02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
There's no actual medical term adrenal burnout.

2896
02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
There's adrenal insufficiency syndrome.

2897
02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:52.000
That's a rare syndrome, but you have enough adrenaline packed away in your brain

2898
02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
about three lifetimes.

2899
02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Think about what people used to go through.

2900
02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
I mean, you talk about some of this on your podcast.

2901
02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
You see the images of people and you read the stories.

2902
02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
You can make it through finals.

2903
02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Kids.

2904
02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:07.000
So, what happens though is we're in such modes of pursuit and overthinking over thinking,

2905
02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:10.000
we need to learn how to switch back and forth on a regular basis.

2906
02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.000
What I call deliberate decompression, or non-sleep deep rest,

2907
02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:18.000
have a practice each day of 10 to 30 minutes where you're not on your phone,

2908
02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
and you're in kind of a wordless state.

2909
02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:23.000
You're just either yoga, knee-dra, you're just relaxing,

2910
02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:26.000
or not watching anything, not taking in any sensory information,

2911
02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:33.000
not meditating, not journaling, just in a state of just trying to blank your mind.

2912
02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:38.000
And just watch how much stronger you come back in terms of your ability to focus in your motivation.

2913
02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:41.000
That's one I love the phone, and social media has been very good to me,

2914
02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
and I appreciate many of its features.

2915
02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:48.000
But one of the problems is we tend to fill our idle time with more sensory information,

2916
02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:51.000
and that doesn't allow us to go into this deliberate decompression.

2917
02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:54.000
It doesn't allow us to, you remember, I cut myself off,

2918
02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
but a picture is worth a thousand words,

2919
02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
while a movie is worth a million pictures.

2920
02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Now I can scroll through millions of movies very quickly,

2921
02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:04.000
and so the dopamine system is just a little bit overwhelmed.

2922
02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
I don't think we need to be off our phones all the time.

2923
02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:10.000
We just take some time to just deliberately decompress each day, any time of day.

2924
02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
And you'll focus better.

2925
02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:15.000
So you're getting hit with that dopamine on Instagram.

2926
02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:19.000
So at first you are, but here's how you know dopamine,

2927
02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
and it's just we'll give you a window into addiction.

2928
02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:26.000
If you're not an addict, you'll be able to sympathize with maybe an empathize with addicts,

2929
02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:27.000
of various kinds.

2930
02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:30.000
When you first get on social media, you're excited.

2931
02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Maybe you or Joe or somebody has a new podcast out, right?

2932
02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:34.000
You know, you're excited.

2933
02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
I can't wait to hear that's dopamine.

2934
02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.000
You're motivated.

2935
02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:41.000
But if you ever find yourself doing it behavior, and you kind of don't know why you're doing it,

2936
02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
like this doesn't feel any good anymore.

2937
02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:44.000
It's like that. What is that Chris?

2938
02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Well now he's a funny story there because new stuff,

2939
02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
but that Chris Rock thing where he's talking about like,

2940
02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:51.000
you know when you're shanking somebody and your heart's just not in it.

2941
02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Like, does this funny thing, right?

2942
02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.000
I think it was him.

2943
02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
You're sort of like, yeah, your heart's not in it.

2944
02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Like, why am I here? Why am I, what am I doing?

2945
02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:01.000
I'm not even getting any pleasure, but here I am,

2946
02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
like a, you know, rap pressing a lever.

2947
02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Well, that's the dopamine system has been

2948
02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:07.000
depleted.

2949
02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
And so what you need is some time away from it,

2950
02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:12.000
could be 10 minutes, could be 10 days.

2951
02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
And then it feels good again.

2952
02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:17.000
True for relationships, true for exercise.

2953
02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
You know, I believe in training hard and training often,

2954
02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
but if you train too hard, too often,

2955
02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:28.000
you can't bring the intensity that you need to get the stimulus to adapt and pretty soon you're either plateauing or getting worse.

2956
02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Here's the experiment I did with myself.

2957
02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:38.000
And I went in my ice bath and I had my, I was,

2958
02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:42.000
for whatever reason I would like wanted to see something on social media on Instagram.

2959
02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
So I was like, I'm just going to look at, I want to waste some time,

2960
02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:47.000
so I'm just going to wall and sit in the ice bath for, you know, five minutes.

2961
02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:50.000
I'm going to look at it, look at social media.

2962
02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:54.000
So I got, I'm, I'm on Instagram in my ice bath.

2963
02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:57.000
And normally you're in your ice bath and you're like,

2964
02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:58.000
how long I've been in here for?

2965
02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
You don't really want to look at your watch, you know?

2966
02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
It's like if I'm going to torture someone when they're in my ice bath,

2967
02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
I'm like, you've been in for 30 seconds.

2968
02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:05.000
That's 37 seconds.

2969
02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
That's someone to tell them every increment of time,

2970
02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
because you're not going to let it all blow together.

2971
02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:12.000
So you know, I always hold off on looking at my watch,

2972
02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
you know, when I'm in there, I'm just going to wait,

2973
02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:17.000
you know, because it's not going to be as long as you thought it was.

2974
02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
So I'm in that mode, I'm looking at Instagram.

2975
02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
So my hands aren't in it, but still.

2976
02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
It's like, I'm, I'm looking at Instagram.

2977
02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:26.000
And I go, how long has it been?

2978
02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
It's probably been, it's probably been,

2979
02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:32.000
it's probably been at least, I'm probably at the three minute mark right now.

2980
02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:35.000
I roll over, look at my watch, I'm at like five, 20.

2981
02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:38.000
So I got that way.

2982
02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:41.000
That's how people look at their freaking screen.

2983
02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:44.000
And all of a sudden, they look up and they've wasted 28 minutes on there.

2984
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Because I mean, I was in it, in cold water, you know?

2985
02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
And time went by a little bit quicker.

2986
02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Imagine if you're sitting in a relaxing chair or whatever,

2987
02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:56.000
you know, that's just going to slip by you and next thing,

2988
02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:59.000
you know, you've been looking at your phone for 22 minutes or a half an hour.

2989
02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:02.000
You know, you can write 500 words for a book and a half an hour.

2990
02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:06.000
You know, like you can do, you can do a lot of things in half an hour

2991
02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
that are going to benefit you as a human being.

2992
02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Instagram isn't one of them.

2993
02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Right.

2994
02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.000
The algorithm is going to get you.

2995
02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:13.000
That's right.

2996
02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:14.000
It's going to get you.

2997
02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:18.000
And if you want to create content, you build the raw materials.

2998
02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:25.000
You find and build on the raw materials for that content away from the place where you distribute that content.

2999
02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:28.000
I always tell myself that I love reading scientific papers and books,

3000
02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
but Instagram can draw me in too.

3001
02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:34.000
And I always say the gems exist outside of social media.

3002
02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:37.000
And I want to bring those to the podcast and to social media.

3003
02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:41.000
So the deep writing read into the library or to these papers, the more I can bring.

3004
02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:45.000
I'm glad you brought up time perception because dopamine and serotonin

3005
02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
and the states they are associated with.

3006
02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:50.000
So broadly speaking, dopamine and adrenaline,

3007
02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:54.000
were serotonin and oxytocin or associated with different perceptions of time.

3008
02:22:54.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Here's the best way to think about this is if you've ever had a day that was really exciting.

3009
02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Or I think to an op that was particularly exciting or difficult or challenging required a lot of focus.

3010
02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:12.000
It's amazing how quickly you perceive that day going by.

3011
02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:16.000
But then when you look back on it, it feels like so much happened.

3012
02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Now think about waiting in the doctor's office.

3013
02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:26.000
It feels like it goes on forever. And yet you look back on it and it feels like nothing happened.

3014
02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Dopamine and adrenaline change our perception of time.

3015
02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:34.000
We've micro-sliced time, but it seems like everything goes by really fast.

3016
02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:37.000
And then when we look back, like we did this and then we did that.

3017
02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:40.000
And we did that. I think when you're a 10 year old and it's your birthday.

3018
02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:43.000
And so much happened, so much dopamine.

3019
02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Then think about the most boring phase of doing nothing.

3020
02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:51.000
You look back nothing happened. Why? It's all about how these neuromodulators shift our perception of time.

3021
02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:55.000
Our gaze and our understanding of the outside world and so on.

3022
02:23:55.000 --> 02:24:01.000
So you can imagine that if you're on Instagram and you're scrolling and scrolling and not a whole lot is happening.

3023
02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:06.000
And yet you go, oh my god, time. All this time went by but nothing happened.

3024
02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:09.000
Well, you're not in a high dopamine state.

3025
02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:13.000
When you're in a high dopamine state, you will know because life feels exciting.

3026
02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:18.000
You'll almost feel a readiness in your nervous system because some people even tremble a little bit.

3027
02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:21.000
That's the readiness for action because again, these are generic molecules.

3028
02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:29.000
They didn't evolve for social media or for gunfights or for rolling jiu-jitsu or for taking final exams or studying for them.

3029
02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:34.000
They evolved either put us into states of readiness and pursuit or relaxation.

3030
02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:40.000
And so once you understand that we all have both systems in us, but that some people,

3031
02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:45.000
the seesaw is just naturally tilted a little bit toward one side or the other.

3032
02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Excuse me. Then you're in a position of really control it as opposed to controlling you.

3033
02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:54.000
And there's a term that I like to use when thinking about this.

3034
02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:58.000
We all think about stress but really there are two kinds of stress.

3035
02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:03.000
There's the, I'm too activated. I'm too alert and I need to calm down.

3036
02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:07.000
And then there's the, I'm too calm and I need to lean into action.

3037
02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:10.000
And I refer to this as limbic friction.

3038
02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Your limbic system controls these very basic states of being alert or being stressed or being calm.

3039
02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:21.000
But your forebrain, this incredible real estate just behind your forehead,

3040
02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:25.000
is what controls what we call top down modulation.

3041
02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:28.000
It's the look at the watch. It's 445.

3042
02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:31.000
Jocco is already up. I need to do this. But wait, hold on.

3043
02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:36.000
If I get into action adrenaline will come thoughts actually allow us to overcome our limbic tendency

3044
02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:37.000
to just want to go back to sleep.

3045
02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:41.000
Or if I'm very, very stressed, I can quickly calm down.

3046
02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:44.000
I can just pass along. There's actually a physiological tool to calm down.

3047
02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:47.000
It wasn't discovered by me. It was discovered in the 1930s.

3048
02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:54.000
There's a pattern of breathing that every person and every mammal does when carbon dioxide builds

3049
02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:57.000
up too much in the bloodstream. And it's called a physiological side.

3050
02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:00.000
This is two inhales through your nose.

3051
02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:03.000
And then a long full exhale. Looks crazy.

3052
02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:06.000
But believe it or not, we all do this once every five minutes or so.

3053
02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:12.000
This podcast is like the documentation of the release of that.

3054
02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Because I'll be reading something just super stressful or even talking to someone

3055
02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
that was an octaribal situation.

3056
02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:23.000
You can go to those in this podcast and you'll hear like,

3057
02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:26.000
just silence and you'll hear me go.

3058
02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Like it's so obvious that I do that to release the stress that I have from,

3059
02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:38.000
you know, listening to someone or dragging some horrible story out of someone.

3060
02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Exhales slow the heart down, inhale, speed the heart up.

3061
02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
There's something called respiratory cytosatrythme.

3062
02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:50.000
So for when you inhale, basically what happens is your diaphragm moves down, right?

3063
02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:54.000
You actually moves down. There's actually more space in your,

3064
02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:58.000
the cavity that your heart sits in, blood flows more slowly through that larger volume.

3065
02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:01.000
Heart got a little bigger. The brain sends a signal, speed the heart up.

3066
02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:04.000
When you exhale, that diaphragm moves up, heart gets a little smaller,

3067
02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
blood moves more quickly through that smaller space.

3068
02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:09.000
Brain sends a signal to slow the heart down.

3069
02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:13.000
If you increase the duration or the intensity of exhales relative to inhales,

3070
02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:17.000
you'll calm down. Increase the intensity or the duration of inhales relative to exhales.

3071
02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:21.000
You will become more alert through these brainstem centers that we're not discovered by me.

3072
02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:25.000
But by this brilliant guy at UCLA named Jack Feldman who found the two brain areas that

3073
02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:30.000
responsible for this physiological size, reopen all the small sacks in the lungs so that you

3074
02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:34.000
can then offload the maximum amount of carbon dioxide when you exhale.

3075
02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:37.000
So the big deep inhale through the nose and then squeeze in a little bit more air,

3076
02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:42.000
re-inflates the little sacks in the lungs and allows you to offload carbon dioxide on the long

3077
02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
exhale that follows. You do this in sleep.

3078
02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
People who have apnea don't do this well.

3079
02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Appnea is very dangerous. It actually will shorten your life, lead to all sorts of issues.

3080
02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:56.000
Not good. People who use the CPAP or they'll learn to mouth-breed,

3081
02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:00.000
they're due to these kinds of things. You can also use physiological size between rounds and

3082
02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:05.000
gejitsu to calm down if you want to calm down or you can do more inhales if you want to ramp up.

3083
02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:09.000
I mean, fighters know this stuff intuitively and they know how to use breath.

3084
02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:14.000
But none of these are hacks. These are defined circuits that we all come into the world with.

3085
02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:18.000
And the reason I say they're not hacks is they work the first time and they work every time because

3086
02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:22.000
guess what you're using them all the time anyway. We're just not normally aware.

3087
02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:28.000
And so you can when you're speaking a lot oftentimes you'll feel stressed because you're not taking a few

3088
02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:32.000
moments to do these double inhales and exhale. So I'm doing now.

3089
02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:37.000
But if you have in trouble sleeping, do some long exhale breathing. You'll notice you'll calm down.

3090
02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:41.000
So I call these real time tools because they don't involve stepping away from what you're doing.

3091
02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:45.000
The other cool thing about the physiological size that the nerve that controls the diaphragm is called the

3092
02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:51.000
frenic nerve and it has a little branch we call this a collateral that goes to the liver and a few other organs.

3093
02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:55.000
If you're ever running and you get that side stitch, it's you think it's a cramp.

3094
02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:59.000
That is not a cramp. That has to do with your pattern of breathing and the movement of the diaphragm.

3095
02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:05.000
And the frenic nerve sometimes gets into a pattern of firing that's not quite often when you're getting what's called

3096
02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:11.000
referred pain of the liver and the pain inside the body is not as precise as it is on the surface of the body.

3097
02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:17.000
What do you do? Well, we used to be told, though, you run with your hands over your head or you need more water.

3098
02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:23.000
All you have to do is a few physiological size and you'll reset the pattern of breathing to the correct motion.

3099
02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:27.000
So the next time you have a side stitch or a cramp, just do a few double inhale exhales while running and that

3100
02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
referred pain will just disappear.

3101
02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:39.000
So you mentioned the limbic system. So I'm sitting here, you're painting this picture when you're talking about serotonin

3102
02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:45.000
and your testosterone and dopamine. You get this picture head like, wow, every human being should just be running

3103
02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:51.000
at this optimum thing where, hey, I'm going to go get some testosterone award reward from my dopamine

3104
02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:55.000
and then when I'm done with that, I'm going to go hug my kids and it seems like we should be in this perfect cycle

3105
02:29:55.000 --> 02:30:01.000
of where everything is great because we either in pursuit or we're on gratitude and this is great.

3106
02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:09.000
Unfortunately, we all know that that's not the reality and people end up in this weird thing where they don't go in

3107
02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:13.000
in pursuit. And matter of fact, they don't go in pursuit at all. They don't even get off the couch.

3108
02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:19.000
We have people that don't appreciate what they've got. And so, so is that the limbic?

3109
02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:26.000
What is the opposing force to these two totally positive things that we've got out there of, hey, I've got this dopamine

3110
02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:30.000
reward system when I go out. I'm going to do some squats. I'm going to feel great when I get done.

3111
02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:34.000
I'm going to see my dog. I'm going to pet him. I'm going to feel great. Like life is great.

3112
02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:39.000
What is the opposing force on these things that trips us up?

3113
02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Very important question. And fortunately or unfortunately, we have an answer, which is that we can now access

3114
02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:52.000
dopamine release without any effort at all.

3115
02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:56.000
High, flavor, high calorie density food.

3116
02:30:56.000 --> 02:31:01.000
Right? It's probably rare in nature at one point. We had to work hard in order to get

3117
02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:10.000
game, get grains, get berries. So it was used to be effort, dopamine, relaxation, repeat.

3118
02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Now, you can get enough dopamine from food. Remember the rat just sitting there?

3119
02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:23.000
It doesn't, it won't cross the cage, because as no dopamine, but most people are like the rat just sitting there just

3120
02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:29.000
popping. I saw this on the plane and I'm not being disparaging of anybody, but I sat down next to this person.

3121
02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:36.000
And it was, and I was not shocked. I was actually just really dismayed. This person was sitting there kind of like

3122
02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:40.000
hooded eyes. I don't think they had been drinking alcohol. Didn't smell like it.

3123
02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Just popping cheetos into their mouth like a rat just feeding from a dispenser. Just the whole time just passively.

3124
02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:53.000
Right? So you gain in this low level of dopamine. Lots of calories, lots of with no activity.

3125
02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Yes, their phenotype as we'd say in biology was as you would predict. And it was just really sad.

3126
02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:03.000
There was no, there was, I think that when it's, it's fair to say that

3127
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Dop, high levels of dopamine achieved without effort will destroy a person. Whether or not that comes through a high potency drug or a

3128
02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:20.000
high potency food, if it comes within an intensity and a frequency that's too high that doesn't require effort, it will destroy a person.

3129
02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:26.000
So what else is there? There's food. We can get a dopamine hit from cheetos. Anything pleasurable.

3130
02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Yeah, I would say this TV work. Yeah, I would say I'm here on borrowing from onalemkeys work. She's a, again, a medical doctor who focuses on dopamine and addiction, but also behaviors

3131
02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:44.000
that relate to addiction video game addiction, for instance. So social media or YouTube addiction. I can give you a one very saline example this.

3132
02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:53.000
When we're getting, you know, let's say that dopamine, it doesn't work actually work this way, but let's just say with arbitrary units can be released anywhere from zero to a hundred level.

3133
02:32:53.000 --> 02:33:03.000
Let's say, methemphetamine is a hundred because we know it does evoke a lot of dopamine. You release. Let's say a nice pizza after a good long run is 20.

3134
02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:15.000
What about a nice pizza after watching a Netflix show? Yeah, is that I'm saying is that is there is that also going to be a 20 or is that only a 10 because you didn't really earn it.

3135
02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:25.000
Well, it can be very pleasurable, but what's going to happen is that you're still getting dopamine and it's incremental. Remember I said earlier stacking dopamine is dangerous.

3136
02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:32.000
It's not that you have one reservoir or one kind of hydraulic system putting a pressure for dopamine and then you spend it all and it comes back.

3137
02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:41.000
You have multiple things. So if you're listening to music and you're eating and you're having a good time, that's great. I mean, that's life. I mean, we want to encourage people not be total stoics and they want to enjoy life.

3138
02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:50.000
But what's going to end up happening if you're just sitting there eating high calorie food, taking in a lot of sensory information that has you really wrapped with attention.

3139
02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:55.000
There's really no incentive to be motivated to do anything else at a biological level.

3140
02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:07.000
So then someone's in fact, I was talking to my podcast producer. He had a friend in college that was a spectacular student early on and got really into video games and there came the data move out of their house.

3141
02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:12.000
And everyone was packing up and moving out and this guy didn't have his stuff together and the trucks were literally coming.

3142
02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:20.000
It's like, and they realized he actually can't do anything. He's only seems to be getting his dopamine from this one behavior.

3143
02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:32.000
I have a close friend who's son graduated from high school was going to community college and pretty soon developed what he thought was a case of pretty severe ADHD and depression.

3144
02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:39.000
Obviously that can happen. Young guy, no, no, he's always been a swimmer and an athlete, very impressive kid. Good looking kid, always very sociable.

3145
02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:47.000
And pretty soon he wasn't going to his community college classes. He wasn't working, no relationship living at home with the parents. This is what they call fairly or to launch.

3146
02:34:47.000 --> 02:35:04.000
I'm going to say, pretty scary at 20, much scarier 25. He heard on a lengthy talk to on a different podcast about the dopamine system. And he realized that he spent all his time on YouTube video games. He got a little bit into crypto and was kind of dabbling there nothing.

3147
02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:14.000
And he went on a complete fast of all these things. And I'm pleased to say that he's complete now. He's now lives with his girlfriend. He's got a job. He's completely off any ADHD meds.

3148
02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:22.000
And I realize some people do need these ADHD meds. Guess what ADHD meds are. Riddle in, adder all, vivants. They all trigger the release of dopamine.

3149
02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:30.000
It's a way of getting dopamine. And some people really need that. But you can imagine if you're getting it from all these sensory stimuli, YouTube, et cetera.

3150
02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:36.000
And listen, I love YouTube. I appreciate them. But you, it's a potent stimulus. You can find pretty much anything on there.

3151
02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:49.000
And so the key, you asked, why are we so off balance? Why can't we just do this naturally? Because naturally, we just want pleasure. We really do as a species, just seek pleasure and avoid pain.

3152
02:35:49.000 --> 02:36:03.000
All species do that. And now it takes a very deliberate, for brain-oriented person who really actually associates their value in their self image with effort and reward, not just reward,

3153
02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:12.000
to get through this jungle of, you know, plants that can basically just grab us and pull us down. And we see it everywhere.

3154
02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:21.000
And it should not surprise us at all. And so is the key to completely discard with any pleasures? No. The key is put effort in front of pleasure.

3155
02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:29.000
And you will have a, and learn how to relax and access these other systems of serotonin, et cetera, and appreciation.

3156
02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:39.000
If you can do that, you can completely control the trajectory of your life. But pleasure without effort preceding it is absolutely deadly.

3157
02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:51.000
It's, you could be in on this one echo variable rewards. So like even when you're looking at YouTube, right? And you click on a video.

3158
02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:59.000
And it looks good. It's got a good thumbnail. Right? It's good to click. Big eyes. They told us you know thumbnails with crazy eyes actually get more clicks.

3159
02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:03.000
Okay. So there you go. So you get Lord in on that, but it's not quite as good as you want.

3160
02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:09.000
So then, but you see another one. And so you click on that one. And it's not quite as good. But then you click on one. It's all this pretty good.

3161
02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:14.000
You know, it had a good freaking car crash in it or whatever it is that you wanted to see.

3162
02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:25.000
And so then, if you get that variable reward in Instagram, you get it in YouTube and, and where it's like you get a little spike like, oh there it is.

3163
02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:33.000
That that was a really good meme or whatever. That one made me laugh. You know, you have to look at seven memes that are dumb.

3164
02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:38.000
And then you see a good one. And then you go, well, maybe the next one would be good too. And you want that little hit.

3165
02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:47.000
It's freaking disturbing. How's it doing with anticipation, right? Or something like that? Yes. You guys are are team me up with the exact language.

3166
02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:53.000
So the best schedule for maintaining motivation over time is called random intermittent reinforcement.

3167
02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:59.000
This is what the slot machines do. This is gambling. The reason people go to Vegas go, I like to do a little bit of gambling.

3168
02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:05.000
I like to sit there. I like the dumb gambling. I like roulette. I just like to sit there and watch the wheel go.

3169
02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:12.000
I don't like to have a thing too hard or look at the cards or anything. Just put things on numbers and eventually get something and go. You know, sometimes I win sometimes I lose.

3170
02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:19.000
But it's always a set amount. Why do I like this? Well, something's boring, boring, and then boom, you hit.

3171
02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:28.000
You hit. You get 18 to one on something. That's random intermittent reinforcement is the most powerful reinforcement schedule in all species for all things.

3172
02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Some people even all species, all things, all species random, all mammalian species intermittent reward.

3173
02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:43.000
Yeah, give a rat a reward for pressing a lever every time. It actually will press that lever less often. It'll get its dopamine fix.

3174
02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Right? It's the person next meeting, Cheetos on the plane. They'll keep doing it, but not with this. They won't work to do it.

3175
02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:57.000
Whereas if you give it to them every fifth time animals and people learn intuitively, they're not necessarily even counting. They just know how fast they need to press before they get it again.

3176
02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Random intermittent reinforcement means if you're not expecting a reward, you get more dopamine.

3177
02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:12.000
So you set anticipation. So there's something in the dopamine literature that is called reward prediction error.

3178
02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:21.000
If you anticipate a reward and it comes, you get some dopamine. If you don't anticipate a reward and it comes, you get even more dopamine from the same reward.

3179
02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:28.000
And if you anticipate a reward and it doesn't come, guess what, dopamine drops below baseline.

3180
02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:32.000
Hey kids, we're going to go get ice cream. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You get to the ice cream shop closed.

3181
02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:38.000
Ooh, not good. You crash them below. Now you're negotiating trips to Disneyland.

3182
02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Right? If you are walking by an ice cream shop, you turn to them and you say, ice cream?

3183
02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:54.000
Bigger dopamine release from the actual ice cream. This is a very powerful modulator of our behavior. So anticipation is key because remember, dopamine isn't about the pleasure.

3184
02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:59.000
Dopamine is about the anticipation of pleasure. And there are beautiful experiments if people want to learn more about this.

3185
02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:07.000
Just put reward prediction error. The guy will from Schultz. Yes, was the guy who over in Germany who discovered a reward prediction error.

3186
02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:13.000
He found that the neurons in the brain that control dopamine release are firing before you get the reward.

3187
02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:23.000
And then you get the reward and goes up a little bit and then drops. And that drop is the pain that you feel afterwards. Why to keep animals and humans motivated to go pursue more.

3188
02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:30.000
And a lot of our behavior can be understood through reward prediction error. This also pertains again human relationships.

3189
02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:36.000
Don't tell somebody a restaurant is so incredible or a blank is so incredible. Don't build yourself up to be so incredible.

3190
02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:48.000
If you want to actually be experienced as that incredible anticipation is wonderful, but then you better bring it because if you don't, you are going to sink dopamine way lower than you would have otherwise.

3191
02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:59.000
So surprise is one of the wonderful elements of the dopamine circuitry. And if you think about an animal foraging for food or a human foraging for food, this is what led to people looking for game to kill.

3192
02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:05.000
Well, you're a hunter, right? You're maybe your hunter as well. I've done a hunting, but I've done some fishing and I'm like, oh, this is a vom's.

3193
02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:10.000
Pretty nice. I'm good. And it's pretty good. What are you hunt for? And just kidding.

3194
02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:24.000
And it's a real stretch to call me hunter. I got in hunting a few years ago and have been going hunting each year. Very cool, very, very rewarding, very difficult, very, very rewarding.

3195
02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:36.000
Yeah, it's, you know, because that's a very dynamic system as our gunfights and whatnot. It's not just about hitting targets on a range, obviously the other person or the animal gets a vote too.

3196
02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:52.000
And so that's that we we crave that as human beings and combat taps into that and basic mating interactions and the things that lead up to that, you know, the the dance that is human evolution of of mating and aggression and all these other things.

3197
02:41:52.000 --> 02:42:02.000
You know, all tap into the dopamine system and we experience winds and then we try and make predictions about where we will experience winds again based on our previous history.

3198
02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:10.000
And yet what keeps us, it will be so boring if you always knew the deer was going to be standing right next to that tree looking at you, right?

3199
02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:19.000
One reason I like campaigns as videos and I watch those is I love the unpredictability of it. I'm also always amazed at how many objects are in front of them and obviously a very skilled hunter.

3200
02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:35.000
So it's the uncertainty that that certainly people in special operations, you know, it's defined by uncertainty. The rules are set and yet there's this huge set of variables for which you need to be able to adapt in real time.

3201
02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:38.000
That's going to lead to more dopamine increase than anything else.

3202
02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:48.000
Yeah, it's it's interesting because the the hunting thing like how does it compare to combat? I've had guys ask me that and there's a really big difference is that

3203
02:42:48.000 --> 02:43:00.000
that you know that thing's not going to shoot back at you, but if you go and hunt like a grizzly bear with a bow and arrow and you mess up that thing absolutely will kill you.

3204
02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:14.000
So that does go that does get very close to the the same kind of a scenario that you're dealing with and I'm sure the dopamine hit and I haven't hunted any barrier, but that's got to be a next level.

3205
02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Absolutely, I remember backpacking in glacier and running into a bear cub pop you know the eaten berries on the trail. We took the bear bell off, you know those bear bells are really annoying.

3206
02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:37.000
The whole time walk with these bear bells and let's take these bear bells off ignore the range and you know and we're hiking out and sure enough is a bear cub sitting there and you go, first you go bear cub and then you go bear cub.

3207
02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:48.000
So absolutely there's you know these systems again are oriented toward our survival or reproduction are drive when we meet people that are very driven.

3208
02:43:48.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Typically it's because they have systems like yourself like yourself. I'm in these systems almost always are designed to overcome whatever for too early or as limbic friction.

3209
02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:17.000
It's rarely that someone has just a system of making everything easy that allows them to be continually motivated. I think this is one of the big misconceptions people think oh and we've done episodes on the human and lapar has like workspace optimization and I always sort of hesitate to do these episodes because it's true.

3210
02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:32.000
You put your computer screen up as opposed to looking down it you'll be alert for longer because of what we're talking about before eye positioning. If you have a standing desk you probably alert because standing actually you know and so on and so forth. But when you find is that people that display

3211
02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:45.000
motivation over long periods of time have systems that put them into limbic friction and then overcome limbic friction again and again remember effort then reward.

3212
02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:50.000
And many people are looking for the tools the hacks and the tricks that are going to take all the effort part out.

3213
02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:58.000
What you want to do is build the effort and the limbic friction in and then the reward in on a consistent basis brief me again on the limbic friction.

3214
02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:14.000
Yeah, so where's that common from yeah so you have areas of the brain the old days people used to call them ancient and then now people don't like that but basically there are parts of the brain that exist in humans and in other animals like the hypothalamus which is a cluster of neurons basically above the roof of your mouth.

3215
02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:29.000
And it's a little tiny real estate within the nervous system but controls things like motivation aggression rage sex behavior temperature. These are clusters of new of what we call new clear little clusters of neurons.

3216
02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:48.000
And these different primitive states so much so that if I were to just tickle one of those within electrode I could put you into a rage state like that. There's a wonderful video for people want to see it it's a little disturbing for people can't handle this stuff from David Anderson's lab at Caltech you put you can put Anderson lab aggression mating into YouTube to mice.

3217
02:45:48.000 --> 02:46:03.000
Electrode in an area of the brain called ventramedio hypothalamus stimulate one category of neurons in there using some neuroscience tricks and the animal immediately goes over and starts to mate with the female animal okay.

3218
02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:21.000
And turn those neurons off there ways you can do this instantaneously and remotely turn on the neurons in the ventramedio hypothalamus that are distinct from those and the animal starts to kill the other animal. Put that animal alone in a cage with a glove filled with air stimulate these neurons it tries to kill the glove.

3219
02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:37.000
Looks like a kid at an elastic front show it's just swing is armed like that you know just rage although that's a controlled rage so we have switches in the hypothalamus then we have this real estate that we call the prefrontal cortex which is controls rational decision making.

3220
02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:57.000
Has access to the hippocampus with information about the past the present and the future right when we're in the states of rage it's all about now states of stress it's all about now states of fear it's all about now the prefrontal cortex can draw on a memory bank of experiences from the past the present and future for better or for worse and say.

3221
02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:10.000
The last time we tried to cross this bridge with our team things didn't work out so well let's stop let's think or we're under attack you immediately want to respond.

3222
02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:17.000
You guys called swift violent action but sometimes I'm guessing there's a time to like regroup swift violent action in a more successful way.

3223
02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:28.000
I'm just borrowing language from your community. That ability to tamp down basic physiological responses is controlled by the forebrain.

3224
02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:35.000
Suppressing the limbic pathways so there's a friction between our rational mind and these impulses.

3225
02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:49.000
There's a famous case of the guy that was working on the railways every psychology student learns about this spike. Despite through his forebrain it went through orbital frontal cortex that's prefrontal cortex what happened well the story goes that he became sort of inappropriate so if you didn't like you he'd tell you.

3226
02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:57.000
I don't like you swear you you went to church before as a real good guy after that he was you know screaming at people and call profanities and things like that.

3227
02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:09.000
There's a condition called clover busy syndrome which relates to a different brain area but also the forebrain where animals or people will start to mate with inanimate objects.

3228
02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:22.000
Right this is inappropriate behavior according to the limbic system but they don't see as inappropriate because they they're forebrain is shut down. So limbic friction describes the the tension in this neural circuitry between the forebrain and these reflexes.

3229
02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:31.000
And remember it has two sides one is the ability to suppress action and the other is the ability to engage action when you would otherwise want to be relaxed.

3230
02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:38.000
And because not because some of the areas of the hypothalamus are involved in relaxation. So you want to stay in bed.

3231
02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:50.000
I'm be honest you know for me I hope for many people there's a strong pull to stay under the covers and sleep longer tell yourself that you know you heard on a podcast it sleeps important. You know all this stuff. You dive dementia. You don't sleep enough.

3232
02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
And you have to tell yourself no.

3233
02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:57.000
No it's the effort followed by the reward that I'll feel later that's the ticket.

3234
02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:12.000
And so that's an example of limbic friction that you overcome where the forebrain takes over now you're in action you're in forward center of mass or your ex so that's overcoming exhaustion or so the so the limbic system can screw you in both ways.

3235
02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:21.000
It could screw me in like I lose my temper and I attack you and I end up going to jail because I because I stabbed you in the neck because I lost my temper.

3236
02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:31.000
I can also screw me by hey you know you don't really don't feel like going to work out right now and you just stay in bed because it's nice and comfortable here.

3237
02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:35.000
So you're living system. Yeah well then you can rationalize that.

3238
02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:36.000
Sure.

3239
02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:48.000
But that's a limbic system driving me to just want to stay in bed or want to hey you know this freaking cotton candy tastes great and I should just eat more of it and just keep shoving into my mouth.

3240
02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:57.000
And that's a limbic system in action. That's right and a lot of treatments for phobias and anxiety disorders that are related to cognitive behavioral therapy are progressive exposure.

3241
02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:02.000
So a person afraid of snakes you can picture of a snake then you have the imagines snake then they're looking at rubber snake then they're holding a snake.

3242
02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:07.000
What are you doing you're you're allowing them to get into small incremental steps of forward action.

3243
02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:13.000
They get them closer and closer but you're to the anxiety but you're also ratcheting down the anxiety.

3244
02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:21.000
What I'm talking about and I think what the practice is that you've talked a lot about really relate to is recognizing that friction of being tired but

3245
02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:30.000
knowing that you should get into action or that feeling of being too amped up and knowing you need to calm down means going against yourself

3246
02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:34.000
in a way that is not incremental sometimes can feel huge.

3247
02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:41.000
This is why I think you know anyone who's going to try and ice bath don't freeze to death, but you know start at 45 degrees and move your limbs around

3248
02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:49.000
and experience what a lot of adrenaline is really like and you know if you do it appropriately you won't die and you will come out of there.

3249
02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:54.000
You'll get that dopamine rush and the thing to think about is not how great it feels.

3250
02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:57.000
You want to think about how hard it is and then how great it feels.

3251
02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:06.000
Those two things need to be coupled in one's mind and the power of mindset is something that has been talked about all the time the secret or on the you know in social media but

3252
02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:12.000
I have a colleague at Stanford seems like I only refer to experiments at Stanford but hey it's a good place.

3253
02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:16.000
If there is an analog to the seal teens in academia can we borrow that.

3254
02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:17.000
Sorry.

3255
02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:21.000
There are other good places to there are some schools on the east coast I hear as well.

3256
02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:29.000
I'm just kidding but I do that for the home team but there are experiments elsewhere of course but my colleague Ali Chrome.

3257
02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:36.000
Her name is Ali but she goes by Ali Chrome is a professor psychology, tenure professor psychology, former division one athlete,

3258
02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:41.000
trained clinical psychologists and actually her dad is a martial artist and has done some work with your community.

3259
02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:45.000
In credit and she has a few papers on seals and I'll explain what those are.

3260
02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:51.000
She studies mind sets and the power of mindset and she studies the physiology so none of this stuff is wishy wash.

3261
02:51:51.000 --> 02:52:00.000
And here's the interesting thing you take two groups of people she's taken two groups of people one group watches a movie about stress the other group watches a movie about stress.

3262
02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:09.000
The first group watches a movie about stress and learns all the true information about stress disrupts your memory.

3263
02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:16.000
It causes deficiencies in decision making and blah blah blah all the terrible things that stress can do the other group.

3264
02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:25.000
Learns all the positive things that stress can do can activate your immune system can sharpen your focus can enhance your memory if it's done in the appropriate way etc.

3265
02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:36.000
Then you test people with a number of things like memory tests you test their immune system you do blood draws you look at how much stress hormone they're making guess what whatever you learned and believe that's what happens.

3266
02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:40.000
They've done the same experiment with two milkshakes.

3267
02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:47.000
Okay, you give one group a milkshake you tell them this is a high calorie high fat high sugar milkshake. There's lots of nutrients in it.

3268
02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:53.000
You give the other group a milkshake you say this is a modest a low calorie milkshake.

3269
02:52:53.000 --> 02:53:00.000
Then you have them drink the milkshake you take blood draws and you look at the insulin response you look at the amount of

3270
02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:11.000
insulin which is a hunger hormone that's secreted in response to hunger makes you hungry basically and guess what it's the same milkshake and yet you get higher insulin response to the high calorie.

3271
02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:19.000
The thought that it's a high calorie shake you get lower insulin all you still get insulin response in response to the idea that it's a lower calorie shake.

3272
02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:29.000
The relevant response is suppressed so you get your hunger doesn't show up for longer if you have the so-called high calorie shake, stays off hunger.

3273
02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:41.000
Whereas if you have the low calorie shake you're hungry again earlier and grow in levels go back up really all based on belief and their numerous things like this and so all these words are the best words for this and I'm probably not going to get them exactly right.

3274
02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:53.000
But what we do and the physiological consequences of what we do is the consequence of what we do what we eat, how we exercise but also what we believe about what we do.

3275
02:53:53.000 --> 02:54:05.000
Now this does not mean that you can just lie to yourself you can't say all of this you know you know four by four from in and out is only a hamburger and it's not going to have a big insulin that doesn't work but what you can do.

3276
02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
What is your protein style?

3277
02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:11.000
Pretty safe. Where there's the flying Dutchman I've heard you know that one. I haven't had the voice.

3278
02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:19.000
I think that's just meat on a piece of paper. Okay. So now all those carnivores are going to be you know going to that's where I give costella my bulldog.

3279
02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:35.000
I think they still use that. The off the menu menu. So basically if you tell yourself the friction that I'm feeling of not wanting to get out of bed and the reward I will feel later actually is building a system within me and that is a true statement.

3280
02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:47.000
You will build that system within you. If you believe this is just overcoming pain so that I can drop those pounds so that I don't have to feel terrible about myself well you won't build that system.

3281
02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:58.000
And this is the beauty in the mystery of the brain which is that the forebrain can draw on all these contextual things you can really give meaning to what would otherwise just be basic limbic experiences.

3282
02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:12.000
There aren't an infinite range of ways to do this. I can't cut myself with this little you know butter knife here and say just kidding because I can't cut myself with this dagger that my fingers barely fill by someone's got some big mitt.

3283
02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:19.000
I can't put it through my hand until myself I didn't do that right there are limits to this the laws of physics still apply the laws of physiology still apply.

3284
02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:32.000
But as we learn from the example of the milkshakes or the example about stress positive or negative learnings about stress there is a range of physiology that we can experience according to something.

3285
02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:44.000
I think this has important implications to for things like PTSD interpreting the experiences of past just telling oneself it wasn't that big of a deal won't work but telling oneself that there's no way to come back from that.

3286
02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:56.000
Also is not true. There's a couple of things that I've been I've been talking about for a while the one I'm going to start with is this idea I've been telling people for a while hey listen.

3287
02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:07.000
Yeah got tendencies so we all have different tendencies you might have a tendency let's say from a leadership perspective that you're a micromanager and you've got to be aware of that tendency because if you don't.

3288
02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:20.000
If you're not aware of it and you don't try and counter it you're going to always end up micromanaging maybe you have a a tendency to be hyper aggressive and you're too aggressive and you go and make you try to run to the sound of the guns without really taking a step back.

3289
02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:34.000
So you have to understand what your tendencies are and then you've got to say my tendency also might be right so now I'm thinking about this from and I also say hey listen as a leader.

3290
02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:46.000
I'm not watching the crowd and you've got to pay attention to make sure that the crowd is going in the right direction when the crowd starts to get fired up about something like yeah we need to go assault that building we need to go assault that building.

3291
02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:55.000
You should say to yourself you should think to yourself the contrary you should think okay wait a second is that the right thing to do right now because it's really easy to get caught up in the crowd.

3292
02:56:55.000 --> 02:57:06.000
I'm noticing a similar thing with our limbic system like there's a chance that your limbic system is correct. Absolutely. But you need to be aware of the tendency of your limbic system and make sure that what that freaking.

3293
02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:20.000
Little tiny part of your animal brain is thinking you need to put it in check and sometimes you go yep it's the right thing to do right now I should get aggressive I should go on the attack but you need to run it through that check first.

3294
02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:40.000
What you're talking about milkshakes and what you're attitude is this is just so clear when you you know from a leadership perspective if we get told hey we got to go freaking do this this mission and it's going to be a real you know a real tough mission it's going to be a weather is horrible.

3295
02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:50.000
And that's how you bring it to the boys hey guys we got to ask for this mission it's going to be freaking horrible the weather is going to be bad we're going to be freezing if that's how you bring it to the boys that that's going to be the attitude all day long.

3296
02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:58.000
If you come down and you say hey listen check this out there's a mission coming down it looks like the looks like a very tough situation.

3297
02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:08.000
They know that we're the only ones that can probably be able to get this done we're going to have this opportunity to go out there and get this get this mission done it's going to be hard but it's going to have a big impact.

3298
02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:20.000
Attitude to 180 out right so we have so much control just by what we're thinking and then if you're in a leadership position the way you present things.

3299
02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:24.000
It's going to it's going to sway the way people think now I'll also tell you this.

3300
02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:40.000
You get told to do something horrible and you truly believe it's horrible and you go down to hey guys this is going to be if you basically lie to them.

3301
02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:53.000
What's the the secret of the secret book right that's where it's like hey it's all coming it's very hard to fool someone into that but if you believe hey this is what we're doing this is huge opportunity this can be a tough mission but it's going to be worthwhile if that's what you believe.

3302
02:58:53.000 --> 02:59:12.000
You know, I don't know when I heard this but this impacted my whole my whole thoughts on war.

3303
02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:22.000
I want to say it might have been Bob dole you know Bob dole was a World War II guy who's wounded you know he never had.

3304
02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:33.000
I think one of his hands didn't work very well but I remember hearing him say and I'm pretty sure was him please don't I'm sorry if I'm getting something getting this wrong but.

3305
02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:40.000
He said simply put he said war made me better.

3306
02:59:40.000 --> 03:00:04.000
And that is the one 80 out of what a lot of guys get told right now war is going to make you crazy it's going to make you depressed it's going to make you an adrenaline junkly won't be any way to satisfy and guys hear that and you're going to have a hard time adjusting and we're going to have to try and assimilate you back into society because it's going to be so hard because of what you see where is Bob dole or whoever this veteran wants to like a war is going to make me better and I always.

3307
03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:17.000
I've used that myself I've used that when people have said to me why no do you feel was it hard for you to say when you look back and you've seen you've lost friends is it no all that stuff look it was horrible.

3308
03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:20.000
But my perspective is better.

3309
03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:30.000
I I appreciate life more because I know that life can be lost very easily I appreciate freedom more because I know the price that was paid for it didn't make me worse actually made me better.

3310
03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:39.000
So I think we have to be careful of that kind of thing and you you can also then go down the whole road of like a social contagion where you've got people reinforcing.

3311
03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:56.000
Behaviors or reinforcing mindsets and it starts to spread we're now everybody's thinking well you know if you into war you must be messed up and I think I want to why I guess I must be messed up because that's what that's what we're doing and this goes across the board with you know you mentioned the one guy earlier that was.

3312
03:00:56.000 --> 03:01:02.000
Cutting the bottom of his feet right and you hear these horrible stories that's a social contagion where.

3313
03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:10.000
These outbreaks of of girls primarily girls you know 12 to 16 years old.

3314
03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:19.000
Would be cutting themselves and it's something that would oh that's what we're doing it's kind of this these things would spread and you know we talked about I want to wear other podcasts.

3315
03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:25.000
I think it was believe believe me right that started a guy wrote an article about it there had been some.

3316
03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:28.000
been some small number of cases ever.

3317
03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:31.000
Oh right I heard about this a little while and then.

3318
03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:38.000
He he wrote an article about it and this is I want to say in the 70s maybe and all of a sudden they have.

3319
03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:47.000
Tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of cases because people said oh they they get this idea and look it is a real thing and then he was reporting or.

3320
03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:57.000
You know documenting people this really happened to but once people got that idea was like oh that's what we're doing and you see this with a lot of.

3321
03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:01.000
A lot of strange things that are spreading right now in in in America and worldwide where you go hey that's.

3322
03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:08.000
That didn't that wasn't a thing not too long ago right that wasn't the thing not too long ago and now it is.

3323
03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:19.000
The number of people breaking up with the number of people we know are that that's not a thing and there are.

3324
03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:22.000
A couple of reflections some that pertains specifically the seal teams but.

3325
03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.000
What you're referring to is the fact that nervous systems are profoundly impacting each other so your example of.

3326
03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:30.000
The group is getting really ramped up we want to fight let's go you know swift while in action now and you're stepping back as the leader and saying wait.

3327
03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:34.000
You're effectively acting as the for brain group that's effectively acting as a limb.

3328
03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:38.96
So, and so, nervous systems can be studied in isolation or in groups.

3329
03:02:38.96 --> 03:02:42.44
It's harder to do that in the laboratory, although there are people there starting to put

3330
03:02:42.44 --> 03:02:45.96
two people into a scanner and having them interact and seeing how the brain areas interact.

3331
03:02:45.96 --> 03:02:49.76
It's harder to do for obvious reasons.

3332
03:02:49.76 --> 03:02:56.48
Ali Krum's group actually did a study which simply asked, do you think stress harms you

3333
03:02:56.48 --> 03:03:01.64
or grows you and measured physiology, cortisol, etc.

3334
03:03:01.64 --> 03:03:07.88
And there was only one group that across the board answered stress grows you and it was

3335
03:03:07.88 --> 03:03:08.88
seals.

3336
03:03:08.88 --> 03:03:12.88
So she's done work on military communities and she's done work on civilians and that's

3337
03:03:12.88 --> 03:03:14.96
a published paper you can find it on her website.

3338
03:03:14.96 --> 03:03:19.52
She runs our Mind Body Lab at Stanford, really a brilliant person who, I think it's the

3339
03:03:19.52 --> 03:03:25.96
experience that resimbed listed off all her credentials or some of her credentials of athlete,

3340
03:03:25.96 --> 03:03:26.96
etc.

3341
03:03:26.96 --> 03:03:31.12
It understands the Mind Body relationship for a first person experience, not just a geek

3342
03:03:31.12 --> 03:03:35.44
and a lab, it's not geek at all actually, but very, very smart.

3343
03:03:35.44 --> 03:03:42.08
The other thing is that it's a notion of social contagion and we are profoundly influenced

3344
03:03:42.08 --> 03:03:46.48
by sensory experience and one of the most intense sensory experiences or the words and actions

3345
03:03:46.48 --> 03:03:47.48
of others.

3346
03:03:47.48 --> 03:03:54.60
Some people are drawn more toward or are shifted more by other people's emotional states.

3347
03:03:54.60 --> 03:04:01.32
We sometimes hold up empathy as this ideal, but empathy is very dangerous because empathy

3348
03:04:01.32 --> 03:04:06.68
for the wrong in the wrong context, you're kid freaking out about an experience at school.

3349
03:04:06.68 --> 03:04:10.36
If you freak out, if you experience true empathy, you abandon your own emotional state,

3350
03:04:10.36 --> 03:04:13.96
but that's not effective parenting or effective leadership.

3351
03:04:13.96 --> 03:04:21.36
So empathy is wonderful only and so far as it allows us to go in understand and then return

3352
03:04:21.36 --> 03:04:24.000
to the context and make better decisions.

3353
03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:30.32
That's a complicated set of neural operations, but again, it all has to do with a confidence

3354
03:04:30.32 --> 03:04:37.40
and a inability to leave your own emotional state going and be comfortable that you can

3355
03:04:37.40 --> 03:04:38.92
get back out.

3356
03:04:38.92 --> 03:04:43.12
So empathy is a double-sided blade, really.

3357
03:04:43.12 --> 03:04:49.40
Interestingly, I'll have the idea of empathy raised with me a lot through leadership.

3358
03:04:49.40 --> 03:04:54.28
You know, isn't it important to be empathetic and I've always made a distinction between,

3359
03:04:54.28 --> 03:04:59.92
well, what I really want to do is I want to be better at understanding what your perspective is.

3360
03:04:59.92 --> 03:05:05.04
So I want to truly understand what your perspective is, but I don't really want to actually

3361
03:05:05.04 --> 03:05:08.32
feel what you're feeling because now I've, I might have messed up what I'm trying to,

3362
03:05:08.32 --> 03:05:14.40
what my perspective is and by the way, I want to get as many different perspectives

3363
03:05:14.40 --> 03:05:18.76
as I can so that I can fully see the problem and understand it from the maximum number

3364
03:05:18.76 --> 03:05:21.24
of angles so now I can most easily find a solution.

3365
03:05:21.24 --> 03:05:26.96
Whereas if I dive in to just looking, it feeling the way you're feeling, that's not good.

3366
03:05:26.96 --> 03:05:30.04
So, you can both drown and you know, you can both drown.

3367
03:05:30.04 --> 03:05:32.60
It's the jumping into the river to save somebody and you can both drown.

3368
03:05:32.60 --> 03:05:36.20
I like this notion of perspective because inability to see throughout the lens of other

3369
03:05:36.20 --> 03:05:41.04
people is extremely important, obviously, but the ability to return to one's own internal

3370
03:05:41.04 --> 03:05:48.32
state is obviously that the one of the hallmarks of great leadership, as you know, the

3371
03:05:48.32 --> 03:05:55.68
idea of groups and how bad things spread between groups is that there's, this will explain

3372
03:05:55.68 --> 03:05:59.76
a lot of what we see on social media and then the press, there was a set of controversial

3373
03:05:59.76 --> 03:06:03.16
but nonetheless important experiments done in the 1960s by a guy named Robert Heath.

3374
03:06:03.16 --> 03:06:06.76
So, that time when you could sign up for an experiment, have electrodes put into your head

3375
03:06:06.76 --> 03:06:11.20
and you could, for a nominal amount of money, you could stimulate the electrodes located

3376
03:06:11.20 --> 03:06:14.52
at different locations and tell Dr. Robert Heath what you're experiencing.

3377
03:06:14.52 --> 03:06:18.28
This is three papers, some of which were published in the journal Science, which is one of our

3378
03:06:18.28 --> 03:06:19.28
kind of Super Bowl.

3379
03:06:19.28 --> 03:06:23.56
We have the Super Bowl NBA Championship and you know, Stanley Cup of Science and they are

3380
03:06:23.56 --> 03:06:25.16
nature science and cell.

3381
03:06:25.16 --> 03:06:27.80
Those are the three top journals, Science is a very good journal.

3382
03:06:27.80 --> 03:06:32.20
He published this paper basically subjects were allowed to stimulate a variety of different

3383
03:06:32.20 --> 03:06:33.88
areas of their brain in their own brain.

3384
03:06:33.88 --> 03:06:34.88
In their own brain.

3385
03:06:34.88 --> 03:06:35.88
Okay.

3386
03:06:35.88 --> 03:06:37.80
Stimulate one area and the person that he'd say, what do you feel?

3387
03:06:37.80 --> 03:06:42.000
They'd say, a little drunk, stimulate another area, what do you feel?

3388
03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:45.08
Kind of giddy, what do you feel a little bit of anger, et cetera?

3389
03:06:45.08 --> 03:06:48.48
And then he would just tell people, you can stimulate an area that you want but you have

3390
03:06:48.48 --> 03:06:49.48
only ten minutes to do it.

3391
03:06:49.48 --> 03:06:53.80
So, they'd play around on the keyboards to, again, come to this experiment now but really

3392
03:06:53.80 --> 03:06:56.08
cool experiment.

3393
03:06:56.08 --> 03:07:02.28
The area that all the subjects chose to stimulate the most far more, more, excuse me than

3394
03:07:02.28 --> 03:07:08.08
other areas is an area of the midline columnist for what it's worth and the subjective

3395
03:07:08.08 --> 03:07:13.56
experience that they all reported, mild frustration and anger.

3396
03:07:13.56 --> 03:07:15.56
You know what this going on here?

3397
03:07:15.56 --> 03:07:18.56
Why would human beings want to feel frustration and anger?

3398
03:07:18.56 --> 03:07:24.48
Well, it turns out that this medial thalamus area is linked up with the dopamine system.

3399
03:07:24.48 --> 03:07:30.88
We may not like limbic friction of the sort like overcoming fatigue to go exercise or

3400
03:07:30.88 --> 03:07:36.56
stress and needing to calm down but human beings seem to love the feeling of being pissed off

3401
03:07:36.56 --> 03:07:38.28
just a little bit.

3402
03:07:38.28 --> 03:07:40.64
And I mentioned this not because I like this result.

3403
03:07:40.64 --> 03:07:44.84
I kind of hate this result but I guess that just speaks to the result itself which is that

3404
03:07:44.84 --> 03:07:47.64
there's something about it which feels motivating.

3405
03:07:47.64 --> 03:07:54.40
Anger feels good at a low level because it puts us into a state of activation and we

3406
03:07:54.40 --> 03:07:57.84
like states of activation and relaxation and guess what?

3407
03:07:57.84 --> 03:08:01.36
It puts us in a state of activation without us having to do anything.

3408
03:08:01.36 --> 03:08:03.60
We're right back where we were before.

3409
03:08:03.60 --> 03:08:06.44
Dopamine hits without any effort.

3410
03:08:06.44 --> 03:08:11.48
Being angry is a dopamine hit without having to do anything and people will sit there all

3411
03:08:11.48 --> 03:08:16.96
day and I confess their times, no one's ever put a negative comment on our comments

3412
03:08:16.96 --> 03:08:18.96
in my Instagram.

3413
03:08:18.96 --> 03:08:20.76
And you want, why do we orient to those?

3414
03:08:20.76 --> 03:08:22.16
Well, we could say, oh, it hurts.

3415
03:08:22.16 --> 03:08:28.40
Actually, frankly, unless it's something I really need to pay attention, I don't really care

3416
03:08:28.40 --> 03:08:33.88
because typically there of a nature that's not really meaningful that doesn't come from

3417
03:08:33.88 --> 03:08:36.68
a place of understanding or, you know, I don't like misunderstandings.

3418
03:08:36.68 --> 03:08:40.56
I do read comments but you want people to understand things but when people are just

3419
03:08:40.56 --> 03:08:46.84
mean spirited, we'll find ourselves orienting towards those because being a little angry turns

3420
03:08:46.84 --> 03:08:48.56
out to be a dopamine hit.

3421
03:08:48.56 --> 03:08:53.52
And I've become very conscious of this because I think social media is a place where we

3422
03:08:53.52 --> 03:09:00.52
can all get drawn down these paths where you can spend all day in a battle in your head

3423
03:09:00.52 --> 03:09:04.64
that doesn't mean anything or worse you can respond to things in a way that can sink

3424
03:09:04.64 --> 03:09:05.64
your whole career.

3425
03:09:05.64 --> 03:09:06.64
You see this?

3426
03:09:06.64 --> 03:09:13.76
I mean, the chair of the psychiatry department at Columbia University was fired for a tweet

3427
03:09:13.76 --> 03:09:15.84
that was just a very insensitive tweet.

3428
03:09:15.84 --> 03:09:21.84
It wasn't an anger-based tweet but that just tells me there was a picture of a model and

3429
03:09:21.84 --> 03:09:25.56
he made a very insensitive remark about her genetic lineage.

3430
03:09:25.56 --> 03:09:27.04
I just don't even want to read it.

3431
03:09:27.04 --> 03:09:28.56
I don't want to restate it because it was-

3432
03:09:28.56 --> 03:09:29.56
How long ago was this?

3433
03:09:29.56 --> 03:09:32.84
So there's recently people who can Google it.

3434
03:09:32.84 --> 03:09:36.36
I don't know what went through his mind but here's what I know.

3435
03:09:36.36 --> 03:09:39.16
It's just a psychiatrist.

3436
03:09:39.16 --> 03:09:44.24
He's one of the leading psychiatrists in the world and he couldn't think to steps ahead

3437
03:09:44.24 --> 03:09:45.48
for whatever reason.

3438
03:09:45.48 --> 03:09:51.16
You know, it's interesting we've been giving a hard time to Instagram a bunch today but

3439
03:09:51.16 --> 03:09:52.48
now you start talking about.

3440
03:09:52.48 --> 03:09:58.08
Now we're talking about Twitter because it is crazy.

3441
03:09:58.08 --> 03:10:05.68
There's people that are you can see it when you read through what they're writing.

3442
03:10:05.68 --> 03:10:08.16
They are feeling legitimate.

3443
03:10:08.16 --> 03:10:09.16
Angle.

3444
03:10:09.16 --> 03:10:10.16
I'm like you.

3445
03:10:10.16 --> 03:10:11.88
I'll read something like, oh, it's kind of funny.

3446
03:10:11.88 --> 03:10:12.88
What are you doing?

3447
03:10:12.88 --> 03:10:13.88
Even when people are saying-

3448
03:10:13.88 --> 03:10:14.88
Yeah, the person feels powerless.

3449
03:10:14.88 --> 03:10:15.88
I can see it.

3450
03:10:15.88 --> 03:10:19.76
I see their common and I go, gosh, they must really feel powerless in this world and I feel

3451
03:10:19.76 --> 03:10:23.40
sad for them but they are pissed.

3452
03:10:23.40 --> 03:10:28.52
So they're getting a little dopamine hit by creating just friction and mayhem and I think

3453
03:10:28.52 --> 03:10:29.72
a lot of people show up.

3454
03:10:29.72 --> 03:10:34.04
I hate to demonize Twitter but I have to say Instagram's a pretty kind place on average.

3455
03:10:34.04 --> 03:10:38.44
I think there is a certain category of people that show up to Twitter to experience that

3456
03:10:38.44 --> 03:10:39.56
form of dopamine hit.

3457
03:10:39.56 --> 03:10:40.72
They are there to fight.

3458
03:10:40.72 --> 03:10:42.72
But they're not there to fight outright.

3459
03:10:42.72 --> 03:10:44.32
They're not going to meet you in the parking lot.

3460
03:10:44.32 --> 03:10:46.76
They're not going to go toe to toe on a data point.

3461
03:10:46.76 --> 03:10:51.04
They'd rather go through and kind of find little misunderstandings and then hijack misunderstanding

3462
03:10:51.04 --> 03:10:54.32
to try and elevate their status within this so-called fight.

3463
03:10:54.32 --> 03:11:00.000
And if you think about the range of meaningless circular career and life diminishing behaviors,

3464
03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:02.40
this would be at the near the top of the list.

3465
03:11:02.40 --> 03:11:07.96
This is like the poor guy in the parking lot who's organizing leaves in the corner and

3466
03:11:07.96 --> 03:11:09.56
you go, he's lost his mind.

3467
03:11:09.56 --> 03:11:10.56
It's really sad.

3468
03:11:10.56 --> 03:11:14.40
Except these are people who arguably still have a mind to reach out.

3469
03:11:14.40 --> 03:11:18.40
So this is, you know, arguably.

3470
03:11:18.40 --> 03:11:23.48
So when I saw those Robert Keith results, I thought, gosh, people don't like to be angry.

3471
03:11:23.48 --> 03:11:29.44
People don't like to be pissed off and yet that low level anger and frustration has direct

3472
03:11:29.44 --> 03:11:31.24
links to the reward pathway.

3473
03:11:31.24 --> 03:11:35.72
And I think we would all be wise to know when we're drifting toward that because we are

3474
03:11:35.72 --> 03:11:39.000
all Kate, if listen, if this circuitry exists and us, we're all capable of it.

3475
03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:41.76
I believe the Carl Jung State minimum though, I'm not a psychologist.

3476
03:11:41.76 --> 03:11:43.72
We have all things inside of us.

3477
03:11:43.72 --> 03:11:49.000
Well, it's also, I'm sitting here painting myself with very guilty because if you think

3478
03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:54.88
about listening to hardcore music, this is, this is music that is fueled by anger and

3479
03:11:54.88 --> 03:11:58.28
fuels anger and it feels good.

3480
03:11:58.28 --> 03:12:05.80
Like the first time I ever heard like the crow mags, I was like, oh, I, this is what I want

3481
03:12:05.80 --> 03:12:06.80
to listen to now.

3482
03:12:06.80 --> 03:12:07.80
Like this is it.

3483
03:12:07.80 --> 03:12:10.80
You know, the first time you hear a gnaz to front, you're like, okay, this is what I want

3484
03:12:10.80 --> 03:12:13.40
to listen to now because you get that little, you get that hit.

3485
03:12:13.40 --> 03:12:16.000
So that got me hook line and sink or man.

3486
03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:18.16
But you channeled it into something.

3487
03:12:18.16 --> 03:12:21.32
So that's anger and dopamine without effort.

3488
03:12:21.32 --> 03:12:24.64
But then you took that and you applied it to something.

3489
03:12:24.64 --> 03:12:26.48
You listened to it while you train.

3490
03:12:26.48 --> 03:12:28.60
You orient towards a mindset.

3491
03:12:28.60 --> 03:12:33.12
You know, the examples are very nuanced and particular to ourselves.

3492
03:12:33.12 --> 03:12:36.64
So they're not even worth sharing, but they're songs and things in my head that I hear

3493
03:12:36.64 --> 03:12:39.52
that allow me to show up a better person.

3494
03:12:39.52 --> 03:12:44.76
And I'm actually not the first to discuss as the great neurologist Oliver Sachs wrote about

3495
03:12:44.76 --> 03:12:48.68
this, you know, he wrote the book of Wake and Innings and he wrote the menu, Mr. Kizwai

3496
03:12:48.68 --> 03:12:49.68
for Had.

3497
03:12:49.68 --> 03:12:54.16
It was looked at clinical abnormalities and taught people about how the brain works and

3498
03:12:54.16 --> 03:12:56.52
based on how it breaks in these beautiful books.

3499
03:12:56.52 --> 03:13:01.28
But he was also held the California State Record for Back Squat.

3500
03:13:01.28 --> 03:13:02.28
Respect.

3501
03:13:02.28 --> 03:13:03.28
They all know about these books.

3502
03:13:03.28 --> 03:13:04.28
You're talking about whatever.

3503
03:13:04.28 --> 03:13:08.28
I don't know about these psychological things you're saying, but record him back squat.

3504
03:13:08.28 --> 03:13:09.28
Exactly.

3505
03:13:09.28 --> 03:13:13.32
Yeah, this is a guy who was serious about his physical training.

3506
03:13:13.32 --> 03:13:14.32
He talked about this.

3507
03:13:14.32 --> 03:13:20.000
He talked about anchoring to emotional states through, for him, listening to classical music,

3508
03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:23.08
then being able to access creative works of writing.

3509
03:13:23.08 --> 03:13:26.80
Being able to listen to angry, he talked even about things that evoke anger and then

3510
03:13:26.80 --> 03:13:30.80
being able to take that anger and bring that to his ability to work very long hours

3511
03:13:30.80 --> 03:13:35.56
in the clinic to help people that were on words of hospitals that no one would dare go

3512
03:13:35.56 --> 03:13:37.64
down, let alone go in there and help these people.

3513
03:13:37.64 --> 03:13:42.40
These are just imagine the worst place to ever be placed as a Parkinson's patient or an

3514
03:13:42.40 --> 03:13:43.40
Alzheimer's.

3515
03:13:43.40 --> 03:13:47.88
These are torture chambers that he would go into and he would take people out of the hospital.

3516
03:13:47.88 --> 03:13:50.36
He did incredible humanitarian works.

3517
03:13:50.36 --> 03:13:56.40
He talked about channeling these reflexive tendencies toward good and toward building a career

3518
03:13:56.40 --> 03:13:57.40
in a life.

3519
03:13:57.40 --> 03:14:01.60
I think listening to the chromaags, if you can put you put that into something useful,

3520
03:14:01.60 --> 03:14:04.28
just sitting there in your room and just listening to over and over endlessly and not

3521
03:14:04.28 --> 03:14:08.76
leaving to be angry at the world or looking at what the Columbine kids did, just pissed off

3522
03:14:08.76 --> 03:14:15.08
at everybody and then going and just hosing a cafeteria with bullets, well, obviously,

3523
03:14:15.08 --> 03:14:16.68
it can go either way.

3524
03:14:16.68 --> 03:14:20.12
I think that learning to harness these more primitive states is very useful.

3525
03:14:20.12 --> 03:14:22.20
We can't eliminate these states.

3526
03:14:22.20 --> 03:14:27.72
We can't pretend they don't exist, but you can funnel them into real, not just benevolent,

3527
03:14:27.72 --> 03:14:32.36
but really human species growing actions.

3528
03:14:32.36 --> 03:14:36.52
I think this is another just to bring up this word awareness again.

3529
03:14:36.52 --> 03:14:41.72
We got some awareness now of the dopamine and what that crash is going to feel like.

3530
03:14:41.72 --> 03:14:46.04
Now we can start to put that into the calculus of how we're behaving.

3531
03:14:46.04 --> 03:14:50.62
We're talking about the limbic system and understanding and being aware of what the limbic

3532
03:14:50.62 --> 03:14:54.12
system is trying to do and that it may or may not be leading you in the right direction,

3533
03:14:54.12 --> 03:15:01.84
but you need to use your own brain to put that thing in check and either go with it or say,

3534
03:15:01.84 --> 03:15:03.52
no, not right now.

3535
03:15:03.52 --> 03:15:07.52
So these things to become aware of these things, very important.

3536
03:15:07.52 --> 03:15:14.20
And what you said, this kind of thing has only been around for a limited amount of time.

3537
03:15:14.20 --> 03:15:18.40
For most of human history, it's been happening.

3538
03:15:18.40 --> 03:15:22.64
Yeah, well, the effort to get the dopamine reward has been there.

3539
03:15:22.64 --> 03:15:26.76
There was a time in which violent battle was adaptive and there still times where violent

3540
03:15:26.76 --> 03:15:30.96
battle was adaptive and then there are times when it'll completely sink your life.

3541
03:15:30.96 --> 03:15:36.44
I mean, I think that we're in a very important time right now where we can trigger activation

3542
03:15:36.44 --> 03:15:39.24
of all these neural circuitrys sitting at home.

3543
03:15:39.24 --> 03:15:41.48
We don't even have to get out of bed.

3544
03:15:41.48 --> 03:15:46.92
But we see, I think the explosion of mental illness, the explosion of anxiety and depression

3545
03:15:46.92 --> 03:15:56.12
in ADHD is absolutely the consequence of ready availability of pleasures without effort.

3546
03:15:56.12 --> 03:15:59.76
Lack of understanding about how our own basic physiology works.

3547
03:15:59.76 --> 03:16:03.76
I have great respect for the fields of psychology, great respect.

3548
03:16:03.76 --> 03:16:10.40
But thinking about your thinking is useful, but knowing that you can put a wedge in between

3549
03:16:10.40 --> 03:16:16.36
your thinking and your physiology is also useful, not better, but also useful.

3550
03:16:16.36 --> 03:16:20.36
And so for instance, if you're somebody who suffers from anxiety, practice physiological

3551
03:16:20.36 --> 03:16:24.52
size, long exales, if you're somebody who feels a motivated, think about how much pleasure

3552
03:16:24.52 --> 03:16:30.52
you're, or sensory stuff and food and stuff you're consuming without effort first, start

3553
03:16:30.52 --> 03:16:37.72
to embrace this idea that effort followed by reward, repeat, effort, reward, repeat is not

3554
03:16:37.72 --> 03:16:39.32
just something that I'm saying.

3555
03:16:39.32 --> 03:16:43.96
It's been the signature pattern of life progression and individuals.

3556
03:16:43.96 --> 03:16:49.84
It's been the signature pattern of the evolution of our species that was 2,000 years ago.

3557
03:16:49.84 --> 03:16:53.04
That's true today and it's likely going to be true 1,000 years from now.

3558
03:16:53.04 --> 03:16:56.36
I mean, I love the idea that companies like Neural Lincoln, Stuffer, can develop little devices.

3559
03:16:56.36 --> 03:16:58.72
You just trigger your motivation circuitry, but guess what?

3560
03:16:58.72 --> 03:17:01.60
Dopamine is a non-infinite but renewable resource.

3561
03:17:01.60 --> 03:17:06.36
If you just dump all your dopamine because you stimulate with an electrode, you know this

3562
03:17:06.36 --> 03:17:07.36
from experiments in the lab.

3563
03:17:07.36 --> 03:17:09.20
You keep triggering those brain areas.

3564
03:17:09.20 --> 03:17:12.16
You're not going to be a motivated person 24 hours a day.

3565
03:17:12.16 --> 03:17:13.64
You're just going to deplete all your dopamine.

3566
03:17:13.64 --> 03:17:19.40
So unless they have a plan to also put dopamine back in the system, there's no neurotechnologies

3567
03:17:19.40 --> 03:17:24.36
that are going to overcome the technology of the brain completely.

3568
03:17:24.36 --> 03:17:26.20
You can augment it, but you're not going to overcome it.

3569
03:17:26.20 --> 03:17:30.20
You're not going to build a cyborg warrior that completely discards with the human element

3570
03:17:30.20 --> 03:17:35.52
because everything that you've talked about in terms of leadership and self-control, all

3571
03:17:35.52 --> 03:17:39.48
these four brain circuits, and I've been describing the four brain as one thing, like a

3572
03:17:39.48 --> 03:17:40.76
break on the limbic system.

3573
03:17:40.76 --> 03:17:42.92
We're an accelerator on the limbic system.

3574
03:17:42.92 --> 03:17:45.000
But it's really like spinning multiple plates.

3575
03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:49.56
The ability to use your four brain, it feels hard, feels like effort even if you're just

3576
03:17:49.56 --> 03:17:53.84
sitting in a chair because you have to spin a plate over here and then you have to spin

3577
03:17:53.84 --> 03:17:54.84
a plate over.

3578
03:17:54.84 --> 03:17:56.12
You have to think, okay, those guys are going to go there.

3579
03:17:56.12 --> 03:17:57.12
Then they're going to arrive at this time.

3580
03:17:57.12 --> 03:17:58.12
Then I'm going to arrive at this time.

3581
03:17:58.12 --> 03:18:01.32
A lot of people just go, ah, they were like overwhelmed.

3582
03:18:01.32 --> 03:18:06.12
You have to calm yourself as you know and think, okay, then when they arrive and this, I mean,

3583
03:18:06.12 --> 03:18:07.76
what are these plates that's been giving me a little bit?

3584
03:18:07.76 --> 03:18:11.000
These are, I think about the four brain circuits as working in parallel.

3585
03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:12.000
You don't have one four brain.

3586
03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:14.28
You have maybe five or six four brain circuits.

3587
03:18:14.28 --> 03:18:18.000
The simple operation would be lifting up this drink to drink it.

3588
03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:23.12
A more complicated thing would be trying to think about doing this every time Echo puts

3589
03:18:23.12 --> 03:18:26.32
his hand on his chin throughout the whole podcast while we're having a conversation.

3590
03:18:26.32 --> 03:18:27.96
Now I have to spin multiple plates.

3591
03:18:27.96 --> 03:18:29.60
I have to keep things going in real time.

3592
03:18:29.60 --> 03:18:32.72
It's a trivial example because it's not important when he does that.

3593
03:18:32.72 --> 03:18:37.80
But it allows me to demonstrate that we can contextualize anything.

3594
03:18:37.80 --> 03:18:42.000
We can say, you know, every time that shadow moves to the left just a little bit, you know,

3595
03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:43.000
did that shadow move?

3596
03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:44.24
I don't know if that shadow moves.

3597
03:18:44.24 --> 03:18:48.08
That's a lot of vigilance, but sure, you can occupy your whole four brain with that,

3598
03:18:48.08 --> 03:18:51.04
or you can do that while paying attention to how many guys are out on the ground or moving

3599
03:18:51.04 --> 03:18:52.04
behind you.

3600
03:18:52.04 --> 03:18:54.32
So the four brain, it goes under high demand.

3601
03:18:54.32 --> 03:19:00.08
When we sleep, we regain the capacity to do that multiple plate spinning type of operation.

3602
03:19:00.08 --> 03:19:06.16
And when you go into non-sleep deep rest, when we turn off that effort, we reinstate that

3603
03:19:06.16 --> 03:19:07.16
effort.

3604
03:19:07.16 --> 03:19:08.56
I'll just mention one experiment.

3605
03:19:08.56 --> 03:19:10.000
There's done out of a lab in Scandinavia.

3606
03:19:10.000 --> 03:19:13.72
They had people just lie down and do a yoga knee to your type, non- or just you could

3607
03:19:13.72 --> 03:19:16.88
go online and do NSDR, just do NSDR made for it.

3608
03:19:16.88 --> 03:19:17.88
It's a free script.

3609
03:19:17.88 --> 03:19:19.88
You can listen to this, do it for 30 minutes.

3610
03:19:19.88 --> 03:19:25.20
They found that when people do that sort of exercise of just deliberate decompression, not

3611
03:19:25.20 --> 03:19:29.88
engaging their four brain, doing long exhales, the amount of dopamine in a brain structure

3612
03:19:29.88 --> 03:19:32.44
called the basal ganglia was replenished.

3613
03:19:32.44 --> 03:19:33.44
That's very important.

3614
03:19:33.44 --> 03:19:39.40
The basal ganglia are involved in directing go actions and no go.

3615
03:19:39.40 --> 03:19:43.12
One way that people can get better controlling their behavior in limbic friction is, I do

3616
03:19:43.12 --> 03:19:44.60
this actually.

3617
03:19:44.60 --> 03:19:49.80
I'm slightly embarrassed but also proud to say 20 times a day, I find myself wanting to do

3618
03:19:49.80 --> 03:19:51.04
something like pick up the phone.

3619
03:19:51.04 --> 03:19:53.80
I've been wanting to pick up that little paper clip and this whole podcast because I like

3620
03:19:53.80 --> 03:19:55.36
it for a reason that I'm interested in.

3621
03:19:55.36 --> 03:19:57.24
Not allowing myself to do it.

3622
03:19:57.24 --> 03:19:59.28
For a reason that they don't are trivial, but what am I doing?

3623
03:19:59.28 --> 03:20:02.72
I'm engaging the no-go pathway.

3624
03:20:02.72 --> 03:20:06.72
So try and learn to overcome limbic friction by forcing yourself to do things that you don't

3625
03:20:06.72 --> 03:20:08.20
want to do.

3626
03:20:08.20 --> 03:20:11.44
Try and force yourself to not do things that you want to do, even trivial things and what

3627
03:20:11.44 --> 03:20:15.12
you're doing is you're building up these little circuitries and the basal ganglia depend

3628
03:20:15.12 --> 03:20:16.12
on dopamine.

3629
03:20:16.12 --> 03:20:19.000
Different receptors for go and no go but dopamine.

3630
03:20:19.000 --> 03:20:21.96
Deep relaxation retours your ability to do this.

3631
03:20:21.96 --> 03:20:24.92
Remember, non-infinite but renewable.

3632
03:20:24.92 --> 03:20:28.80
So the more plate spinning, the more go-no goes you perform throughout the day, the more

3633
03:20:28.80 --> 03:20:30.76
you deplete the circuitry.

3634
03:20:30.76 --> 03:20:34.88
30 minutes of a non-sleep deep rest or a good night sleep, whatever that means for you,

3635
03:20:34.88 --> 03:20:37.72
reinstates those dopamine levels.

3636
03:20:37.72 --> 03:20:42.12
So at the end of the day, we're more than a bag of chemicals but this stuff has been

3637
03:20:42.12 --> 03:20:44.20
baked into us.

3638
03:20:44.20 --> 03:20:45.52
So check this out.

3639
03:20:45.52 --> 03:20:50.56
Something I've been teaching a decent amount lately and it just would be very interesting

3640
03:20:50.56 --> 03:20:53.24
to see how this overlays on your spinning plates.

3641
03:20:53.24 --> 03:20:57.40
So I've been trying to teach people, I got asked a question.

3642
03:20:57.40 --> 03:21:03.52
I was up at an event and at this event, some of my guys that worked for me in the

3643
03:21:03.52 --> 03:21:08.72
SEAL teams were their late-fab and inter-Paul and these guys happened to tell a couple stories

3644
03:21:08.72 --> 03:21:11.92
where like, oh, you know, Jocco did this.

3645
03:21:11.92 --> 03:21:15.36
He made this decision right here and it was great and then you know, Andrew got up and say,

3646
03:21:15.36 --> 03:21:17.000
oh, this other time, Jocco made.

3647
03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:21.52
And so they painted me in a great light, maybe look really cool and you know, I was kind

3648
03:21:21.52 --> 03:21:26.000
of, you know, my ego is inflating and then during one of the breaks, a couple of guys that

3649
03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:27.000
were there.

3650
03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:28.000
These are business guys.

3651
03:21:28.000 --> 03:21:32.56
They come up and you know, you know, you have just such great instincts.

3652
03:21:32.56 --> 03:21:36.000
So obvious, you know, as a leader that you just have these great instincts and I was kind

3653
03:21:36.000 --> 03:21:40.32
of like, yeah, you know, it's pretty, I'm really, I'm really good instincts and they kind

3654
03:21:40.32 --> 03:21:43.28
of inflated my ego and I felt great about myself.

3655
03:21:43.28 --> 03:21:48.20
And then I went back, we were out the woods and I went back to my little cabin and I started

3656
03:21:48.20 --> 03:21:51.000
thinking myself, let me second.

3657
03:21:51.000 --> 03:21:57.72
First of all, if the only thing I have is good leadership instincts and I'm just a good

3658
03:21:57.72 --> 03:22:02.48
natural leader and that's what I have, what good is it to me to be able to talk to anyone

3659
03:22:02.48 --> 03:22:05.72
else about it, if it's just something that I naturally have that no one else can have.

3660
03:22:05.72 --> 03:22:06.72
That doesn't make any sense.

3661
03:22:06.72 --> 03:22:10.28
And I said, and by the way, I know for a fact, I didn't always have these things.

3662
03:22:10.28 --> 03:22:14.20
So then I started thinking about, well, how do I actually make decisions when I've got

3663
03:22:14.20 --> 03:22:16.12
a bunch of chaotic things going on?

3664
03:22:16.12 --> 03:22:21.40
And I sat down and I wrote down what I do in my brain when things are happening, when things

3665
03:22:21.40 --> 03:22:27.20
are going on, when there's an enemy contact, when there's a problem out on the battlefield,

3666
03:22:27.20 --> 03:22:28.48
or when does a business problem?

3667
03:22:28.48 --> 03:22:29.80
What am I doing?

3668
03:22:29.80 --> 03:22:33.80
And I wrote down sort of these things that I think about.

3669
03:22:33.80 --> 03:22:40.04
And I ended up saying, hey, this is where we went back later that night and I said, hey,

3670
03:22:40.04 --> 03:22:42.24
you guys asked me this question to ask me about my instinct.

3671
03:22:42.24 --> 03:22:43.76
Well, let me tell you it's not instinct.

3672
03:22:43.76 --> 03:22:49.96
I am running a loop in my head to check that I am going in the right direction.

3673
03:22:49.96 --> 03:22:52.52
Number one thing I always think about is time.

3674
03:22:52.52 --> 03:22:53.76
How much time do I have right now?

3675
03:22:53.76 --> 03:22:55.92
Something's going on and I have to make a decision.

3676
03:22:55.92 --> 03:22:57.32
Do I have 20 minutes to make that decision?

3677
03:22:57.32 --> 03:22:58.32
Do I have three minutes to make?

3678
03:22:58.32 --> 03:23:00.12
Do I have to make a decision right now?

3679
03:23:00.12 --> 03:23:03.92
I think about the fundamental laws of combat that we talk about all the time.

3680
03:23:03.92 --> 03:23:07.92
Like, hey, are we going to support each other if I make this decision?

3681
03:23:07.92 --> 03:23:11.52
Is it going to help us as a team if I make this decision?

3682
03:23:11.52 --> 03:23:14.20
Oh, and by the way, can I communicate it simply?

3683
03:23:14.20 --> 03:23:15.92
Okay, if I can communicate it simply great.

3684
03:23:15.92 --> 03:23:18.76
Hey, where does this fall on our priority list?

3685
03:23:18.76 --> 03:23:19.76
What number priorities?

3686
03:23:19.76 --> 03:23:21.92
Is this a higher priority than what we've been doing?

3687
03:23:21.92 --> 03:23:23.04
Do I need to shift priorities?

3688
03:23:23.04 --> 03:23:24.68
Do I need to tell everyone to shift priorities?

3689
03:23:24.68 --> 03:23:27.12
Or does this not fit the top priority?

3690
03:23:27.12 --> 03:23:28.52
Decentralized command.

3691
03:23:28.52 --> 03:23:33.84
Can I get someone, can I delegate this problem to someone else?

3692
03:23:33.84 --> 03:23:37.24
Can I give it to them so that I can then look up and out?

3693
03:23:37.24 --> 03:23:39.68
And I had this, so I went through this list of things.

3694
03:23:39.68 --> 03:23:42.16
Hey, is this part of the mission that we're actually trying to do?

3695
03:23:42.16 --> 03:23:45.56
Because sometimes you're on a mission and you get distracted by something else and all of a sudden

3696
03:23:45.56 --> 03:23:46.80
you get focused on that.

3697
03:23:46.80 --> 03:23:48.68
You can't allow yourself to do that.

3698
03:23:48.68 --> 03:23:52.80
And I had this whole list of things of these thoughts that I will go through.

3699
03:23:52.80 --> 03:23:56.72
And the most important thing as I get done telling, explaining this list of things to people

3700
03:23:56.72 --> 03:24:02.20
was you can't get caught on any one of these things.

3701
03:24:02.20 --> 03:24:08.44
If you get caught on the time factor, you'll never figure out if this is actually part

3702
03:24:08.44 --> 03:24:09.44
of the mission.

3703
03:24:09.44 --> 03:24:12.76
If you only focused on, hey, is this part of our mission, you might run out of time before

3704
03:24:12.76 --> 03:24:14.000
you make an decision.

3705
03:24:14.000 --> 03:24:18.56
So in my mind, when you talk about these spinning plates, I get it.

3706
03:24:18.56 --> 03:24:22.80
And what I realize and when you were talking about looking at a shadow and paying attention

3707
03:24:22.80 --> 03:24:24.24
to it, you do have to pay attention.

3708
03:24:24.24 --> 03:24:28.04
You have to check on it, but you can't forget about everything else that's going on.

3709
03:24:28.04 --> 03:24:34.04
So this is an interesting dynamic when I hear these that my frontal lobe has these spinning

3710
03:24:34.04 --> 03:24:35.28
plates.

3711
03:24:35.28 --> 03:24:41.64
Well, I know that I can't really pay attention to them all at the same time.

3712
03:24:41.64 --> 03:24:45.24
So I have to kind of check this one, give it a little spin, check this one, balance it,

3713
03:24:45.24 --> 03:24:46.48
check this one, balance it.

3714
03:24:46.48 --> 03:24:49.16
And if I get focused on one, another one's going to get dropped.

3715
03:24:49.16 --> 03:24:54.12
So that's what I do is I go through and I look, okay, let me check this.

3716
03:24:54.12 --> 03:24:57.80
Let me check this, let me check this and I keep going around in a circle, in a loop.

3717
03:24:57.80 --> 03:24:59.92
And this can all happen in a half a second.

3718
03:24:59.92 --> 03:25:02.04
You can do all these things over and over again.

3719
03:25:02.04 --> 03:25:05.000
But if you get stuck in one of these things, you're going to fall apart.

3720
03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:08.38
And this goes back to your vertibus eutolope, observe or you're going to side and act

3721
03:25:08.38 --> 03:25:09.84
it's the same thing.

3722
03:25:09.84 --> 03:25:11.64
You have to keep it moving.

3723
03:25:11.64 --> 03:25:16.88
And if you get stuck on trying to decide what to do, if you get, I can't make a decision,

3724
03:25:16.88 --> 03:25:18.36
you're going to fall apart.

3725
03:25:18.36 --> 03:25:22.000
If you get stuck in action, which some people think, oh, that'd be good.

3726
03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:23.000
You're taking action.

3727
03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:27.64
But you're not running the feedback and seeing how this action is affecting everything

3728
03:25:27.64 --> 03:25:29.16
else that's happening around you.

3729
03:25:29.16 --> 03:25:33.08
You have to do the action, then you have to go back and observe how it's impacting the

3730
03:25:33.08 --> 03:25:34.08
scenario.

3731
03:25:34.08 --> 03:25:36.12
And in orient yourself to where you are now.

3732
03:25:36.12 --> 03:25:38.32
And then decide if that was a good action or not.

3733
03:25:38.32 --> 03:25:43.40
So this idea of spinning plates is very interesting to me because they're out there.

3734
03:25:43.40 --> 03:25:46.60
I know that I know that there's times when I have all these plates spinning.

3735
03:25:46.60 --> 03:25:51.96
And I know that if I get focused on one of those spinning plates, I'm going to drop some

3736
03:25:51.96 --> 03:25:54.72
other ones and then everything's going to fall apart.

3737
03:25:54.72 --> 03:26:01.000
Yeah, it's what the examples you provide are really key because first of all, it's

3738
03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:02.56
high demand work.

3739
03:26:02.56 --> 03:26:05.04
You know, one can get comfortable.

3740
03:26:05.04 --> 03:26:07.68
What we're referring to is spinning plates.

3741
03:26:07.68 --> 03:26:10.48
Some people experience overwhelmed trying to do two things.

3742
03:26:10.48 --> 03:26:13.88
We so value this notion of focus and focus is wonderful.

3743
03:26:13.88 --> 03:26:18.08
But we sometimes forget that the brain does not have one in spotlight of focus.

3744
03:26:18.08 --> 03:26:23.24
The way to think about focus is that we are old world primates and we can do something

3745
03:26:23.24 --> 03:26:24.24
called covert attention.

3746
03:26:24.24 --> 03:26:27.32
So I can talk to you, pay attention to you, but I can also pay attention to echo.

3747
03:26:27.32 --> 03:26:29.52
I've got two spotlights.

3748
03:26:29.52 --> 03:26:31.04
I can intensify a spotlight.

3749
03:26:31.04 --> 03:26:35.08
You can start to pay attention to some specific feature of what you're saying or doing.

3750
03:26:35.08 --> 03:26:38.72
And as I do that, he starts to disappear a little bit and then I can switch.

3751
03:26:38.72 --> 03:26:40.60
These are the attentional mechanisms of the forebrain.

3752
03:26:40.60 --> 03:26:44.16
If you want to play that game, I assure you if we put you in a scanner, your prefrontal

3753
03:26:44.16 --> 03:26:49.60
cortex would be lighting up like crazy, meaning high levels of metabolic activity there.

3754
03:26:49.60 --> 03:26:53.88
I can also take those two spotlights and merge them to a single location.

3755
03:26:53.88 --> 03:26:55.20
I can make them more intense.

3756
03:26:55.20 --> 03:26:58.24
I can broaden them and I can make them more diffuse.

3757
03:26:58.24 --> 03:27:00.24
We don't have three spotlights.

3758
03:27:00.24 --> 03:27:02.40
We have two.

3759
03:27:02.40 --> 03:27:03.64
But we don't just have one.

3760
03:27:03.64 --> 03:27:07.44
And so if you understand attention as two spotlights, maybe one that's right there and one

3761
03:27:07.44 --> 03:27:11.88
that's drifting, maybe two that can merge to a specific location.

3762
03:27:11.88 --> 03:27:15.96
Or if you need to, when we talk about spinning multiple plates, what we're talking about

3763
03:27:15.96 --> 03:27:21.96
is toggling back and moving those spotlights and knowing that at one point as you describe

3764
03:27:21.96 --> 03:27:24.76
attention will truly be off some element.

3765
03:27:24.76 --> 03:27:30.96
Which element is off of and what it's on is crucial in high-stakes, high consequences scenarios

3766
03:27:30.96 --> 03:27:34.56
like you described it's vital to survival.

3767
03:27:34.56 --> 03:27:37.84
So we can learn how to do this, however.

3768
03:27:37.84 --> 03:27:43.52
Putting on a sit down and read a book without any distraction, or I actually like to put

3769
03:27:43.52 --> 03:27:46.36
my phone right next to me and do a bunch of no-goes.

3770
03:27:46.36 --> 03:27:50.56
Every time that thing calls me, I just give it a little, oh no, FU.

3771
03:27:50.56 --> 03:27:51.56
No.

3772
03:27:51.56 --> 03:27:55.52
And I, you know, you're practicing the no-go pathway and reading a book.

3773
03:27:55.52 --> 03:27:58.92
The other thing that's very useful for developing focus is something that people don't

3774
03:27:58.92 --> 03:28:03.04
do often enough anymore, including me, which is writing in complete sentences.

3775
03:28:03.04 --> 03:28:07.60
The ability to write and think in complete sentences is hard work.

3776
03:28:07.60 --> 03:28:12.12
I have a colleague at Stanford Carl Diceroth, he no doubt will win a no-go prize, is a psychiatrist

3777
03:28:12.12 --> 03:28:19.28
in a bio-engineer and incredibly successful in science also as five kids practicing clinical

3778
03:28:19.28 --> 03:28:20.28
psychiatrist.

3779
03:28:20.28 --> 03:28:22.96
And I asked him, you know, what is your tool?

3780
03:28:22.96 --> 03:28:24.28
What in the world are you doing?

3781
03:28:24.28 --> 03:28:28.72
And he says, well, at least once every 24 hours, I sit down in a chair and I force myself

3782
03:28:28.72 --> 03:28:35.60
to stay completely motionless and think only in complete sentences for about a half an hour.

3783
03:28:35.60 --> 03:28:39.32
I try doing this for about five minutes, it is really tough.

3784
03:28:39.32 --> 03:28:43.88
I invite anyone to try and only writing complete sentences for five minutes when they

3785
03:28:43.88 --> 03:28:50.000
journal as opposed to, you know, texting, we tend to use, you know, descriptive clauses

3786
03:28:50.000 --> 03:28:54.68
and we tend to do fragments now and we're starting, now the brain thinks in kind of

3787
03:28:54.68 --> 03:28:57.52
fragments and symbols and that's very efficient.

3788
03:28:57.52 --> 03:29:00.04
We wouldn't want to only think in complete sentences.

3789
03:29:00.04 --> 03:29:05.04
But by writing in complete sentences, by forcing that pain over writing or that pain of

3790
03:29:05.04 --> 03:29:11.28
thinking in a structured way, you are building up, you are reinforcing the neural circuits

3791
03:29:11.28 --> 03:29:16.68
that support that so-called spinning of multiple plates, the ability to move the spotlight

3792
03:29:16.68 --> 03:29:17.68
to a single location.

3793
03:29:17.68 --> 03:29:20.80
You're learning at a harness the spotlight at one location.

3794
03:29:20.80 --> 03:29:25.96
And so I think a lot of people don't realize they can train these circuits related to

3795
03:29:25.96 --> 03:29:26.96
attention.

3796
03:29:26.96 --> 03:29:29.84
You might say, well, how could writing complete sentences help me multitask?

3797
03:29:29.84 --> 03:29:30.84
That doesn't make any sense.

3798
03:29:30.84 --> 03:29:34.08
Ah, you're still taking control of these attentional systems.

3799
03:29:34.08 --> 03:29:36.72
It's like learning how to operate any vehicle.

3800
03:29:36.72 --> 03:29:41.12
Of course, it's not going to allow you to operate that vehicle in every context and in

3801
03:29:41.12 --> 03:29:42.80
every way that vehicle could be operated.

3802
03:29:42.80 --> 03:29:46.64
But you're learning the basic mechanics of attention when you force yourself to write

3803
03:29:46.64 --> 03:29:50.52
in complete sentences to think or speak in complete sentences.

3804
03:29:50.52 --> 03:29:52.28
This is why I do the long podcast.

3805
03:29:52.28 --> 03:29:56.24
I do these two and a half hour podcasts by myself and it's hard.

3806
03:29:56.24 --> 03:30:00.76
And I think, this is hard, but I can't just say a half a sentence and then just drop it

3807
03:30:00.76 --> 03:30:03.48
because I know that the rest of what I wanted to say.

3808
03:30:03.48 --> 03:30:05.96
It's work, but it feels good.

3809
03:30:05.96 --> 03:30:10.16
And this is the other element, which is that over time the dopamine system can be woven

3810
03:30:10.16 --> 03:30:12.24
into the systems that control effort.

3811
03:30:12.24 --> 03:30:18.44
I guess the notion of growth mindset is learning to cope, carol-du-ax beautiful work,

3812
03:30:18.44 --> 03:30:22.84
is learning to couple the notion that effort is good for us.

3813
03:30:22.84 --> 03:30:27.000
But neurochemically we can start to experience friction and think, ah, this is growing

3814
03:30:27.000 --> 03:30:28.000
me.

3815
03:30:28.000 --> 03:30:31.000
You know, in any other context, it would be corny, but in this context and because of a

3816
03:30:31.000 --> 03:30:35.96
newly accram study of Navy SEALs, I can appropriately say, learn to think about effort

3817
03:30:35.96 --> 03:30:39.56
like a seal would, which is this is growing me.

3818
03:30:39.56 --> 03:30:44.08
In that thought, you are releasing dopamine in response to effort.

3819
03:30:44.08 --> 03:30:48.76
In other words, the more friction you always say, good, more friction, good.

3820
03:30:48.76 --> 03:30:50.16
I actually think about that a lot.

3821
03:30:50.16 --> 03:30:54.52
I had some trying circumstances recently, an uninteresting forsake of this podcast.

3822
03:30:54.52 --> 03:30:58.56
And I thought, god, this is either going to make or break us and I thought, what if I just

3823
03:30:58.56 --> 03:31:02.36
decided that the more stress now, the better it's going to be?

3824
03:31:02.36 --> 03:31:06.04
It's instantaneous, but then you have to keep doing that.

3825
03:31:06.04 --> 03:31:08.16
When you wake up, sleep deprived, you have to do it again.

3826
03:31:08.16 --> 03:31:09.88
When someone triggers, you have to do it again.

3827
03:31:09.88 --> 03:31:11.60
I love the Udalupe.

3828
03:31:11.60 --> 03:31:15.48
I love that you raised for the first time I heard you, someone raised the Udalupe, not

3829
03:31:15.48 --> 03:31:18.36
as something that's done once, but it's done over and over and over.

3830
03:31:18.36 --> 03:31:21.64
It's Udalupe's plural.

3831
03:31:21.64 --> 03:31:25.32
I think we always hear about it as a unitary thing, but it's Udalupe's like you're in

3832
03:31:25.32 --> 03:31:28.04
observation over here and you're in action on this one.

3833
03:31:28.04 --> 03:31:29.04
It's multiple Udalupe's.

3834
03:31:29.04 --> 03:31:30.04
Yep.

3835
03:31:30.04 --> 03:31:35.56
And by the way, you're running like a tactical low level, real-time short-term Udalupe for

3836
03:31:35.56 --> 03:31:38.70
what I'm going to get out of this right now, but at the same time you're running a bigger

3837
03:31:38.70 --> 03:31:42.72
Udalupe, or you should be a strategic Udalupe that's looking at like, well, how is this

3838
03:31:42.72 --> 03:31:44.92
going to affect me six months from now?

3839
03:31:44.92 --> 03:31:47.24
And then you've got to even bigger one that's going five years.

3840
03:31:47.24 --> 03:31:48.24
That's the actual.

3841
03:31:48.24 --> 03:31:52.92
All these different Udalupe's going on at the same time that you have to be running.

3842
03:31:52.92 --> 03:31:54.48
Forgive me, I didn't mean to interrupt.

3843
03:31:54.48 --> 03:31:55.48
That's the forb.

3844
03:31:55.48 --> 03:31:56.48
I was just too excited.

3845
03:31:56.48 --> 03:31:59.64
I couldn't, I didn't suppress my forb.

3846
03:31:59.64 --> 03:32:04.44
The interrupting is a forb, rain, limbic friction glitch.

3847
03:32:04.44 --> 03:32:05.44
Forgive me.

3848
03:32:05.44 --> 03:32:10.88
That's your forb, rain, accessing the library of past, present, and future.

3849
03:32:10.88 --> 03:32:16.40
You know, this, when you talk about, here's another interesting crossover.

3850
03:32:16.40 --> 03:32:22.32
So a lot of times when I talk about people taking a step back, taking a breath, looking

3851
03:32:22.32 --> 03:32:25.52
around, it's the word I use for them.

3852
03:32:25.52 --> 03:32:27.20
But for doing that is detach.

3853
03:32:27.20 --> 03:32:29.28
You have to detach from the chaos in the mayhem.

3854
03:32:29.28 --> 03:32:31.000
You have to detach from your own emotions.

3855
03:32:31.000 --> 03:32:36.28
Well, interestingly, another thing I will tell people, when they've got more of a, let's

3856
03:32:36.28 --> 03:32:40.40
say a slow burning problem that they want to figure out a solution for, one of the things

3857
03:32:40.40 --> 03:32:46.000
I recommend they do is they write down what the problem is, write down what some various

3858
03:32:46.000 --> 03:32:52.28
solutions are, and what that does is it literally detaches you from the problem because

3859
03:32:52.28 --> 03:32:58.04
now you're having to think through really what this problem is and how you're going to articulate

3860
03:32:58.04 --> 03:32:59.64
it on a piece of paper for yourself.

3861
03:32:59.64 --> 03:33:01.92
And then you're going to look at it from a detached perspective.

3862
03:33:01.92 --> 03:33:04.08
You're going to read the words that you're wrote.

3863
03:33:04.08 --> 03:33:10.56
And it really does, it really does allow you to see a new perspective and hopefully find

3864
03:33:10.56 --> 03:33:11.56
a solution.

3865
03:33:11.56 --> 03:33:16.72
Another thing I've been saying a lot lately is the solutions to your problem are not in the

3866
03:33:16.72 --> 03:33:17.72
problem.

3867
03:33:17.72 --> 03:33:20.84
When you have a problem, the solutions are not in there.

3868
03:33:20.84 --> 03:33:23.12
If the solutions were in there, you just, it wouldn't be a problem.

3869
03:33:23.12 --> 03:33:24.12
You just saw it.

3870
03:33:24.12 --> 03:33:25.64
You have to get outside the problem.

3871
03:33:25.64 --> 03:33:29.40
You have to figure out how to take a step back, how to see it from a different perspective.

3872
03:33:29.40 --> 03:33:33.48
Because if the solution to the problem was in the problem, you would just execute on that

3873
03:33:33.48 --> 03:33:34.48
thing.

3874
03:33:34.48 --> 03:33:35.48
It wouldn't even be an issue.

3875
03:33:35.48 --> 03:33:41.32
So we have to take a step back and one of the best ways to do that if you have the

3876
03:33:41.32 --> 03:33:46.64
time and the opportunity to do it and then usually in what we call the military and administrative

3877
03:33:46.64 --> 03:33:47.64
situation.

3878
03:33:47.64 --> 03:33:52.76
Well, it's fine.

3879
03:33:52.76 --> 03:33:53.04
Sit down, write down what is going on, what the problem is.

3880
03:33:53.04 --> 03:33:55.56
Maybe what some ideas are about viable solutions.

3881
03:33:55.56 --> 03:34:00.20
But I think it's even better to really detail what you see the problem is because if you start

3882
03:34:00.20 --> 03:34:03.60
trying to write down solutions, you're already, you're already trying to impose solutions

3883
03:34:03.60 --> 03:34:04.60
on it.

3884
03:34:04.60 --> 03:34:06.24
Write down what the problem is.

3885
03:34:06.24 --> 03:34:07.24
Look at it.

3886
03:34:07.24 --> 03:34:08.88
Take walk away from it.

3887
03:34:08.88 --> 03:34:10.24
Come back and read it again.

3888
03:34:10.24 --> 03:34:13.52
And you're going to start to see that you're going to have a better chance of finding

3889
03:34:13.52 --> 03:34:16.36
a solution than if you're living inside the problem.

3890
03:34:16.36 --> 03:34:17.76
Yeah, I love that.

3891
03:34:17.76 --> 03:34:18.92
I need to do it more often.

3892
03:34:18.92 --> 03:34:20.48
I used to journal all the time.

3893
03:34:20.48 --> 03:34:23.56
One of the problems with the phone is that it includes the ability of write down a quick

3894
03:34:23.56 --> 03:34:24.56
note.

3895
03:34:24.56 --> 03:34:27.60
I'll use the notes function where I'll put something into my voice memos.

3896
03:34:27.60 --> 03:34:30.08
But anytime I go back, it's very fragmented.

3897
03:34:30.08 --> 03:34:35.64
I think that writing and writing in complete sentences or diagramming is enormously powerful.

3898
03:34:35.64 --> 03:34:40.72
I also, there was something you said that I need to think about in terms of disability

3899
03:34:40.72 --> 03:34:42.20
to zoom out.

3900
03:34:42.20 --> 03:34:44.16
We don't really know what that is.

3901
03:34:44.16 --> 03:34:48.48
But the feeling of being in, we wake up every day and we recognize ourselves in the mirror.

3902
03:34:48.48 --> 03:34:49.88
Amazing if you think about it.

3903
03:34:49.88 --> 03:34:55.20
We never wonder if we're somebody else if provided we're not psychotic.

3904
03:34:55.20 --> 03:34:56.20
Wait a second.

3905
03:34:56.20 --> 03:34:58.76
Let me catch up with the event that we hear because I'm trying to figure out why it's

3906
03:34:58.76 --> 03:35:01.20
amazing that I realize and recognize myself in the mirror.

3907
03:35:01.20 --> 03:35:02.20
Why is that amazing?

3908
03:35:02.20 --> 03:35:05.88
Well, we don't really know where the notion of the self sits in the nervous system.

3909
03:35:05.88 --> 03:35:10.48
And yet we go through life, always experiencing things from a frame of reference of ourselves.

3910
03:35:10.48 --> 03:35:14.000
A few people experience out of body stuff.

3911
03:35:14.000 --> 03:35:18.76
There's a big effort now, of course, to use ketamine type therapies and dissociative and

3912
03:35:18.76 --> 03:35:21.92
aesthetics to help people move out of trauma.

3913
03:35:21.92 --> 03:35:24.52
This is a work that's being done in clinics.

3914
03:35:24.52 --> 03:35:27.32
And I've never tried these things or been part of these trials.

3915
03:35:27.32 --> 03:35:32.28
But every time I hear a patient's report about it, they say, I experience myself as getting

3916
03:35:32.28 --> 03:35:36.20
out of the car, seeing myself in the car of myself.

3917
03:35:36.20 --> 03:35:41.44
Like, you know, normally we wake up in our body and we go, I think that's amazing.

3918
03:35:41.44 --> 03:35:42.76
But in any of them in the mirror scientists.

3919
03:35:42.76 --> 03:35:44.64
I want to understand where you're perspective is.

3920
03:35:44.64 --> 03:35:45.64
Yeah, yeah.

3921
03:35:45.64 --> 03:35:49.000
It's incredible because it's, and we don't know where that sits.

3922
03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:51.36
There's no brain region or brain circuit.

3923
03:35:51.36 --> 03:35:57.64
There's no clinical syndrome that people dissociate from self in that way.

3924
03:35:57.64 --> 03:36:00.68
Maybe multiple personalities, but that's more rare than most people believe.

3925
03:36:00.68 --> 03:36:02.96
But dissociative states are rare.

3926
03:36:02.96 --> 03:36:06.92
And so we go through life mostly from this perspective of meaning, meaning me.

3927
03:36:06.92 --> 03:36:13.64
One thing that's been very helpful to me, at least, has been a colleague.

3928
03:36:13.64 --> 03:36:18.88
Again, Carl Diceraw said, you know, most of the time, we have no idea how other people

3929
03:36:18.88 --> 03:36:19.88
feel.

3930
03:36:19.88 --> 03:36:21.48
In fact, most of the time, we don't even know how we feel.

3931
03:36:21.48 --> 03:36:22.48
We don't even know how to.

3932
03:36:22.48 --> 03:36:25.12
We don't even have a language that can explain feelings.

3933
03:36:25.12 --> 03:36:26.84
I don't know if how you feel right now.

3934
03:36:26.84 --> 03:36:29.80
It relates at all to my understanding of how you feel.

3935
03:36:29.80 --> 03:36:32.52
We can start really drifting into the weird and abstracting.

3936
03:36:32.52 --> 03:36:35.68
As you've noticed up until now, I'm a pretty nuts and bolts guy.

3937
03:36:35.68 --> 03:36:37.76
I like physiology.

3938
03:36:37.76 --> 03:36:40.40
I love physiology of the nervous system and hormone systems.

3939
03:36:40.40 --> 03:36:41.60
That's mainly what I've worked on.

3940
03:36:41.60 --> 03:36:43.60
But I like actionable tools.

3941
03:36:43.60 --> 03:36:49.24
I like, you know, in the military, right, I have to assume that before a gunfight, you can't

3942
03:36:49.24 --> 03:36:51.80
just say, all right, guys, be brave and go in with a full heart.

3943
03:36:51.80 --> 03:36:54.64
Right, you need, like, this is what happens when X happens.

3944
03:36:54.64 --> 03:36:55.64
You need plans.

3945
03:36:55.64 --> 03:36:56.64
You need protocols.

3946
03:36:56.64 --> 03:36:58.68
And in science and neuroscience, there are now protocols.

3947
03:36:58.68 --> 03:36:59.92
We've been talking about those.

3948
03:36:59.92 --> 03:37:03.72
But then there are the more abstract notions of the self and others and how to do that.

3949
03:37:03.72 --> 03:37:08.68
And I think that's really where the future of neuroscience lies is in trying to parse some

3950
03:37:08.68 --> 03:37:10.92
of those deeper understandings.

3951
03:37:10.92 --> 03:37:13.44
I don't have any knowledge to shed on that.

3952
03:37:13.44 --> 03:37:17.72
All I can say is that we all are very self-oriented.

3953
03:37:17.72 --> 03:37:20.08
We all tend to approach life through the lens of self.

3954
03:37:20.08 --> 03:37:24.20
And so I'm struck again and again when I read your book and when talking today, your ability

3955
03:37:24.20 --> 03:37:26.36
to this notion of taking other perspectives.

3956
03:37:26.36 --> 03:37:29.96
I think that's probably hard work for most people.

3957
03:37:29.96 --> 03:37:35.48
That occurs to me as something that's probably just as important to practice as writing

3958
03:37:35.48 --> 03:37:36.96
in complete sentences.

3959
03:37:36.96 --> 03:37:45.56
Yeah, I have a couple triggers that I use when you approach me with your plan.

3960
03:37:45.56 --> 03:37:47.32
And your plan doesn't make sense to me.

3961
03:37:47.32 --> 03:37:49.80
That immediately tells me, okay, he sees something.

3962
03:37:49.80 --> 03:37:50.80
I don't see.

3963
03:37:50.80 --> 03:37:51.80
I need to try and get in his head.

3964
03:37:51.80 --> 03:37:55.04
I need to try and figure out what his perspective is.

3965
03:37:55.04 --> 03:37:59.92
When you're mad, you come into my office and I can see that you're mad.

3966
03:37:59.92 --> 03:38:02.64
I immediately, I'm not thinking what's wrong with him.

3967
03:38:02.64 --> 03:38:05.08
I'm thinking of what is he see that I don't see.

3968
03:38:05.08 --> 03:38:11.20
And yeah, that's a critical part of not only just leadership, but just interacting

3969
03:38:11.20 --> 03:38:12.20
with other human beings.

3970
03:38:12.20 --> 03:38:15.88
You know, if you're, when I'm married, I've been married for a long time.

3971
03:38:15.88 --> 03:38:18.60
When my wife, I can see a look on her face.

3972
03:38:18.60 --> 03:38:20.44
She's not happy.

3973
03:38:20.44 --> 03:38:24.24
I think what is happening, what is she seeing?

3974
03:38:24.24 --> 03:38:27.88
What's her perspective on this that's making her not happy right now?

3975
03:38:27.88 --> 03:38:31.52
Because it's not going to benefit me to have her continue down this path.

3976
03:38:31.52 --> 03:38:35.80
And it's usually something that I can make an adjustment on pretty quickly.

3977
03:38:35.80 --> 03:38:40.44
And allow her to see maybe what some of what I'm seeing or allow her to see a little bit

3978
03:38:40.44 --> 03:38:41.44
of a different perspective.

3979
03:38:41.44 --> 03:38:43.16
So, yeah, extremely important.

3980
03:38:43.16 --> 03:38:49.76
Don't you ever do some things like even as a scientist where you're, do running an

3981
03:38:49.76 --> 03:38:55.28
experiment and you get done and it kind of felt like it was just kind of happening, like

3982
03:38:55.28 --> 03:38:56.28
you weren't.

3983
03:38:56.28 --> 03:38:59.12
Like, you know, they say I definitely have felt that way.

3984
03:38:59.12 --> 03:39:02.20
I feel like, you know, if I'm doing Gigiitsu, have a good role.

3985
03:39:02.20 --> 03:39:03.20
Man, I'm not in there.

3986
03:39:03.20 --> 03:39:05.84
I'm kind of watching.

3987
03:39:05.84 --> 03:39:06.84
You want to do that.

3988
03:39:06.84 --> 03:39:08.04
You want to be able to detach.

3989
03:39:08.04 --> 03:39:11.28
Do you have that in your business?

3990
03:39:11.28 --> 03:39:14.04
Yeah, that, you know, people talk about flow states.

3991
03:39:14.04 --> 03:39:16.32
And I'm friendly with Stephen Kotler.

3992
03:39:16.32 --> 03:39:18.04
And so I like to joke about flow.

3993
03:39:18.04 --> 03:39:22.04
The most thing that, the most that we can say about flow at this point in history is that

3994
03:39:22.04 --> 03:39:23.60
backwards it spells wolf.

3995
03:39:23.60 --> 03:39:27.72
I mean, I don't think we really know how that's generated in the brain.

3996
03:39:27.72 --> 03:39:31.52
Because some people describe it as a sense of losing time and being really in the experience.

3997
03:39:31.52 --> 03:39:34.72
Other people describe it as being, you know, kind of third personing the experience.

3998
03:39:34.72 --> 03:39:39.20
And so, this is more of a call to action for more definition about what flow is.

3999
03:39:39.20 --> 03:39:43.12
It probably, probably five different kinds of flow.

4000
03:39:43.12 --> 03:39:47.40
I've certainly had the experience of automaticity where I'm like, who's actually doing

4001
03:39:47.40 --> 03:39:48.40
this stuff?

4002
03:39:48.40 --> 03:39:51.80
You know, you get into these action patterns that are so trained.

4003
03:39:51.80 --> 03:39:55.60
You're just watching yourself, you know, from you, it would be really nerdy stuff.

4004
03:39:55.60 --> 03:39:57.88
I can dissect a retina like nobody else.

4005
03:39:57.88 --> 03:40:00.80
Like, but that way, if you need me to take out an eyeball and put a retina on and then

4006
03:40:00.80 --> 03:40:03.08
get under a microscope, like, I'm your guy.

4007
03:40:03.08 --> 03:40:05.92
I've done it so many hundreds of thousands of times.

4008
03:40:05.92 --> 03:40:10.000
And so, from so many different eyeballs, everything from human eyeballs right down to, you know,

4009
03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:11.36
a marmuset eyeball.

4010
03:40:11.36 --> 03:40:14.60
So, I'm the guy for that.

4011
03:40:14.60 --> 03:40:20.44
But typically, I think I'm not used to third personing quite as much.

4012
03:40:20.44 --> 03:40:21.44
I've certainly situations.

4013
03:40:21.44 --> 03:40:22.44
I try and look at situations.

4014
03:40:22.44 --> 03:40:25.40
I tend to do it by assembling a small team.

4015
03:40:25.40 --> 03:40:27.24
So if they're data, I don't, they don't make sense.

4016
03:40:27.24 --> 03:40:30.68
Or, my podcast team, my love working in small group of guys.

4017
03:40:30.68 --> 03:40:33.80
And we, you know, whiteboard, what do we want to do?

4018
03:40:33.80 --> 03:40:34.80
How do we want to structure things?

4019
03:40:34.80 --> 03:40:38.76
So I tend to outsource my forebrain.

4020
03:40:38.76 --> 03:40:43.80
One of the things that you see in, and I'm not describing myself here, but in creatives,

4021
03:40:43.80 --> 03:40:45.24
they need handlers.

4022
03:40:45.24 --> 03:40:49.76
People that are very creative learn to put those spotlights into their creative endeavour

4023
03:40:49.76 --> 03:40:53.24
so much so that making toast is work.

4024
03:40:53.24 --> 03:40:58.12
And so they tend to, as they achieve more success, dedicating more and more of the everyday

4025
03:40:58.12 --> 03:41:02.000
things to other people in an effort to try and get in that narrow trench.

4026
03:41:02.000 --> 03:41:05.80
And so they're really taking, instead of trying to spin multiple plates related to multiple

4027
03:41:05.80 --> 03:41:10.96
things, they're like, let's get all the plates spinning in unison and just focus on this.

4028
03:41:10.96 --> 03:41:12.76
And that could be very beneficial.

4029
03:41:12.76 --> 03:41:20.20
But it does tend to take away that ability to outsource and be a multitasker.

4030
03:41:20.20 --> 03:41:22.96
And so I think success is a dangerous thing in that way.

4031
03:41:22.96 --> 03:41:25.64
Because the further up you go in science, the fewer experiments you're doing and the

4032
03:41:25.64 --> 03:41:27.08
more you're just focused on narrow things.

4033
03:41:27.08 --> 03:41:30.16
And there, sometimes people bring me data and I'll say, oh, that means this.

4034
03:41:30.16 --> 03:41:31.40
And like, no, that means that.

4035
03:41:31.40 --> 03:41:33.76
And I'm like, well, I've been doing this a lot longer than you have.

4036
03:41:33.76 --> 03:41:37.64
And I'm, well, the professor at Stanford, then I went think to myself, I'm way say,

4037
03:41:37.64 --> 03:41:40.36
they're a lot closer to the data than I am.

4038
03:41:40.36 --> 03:41:42.08
And so we sit back and look at it as a group.

4039
03:41:42.08 --> 03:41:43.60
So I tend to do it through groups.

4040
03:41:43.60 --> 03:41:44.76
But I'll be on the lookout for this.

4041
03:41:44.76 --> 03:41:51.32
Anytime you've described third personning or this notion of good growth from stress, great.

4042
03:41:51.32 --> 03:41:52.88
Now I know why you say that.

4043
03:41:52.88 --> 03:41:59.000
I think we can put a neuroscience definition on that because more stress equals more growth.

4044
03:41:59.000 --> 03:42:03.12
Something that most people don't believe in alley crumbs, work, research on the seal

4045
03:42:03.12 --> 03:42:07.52
teams, indicates if not proves that they believe this.

4046
03:42:07.52 --> 03:42:09.04
More stress equals more growth.

4047
03:42:09.04 --> 03:42:12.88
I think that's something that I'm certainly trying to adopt more and more in my life.

4048
03:42:12.88 --> 03:42:16.68
Especially as I get older, we tend to get a little complacent in certain our ways.

4049
03:42:16.68 --> 03:42:17.68
No.

4050
03:42:17.68 --> 03:42:22.08
Well, not you, but we, no, not you either.

4051
03:42:22.08 --> 03:42:27.52
People in general, some of us tend to default towards the things that feel good and move

4052
03:42:27.52 --> 03:42:28.52
away from friction.

4053
03:42:28.52 --> 03:42:34.36
But if friction is the lever for growth and more friction equals more growth, and absolutely

4054
03:42:34.36 --> 03:42:39.000
it does, well, then your statement good makes complete sense.

4055
03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:44.96
So, what do we, what do we do in food wise?

4056
03:42:44.96 --> 03:42:49.000
How, how deeper you into diet food?

4057
03:42:49.000 --> 03:42:50.000
What are we doing?

4058
03:42:50.000 --> 03:42:53.68
We know we get, let's, let's go back to, you know, we woke up in the morning.

4059
03:42:53.68 --> 03:43:00.64
We got some, we got some light, we did some workout, we haven't taken any caffeine yet.

4060
03:43:00.64 --> 03:43:03.24
We maybe we hopped in the cold bath.

4061
03:43:03.24 --> 03:43:06.56
Now it's start, you know, now the day is moving along.

4062
03:43:06.56 --> 03:43:08.12
At what point are we eating?

4063
03:43:08.12 --> 03:43:09.12
11 a.m.

4064
03:43:09.12 --> 03:43:11.96
Very similar to me.

4065
03:43:11.96 --> 03:43:13.36
What are we eating at 11 a.m.?

4066
03:43:13.36 --> 03:43:20.52
I mean, I'm laughing as I, in size, I say this because recently, if you want to engage those

4067
03:43:20.52 --> 03:43:26.16
neural circuits for battle online, just talk about nutrition or training.

4068
03:43:26.16 --> 03:43:27.16
Oh, yeah.

4069
03:43:27.16 --> 03:43:31.36
You know, I'm going to talk about what works for me.

4070
03:43:31.36 --> 03:43:37.16
And I'm 46 and I'm happy that I can run far, not too fast, but I can run far, and I

4071
03:43:37.16 --> 03:43:41.24
can lift objects that certainly are not the heaviest objects in any environment, but I'm

4072
03:43:41.24 --> 03:43:43.64
comfortable with my strength and endurance.

4073
03:43:43.64 --> 03:43:45.000
And I feel good.

4074
03:43:45.000 --> 03:43:46.000
That's what matters to me.

4075
03:43:46.000 --> 03:43:50.64
And then I can focus, and I can work even after I train.

4076
03:43:50.64 --> 03:43:55.16
So when I wake up, I'm going to hydrate 90 minutes to two hours later, I'm going to drink

4077
03:43:55.16 --> 03:44:02.08
caffeine, which is typically yerbomate, pour over yerbomate, not the smoky ones turns

4078
03:44:02.08 --> 03:44:03.08
out.

4079
03:44:03.08 --> 03:44:05.48
The smoky ones are loaded with carcinogens, so that's bad as smoking.

4080
03:44:05.48 --> 03:44:06.48
That sounds fine.

4081
03:44:06.48 --> 03:44:09.08
Really bad, but I like that stuff a lot.

4082
03:44:09.08 --> 03:44:11.64
And I'm not just saying this to make you guys happy.

4083
03:44:11.64 --> 03:44:13.52
I'm loving these energy drinks.

4084
03:44:13.52 --> 03:44:16.32
I've been drinking them for a few weeks now, so loving it.

4085
03:44:16.32 --> 03:44:18.92
Also because I don't like sucralose.

4086
03:44:18.92 --> 03:44:19.92
Oh, yeah.

4087
03:44:19.92 --> 03:44:20.92
You did the ingredient check.

4088
03:44:20.92 --> 03:44:21.92
I did the ingredient check.

4089
03:44:21.92 --> 03:44:26.44
And it's not, I don't dislike sucralose because I think it's going to kill my microbiome.

4090
03:44:26.44 --> 03:44:28.64
I'm not trying to be catastrophic about it.

4091
03:44:28.64 --> 03:44:31.40
I just don't like the way it tastes.

4092
03:44:31.40 --> 03:44:33.80
But I think Monk Fruit's DVA Tamir Fine.

4093
03:44:33.80 --> 03:44:36.68
I like occasionally have some ass per team.

4094
03:44:36.68 --> 03:44:38.52
I'm not a big consumer of ass per team, but yeah, the fact that it's sweet and with

4095
03:44:38.52 --> 03:44:40.96
monk fruit, I like, no, they're not paying me to say this.

4096
03:44:40.96 --> 03:44:42.24
I really like this stuff.

4097
03:44:42.24 --> 03:44:44.16
Although I'd be happy to work with you guys.

4098
03:44:44.16 --> 03:44:47.12
I think I want to just be clear.

4099
03:44:47.12 --> 03:44:52.16
The alpha GPC is something that I take in supplement form, unless I'm having drinking

4100
03:44:52.16 --> 03:44:54.04
something that has alpha GPC in it.

4101
03:44:54.04 --> 03:44:55.04
They're good data on it.

4102
03:44:55.04 --> 03:44:59.80
Alpha GPC is basically a co-lean donor increases the cdocolline, which is a molecule released

4103
03:44:59.80 --> 03:45:06.08
from the nucleus basalis of my Nurt, my Nurt was the anatomus, that helps enhance the intensity

4104
03:45:06.08 --> 03:45:11.12
of those spotlights to put sort of a general description on it and the ability to engage

4105
03:45:11.12 --> 03:45:12.12
those spotlights.

4106
03:45:12.12 --> 03:45:14.56
So, alpha G, why we put it in there?

4107
03:45:14.56 --> 03:45:18.36
So alpha GPC is something that, you know, and there's some evidence that it can offset

4108
03:45:18.36 --> 03:45:20.56
some age-related cognitive decline in those kinds of things.

4109
03:45:20.56 --> 03:45:22.52
So there are a number of things in there that I like.

4110
03:45:22.52 --> 03:45:24.52
So I'll drink some caffeine.

4111
03:45:24.52 --> 03:45:26.48
I trained in the early part of the day.

4112
03:45:26.48 --> 03:45:30.44
That I can just quickly say that, or we can talk about training separately, but I hit

4113
03:45:30.44 --> 03:45:32.16
the weights every other day.

4114
03:45:32.16 --> 03:45:40.20
I run on the days I don't train with weights, and I do all workouts for about an hour.

4115
03:45:40.20 --> 03:45:42.40
Very basic, but I'm doing that for 30 years.

4116
03:45:42.40 --> 03:45:47.92
I train, you know, I can get into the details, but you know, anyway.

4117
03:45:47.92 --> 03:45:52.08
The food thing is, basically after I train, I can last about an hour or so before I'm

4118
03:45:52.08 --> 03:45:56.16
really hungry, and then I'll typically have some fruit and some starch.

4119
03:45:56.16 --> 03:46:00.16
If I've trained hard, if it's a glycogen depleting workout, you know, hit the weights,

4120
03:46:00.16 --> 03:46:03.88
then I'll have a big bowl of oatmeal and some fruit, and I make sure I actually like

4121
03:46:03.88 --> 03:46:09.04
throwing a little bit of butter and some fish oil in there, and, you know, some fats

4122
03:46:09.04 --> 03:46:10.44
and a protein drink.

4123
03:46:10.44 --> 03:46:16.44
At 11, and then around 130 or two, I want a real meal.

4124
03:46:16.44 --> 03:46:21.24
And on the days when I don't train with the weights, I typically don't have that oatmeal,

4125
03:46:21.24 --> 03:46:22.24
protein drink meal.

4126
03:46:22.24 --> 03:46:26.72
Instead, I'll have a real meal right at 11 or so.

4127
03:46:26.72 --> 03:46:29.60
And typically it's a piece of meat, a piece of grass fed meat.

4128
03:46:29.60 --> 03:46:31.52
Usually at stake, I do not like chicken.

4129
03:46:31.52 --> 03:46:32.52
I don't know why.

4130
03:46:32.52 --> 03:46:33.52
It just doesn't appeal to me.

4131
03:46:33.52 --> 03:46:35.04
I'll eat it if I have to.

4132
03:46:35.04 --> 03:46:37.84
I might have a piece of salmon, but I'm not crazy about salmon.

4133
03:46:37.84 --> 03:46:45.36
I'll have a piece of grass fed beef, like a rib eye or a hamburger patty or two and a salad.

4134
03:46:45.36 --> 03:46:50.72
And maybe I'll have a slice of bread or something, a good bread.

4135
03:46:50.72 --> 03:46:51.72
Usually not.

4136
03:46:51.72 --> 03:46:53.76
And then through the afternoon, I'm good.

4137
03:46:53.76 --> 03:46:58.20
I typically will work anytime I'm not training or eating.

4138
03:46:58.20 --> 03:47:03.20
I try and just eat and not do work at the same time, but often times I'm eating while

4139
03:47:03.20 --> 03:47:05.20
I'm eating while I'm working.

4140
03:47:05.20 --> 03:47:07.32
So I have lunch and take care of some email.

4141
03:47:07.32 --> 03:47:12.000
And then in the afternoon, I will do, after lunch, I'll typically lie down and do an

4142
03:47:12.000 --> 03:47:15.76
NSTR, get a little nap, wake up, and sleep sleep.

4143
03:47:15.76 --> 03:47:20.12
Where I'll go under into the state of deep relaxation for 10 to 30 minutes.

4144
03:47:20.12 --> 03:47:23.36
And then I can really do another work about in the afternoon.

4145
03:47:23.36 --> 03:47:25.52
So I do some work in the morning, obviously.

4146
03:47:25.52 --> 03:47:26.68
I work out in the morning.

4147
03:47:26.68 --> 03:47:31.76
I eat at 11, the post workout and then a lunch or just the lunch if I didn't work

4148
03:47:31.76 --> 03:47:33.12
out with the weights.

4149
03:47:33.12 --> 03:47:37.88
And then I will do a little bit of deep relaxation, 10 to 30 minutes.

4150
03:47:37.88 --> 03:47:38.88
Get up from that.

4151
03:47:38.88 --> 03:47:41.20
Hydrate, I'll typically take a quick walk outside.

4152
03:47:41.20 --> 03:47:43.24
So none of that takes more than about 15 minutes.

4153
03:47:43.24 --> 03:47:46.000
And then I try and drop into another work about.

4154
03:47:46.000 --> 03:47:48.000
And throughout the afternoon, yeah.

4155
03:47:48.000 --> 03:47:53.68
Yeah, because I think of these as 90 minutes of work, the brain functions and what

4156
03:47:53.68 --> 03:47:54.96
are called all trading cycles.

4157
03:47:54.96 --> 03:47:58.36
We have circadian, which means 24, all trading, which is 90 minutes cycles.

4158
03:47:58.36 --> 03:48:01.72
All your sleep is broken up into 90 minutes cycles.

4159
03:48:01.72 --> 03:48:04.40
All your waking states are broken up into 90 minutes cycles.

4160
03:48:04.40 --> 03:48:09.000
With some training, you can teach yourself to focus really hard on something for about 90 minutes.

4161
03:48:09.000 --> 03:48:12.64
But sometimes it's email, sometimes it's writing, sometimes it's data analysis, sometimes

4162
03:48:12.64 --> 03:48:14.44
it's podcast prep, et cetera.

4163
03:48:14.44 --> 03:48:19.80
But after about 90 minutes of intense work, I try and take a minute, view a horizon, relax,

4164
03:48:19.80 --> 03:48:20.80
walk around.

4165
03:48:20.80 --> 03:48:22.36
I try not to look at my phone.

4166
03:48:22.36 --> 03:48:24.60
And then I'll go back into another bout of work.

4167
03:48:24.60 --> 03:48:28.48
So I'm getting three or four intense bout to work throughout the day.

4168
03:48:28.48 --> 03:48:32.56
And then I'm not eating in the afternoon throughout that afternoon.

4169
03:48:32.56 --> 03:48:34.44
I had one or two meals already.

4170
03:48:34.44 --> 03:48:41.08
And then I typically will eat dinner, depends, seven or eight PM.

4171
03:48:41.08 --> 03:48:43.96
And I tend to put more carbohydrates in the evening.

4172
03:48:43.96 --> 03:48:45.68
I know some people gasped at that.

4173
03:48:45.68 --> 03:48:46.68
But come through.

4174
03:48:46.68 --> 03:48:50.08
I'm not saying to you guys.

4175
03:48:50.08 --> 03:48:55.000
But if you do a workout of the sort that I do in the morning, it sets typically to failure.

4176
03:48:55.000 --> 03:48:56.88
I'm training not real quick.

4177
03:48:56.88 --> 03:48:58.36
But you know, you're pleading that glycogen.

4178
03:48:58.36 --> 03:49:00.16
I'm fine to have a plate of pasta.

4179
03:49:00.16 --> 03:49:04.36
And I'd have a little bit less protein in the evening because I find it very hard to get

4180
03:49:04.36 --> 03:49:07.72
good sleep in an in a low carb state.

4181
03:49:07.72 --> 03:49:09.84
See, I will.

4182
03:49:09.84 --> 03:49:15.32
If I want to sleep, or let's say, maybe something happened where I didn't have a hard

4183
03:49:15.32 --> 03:49:16.32
workout during the day.

4184
03:49:16.32 --> 03:49:18.68
And I know I'm going to have a hard time for almost a week.

4185
03:49:18.68 --> 03:49:21.08
I'm like a little bit of that rice going in the other.

4186
03:49:21.08 --> 03:49:24.84
This is my last time spaghetti going up in there because I'm going that carb.

4187
03:49:24.84 --> 03:49:25.84
Oh, yeah.

4188
03:49:25.84 --> 03:49:26.84
Damn, you know, coma.

4189
03:49:26.84 --> 03:49:27.84
Yeah.

4190
03:49:27.84 --> 03:49:29.36
Well, you know, I'll do that.

4191
03:49:29.36 --> 03:49:31.08
But we're not talking enormous volumes.

4192
03:49:31.08 --> 03:49:32.08
Oh, I am.

4193
03:49:32.08 --> 03:49:37.44
So some rice or some pasta, some risotto or something.

4194
03:49:37.44 --> 03:49:39.48
I'm fortunate that my girlfriend's a really good cook.

4195
03:49:39.48 --> 03:49:40.48
So she'll say, what do you want?

4196
03:49:40.48 --> 03:49:42.20
And then I'll tell her and she'll cook it.

4197
03:49:42.20 --> 03:49:44.04
She was a professional chef for a long time.

4198
03:49:44.04 --> 03:49:45.04
Oh, she's an average.

4199
03:49:45.04 --> 03:49:46.04
And she's fast.

4200
03:49:46.04 --> 03:49:47.68
So basically, she says, what do you want to eat today in that kind of thing?

4201
03:49:47.68 --> 03:49:49.48
And so that's what I get.

4202
03:49:49.48 --> 03:49:52.28
And I'm very lucky in that way.

4203
03:49:52.28 --> 03:49:55.56
The one thing that I make sure to do is we know what we can edit that out.

4204
03:49:55.56 --> 03:50:01.04
You don't want to give up that kind of leverage in this scenario.

4205
03:50:01.04 --> 03:50:03.68
We can edit it out.

4206
03:50:03.68 --> 03:50:09.96
I'm really big on that evening meal being mostly carbohydrates.

4207
03:50:09.96 --> 03:50:13.40
Also vegetables that happen to really like vegetables and less protein.

4208
03:50:13.40 --> 03:50:18.56
So I might have a small piece of fish or some broth, a soup or something like that.

4209
03:50:18.56 --> 03:50:24.36
And keep in mind that I'm not usually eating anything until 11 o'clock the next day.

4210
03:50:24.36 --> 03:50:27.76
And I'm likely going to train again in the morning or run again in the morning.

4211
03:50:27.76 --> 03:50:29.92
And so I want my glycogen top-dough.

4212
03:50:29.92 --> 03:50:33.84
I'm not looking to walk around at 6% body fat or anything like that.

4213
03:50:33.84 --> 03:50:38.12
I keep a relatively low body fat percentage and have for a long time.

4214
03:50:38.12 --> 03:50:40.16
I feel good where I'm at.

4215
03:50:40.16 --> 03:50:42.36
EBS inflows depending on the season.

4216
03:50:42.36 --> 03:50:45.52
But I have zero appetite for sugar.

4217
03:50:45.52 --> 03:50:46.88
And that's a recent thing.

4218
03:50:46.88 --> 03:50:51.44
A few years ago, I just stopped having the half glass of wine just because everyone else

4219
03:50:51.44 --> 03:50:52.72
was doing it.

4220
03:50:52.72 --> 03:50:56.12
I stopped having dessert just because.

4221
03:50:56.12 --> 03:50:57.88
And I noticed that I didn't like it.

4222
03:50:57.88 --> 03:50:59.80
And I just didn't make me feel good.

4223
03:50:59.80 --> 03:51:04.88
And I'd much rather consume calories from clean sources like rice and meat and fish and vegetables.

4224
03:51:04.88 --> 03:51:05.88
It's kind of thing.

4225
03:51:05.88 --> 03:51:07.24
I do eat some fruit.

4226
03:51:07.24 --> 03:51:08.24
I'm not huge on dairy.

4227
03:51:08.24 --> 03:51:13.000
But I'll have a little bit of really good cheese, really good Parmesan cheese or really

4228
03:51:13.000 --> 03:51:14.000
good fermented cheese.

4229
03:51:14.000 --> 03:51:16.92
One thing that's very clear from the scientific literature.

4230
03:51:16.92 --> 03:51:22.80
This is the work of Justin Sonnenberg and Chris Gardner at Stanford that fermented foods,

4231
03:51:22.80 --> 03:51:29.20
low sugar fermented foods, sour crowd, kimchi, low sugar kombucha, Greek yogurt, unsweetened

4232
03:51:29.20 --> 03:51:30.36
Greek yogurt.

4233
03:51:30.36 --> 03:51:35.44
Enhanced the gut microbiome, these trillions of gut bacteria, that actually make the sort

4234
03:51:35.44 --> 03:51:40.12
of neurotransmitters that cross into the blood-bring barrier and create the substrate for things

4235
03:51:40.12 --> 03:51:43.36
like dopamine and up in effort, and, et cetera.

4236
03:51:43.36 --> 03:51:45.84
And can reduce inflammation markers.

4237
03:51:45.84 --> 03:51:47.24
They call this the inflamatoma.

4238
03:51:47.24 --> 03:51:48.24
It's like looking at your genome.

4239
03:51:48.24 --> 03:51:53.64
They looked at inflammatory markers in people that consumed four servings, which is not

4240
03:51:53.64 --> 03:51:58.64
a lot, four two-ounce servings of low sugar fermented foods per day.

4241
03:51:58.64 --> 03:52:00.16
They're to increasing their fiber.

4242
03:52:00.16 --> 03:52:05.16
Now, I'm not disparaging a fiber, but what they found was that people who ate a lot of fiber

4243
03:52:05.16 --> 03:52:08.80
either increased inflammatory markers, maintained or decreased.

4244
03:52:08.80 --> 03:52:10.96
It was all over the place.

4245
03:52:10.96 --> 03:52:12.44
Mainly the effect of being a lot of fibers.

4246
03:52:12.44 --> 03:52:16.36
You increased the number of enzymes that you make that digest fiber.

4247
03:52:16.36 --> 03:52:21.28
The people who ate a lot of fermented food, low sugar fermented foods across the board

4248
03:52:21.28 --> 03:52:23.28
reduced these inflammatory markers.

4249
03:52:23.28 --> 03:52:26.40
I feel better when I'm eating some kimchi, sour crowd, et cetera.

4250
03:52:26.40 --> 03:52:28.84
We started making our own, meaning she makes it.

4251
03:52:28.84 --> 03:52:30.36
I don't make it.

4252
03:52:30.36 --> 03:52:33.64
To do that, we went to Tim Ferriss's four-hour body book.

4253
03:52:33.64 --> 03:52:34.88
There's a rest of our chef.

4254
03:52:34.88 --> 03:52:35.88
Excuse me.

4255
03:52:35.88 --> 03:52:39.44
He describes in there a way that you can cut up cabbage and ferment it with some salt water.

4256
03:52:39.44 --> 03:52:42.72
You have to do this properly because you can get some harmful bacteria, but if you do

4257
03:52:42.72 --> 03:52:46.12
it covered with a cloth, you put in the dark, you take it out, you skim off the bad stuff.

4258
03:52:46.12 --> 03:52:47.12
It's kind of fun.

4259
03:52:47.12 --> 03:52:51.92
The reason for doing this is that a lot of live culture fermented foods can get pretty

4260
03:52:51.92 --> 03:52:53.92
expensive if you have an appetite like mine.

4261
03:52:53.92 --> 03:52:57.60
I love to eat and I'll just eat it by the bowl for.

4262
03:52:57.60 --> 03:53:02.20
The pretty senior dropping $10 here, if you're down in kombucha left and right, you're drinking

4263
03:53:02.20 --> 03:53:07.44
some of the most expensive food, it's more expensive than petroleum.

4264
03:53:07.44 --> 03:53:11.68
We have big vats of kimchi and this kind of thing, and I like hot sauces, so she's figured

4265
03:53:11.68 --> 03:53:13.72
out how to make fermented hot sauces.

4266
03:53:13.72 --> 03:53:15.84
You can do all this stuff easily.

4267
03:53:15.84 --> 03:53:19.16
I'm always eating fermented sauces and foods throughout the day.

4268
03:53:19.16 --> 03:53:24.52
She's okay, although I think if you don't do it right, it can be pretty foul to be around

4269
03:53:24.52 --> 03:53:27.52
the smell is pretty intense.

4270
03:53:27.52 --> 03:53:31.84
Occasionally, I'll have a slice of cobblers, but that's like once or twice a year.

4271
03:53:31.84 --> 03:53:33.44
I just don't have an appetite for it.

4272
03:53:33.44 --> 03:53:38.76
I really look forward to the post-training meal, a big bowl of oatmeal, or yes, occasionally

4273
03:53:38.76 --> 03:53:40.36
if I'm training at a gym someplace.

4274
03:53:40.36 --> 03:53:42.88
I'll be like, how do I get some glycogen back in my system?

4275
03:53:42.88 --> 03:53:45.24
It's two bananas and a few bagels.

4276
03:53:45.24 --> 03:53:47.24
Yeah, I've done it before.

4277
03:53:47.24 --> 03:53:48.88
There's no cast you out.

4278
03:53:48.88 --> 03:53:54.36
Well, on the internet, you're like, oh my goodness, I don't know why this topic of nutrition

4279
03:53:54.36 --> 03:53:57.04
it has people so up in arms.

4280
03:53:57.04 --> 03:54:01.92
I'm not trying to cure carnivore thing.

4281
03:54:01.92 --> 03:54:09.28
I understand you can re-pack glycogen with gluconeogenesis protein converted to other fuels.

4282
03:54:09.28 --> 03:54:14.08
I've not tried the plant-based thing because I would just be thinking about cows all day.

4283
03:54:14.08 --> 03:54:16.36
I like the animal, but I would just be craving meat.

4284
03:54:16.36 --> 03:54:18.56
My dad's Argentine after all.

4285
03:54:18.56 --> 03:54:21.56
I don't tend to do cheat days anymore, that kind of thing.

4286
03:54:21.56 --> 03:54:25.08
I shed that in my early 40s.

4287
03:54:25.08 --> 03:54:27.32
But yeah, that's pretty basic.

4288
03:54:27.32 --> 03:54:29.36
There's caffeine in the early part of the day.

4289
03:54:29.36 --> 03:54:30.96
Hydration is really key.

4290
03:54:30.96 --> 03:54:33.32
I mean, I think for the brain and for the body, hydration's key.

4291
03:54:33.32 --> 03:54:37.44
And then we're not talking so much about supplements, but if there were one supplement that's

4292
03:54:37.44 --> 03:54:42.56
really been shown to be useful for physical performance, but also where most of the data

4293
03:54:42.56 --> 03:54:46.80
point to is for brain fuel is creatine.

4294
03:54:46.80 --> 03:54:53.20
The for brain system depends on a phosphocreatine type fuel in addition to glucose.

4295
03:54:53.20 --> 03:54:56.52
So I do five grams of creatine monohydrate a day.

4296
03:54:56.52 --> 03:55:00.12
I will do the alpha GPC in an energy drink or before training.

4297
03:55:00.12 --> 03:55:03.64
A lot of people forget that energy is not just caloric.

4298
03:55:03.64 --> 03:55:07.48
There's neural energy, dopamine, or up in effort.

4299
03:55:07.48 --> 03:55:09.84
We talked about the meat.

4300
03:55:09.84 --> 03:55:12.16
If you meet is rich with tyrosine.

4301
03:55:12.16 --> 03:55:17.80
tyrosine is in amino acid, red meat especially, that's the precursor to dopamine.

4302
03:55:17.80 --> 03:55:23.36
Carbohydrates and white meat turkey are rich in the amino acid, triptophan, which is the precursor

4303
03:55:23.36 --> 03:55:24.36
to serotonin.

4304
03:55:24.36 --> 03:55:28.76
And so as I say this, it probably all makes sense that you can generate states of alertness

4305
03:55:28.76 --> 03:55:32.32
and states of sleepiness depending on what you eat.

4306
03:55:32.32 --> 03:55:37.04
I will say, however, if you in the enormous volume of anything, you will direct more blood

4307
03:55:37.04 --> 03:55:38.60
to your gut relative to your brain.

4308
03:55:38.60 --> 03:55:43.84
So if you have five ribbi steaks or two ribbi steaks depending on how big they are,

4309
03:55:43.84 --> 03:55:45.72
yes, you will have a lot of tyrosine in your system.

4310
03:55:45.72 --> 03:55:48.56
You also have a lot of blood in your gut and you'll be tired and you want to go to sleep.

4311
03:55:48.56 --> 03:55:51.52
So you can't beat the system completely.

4312
03:55:51.52 --> 03:55:53.36
But yeah, that's pretty much how I eat.

4313
03:55:53.36 --> 03:55:54.76
And I maintain some flexibility.

4314
03:55:54.76 --> 03:55:56.04
I mean, we're in San Diego right now.

4315
03:55:56.04 --> 03:55:57.04
I miss tacos.

4316
03:55:57.04 --> 03:55:59.60
I'm talking to Tuesday and San Diego is a special experience.

4317
03:55:59.60 --> 03:56:03.28
Occasionally, I'll have a white-to-kill of margarito, which I love.

4318
03:56:03.28 --> 03:56:06.72
Everyone's like, I'm not a super extreme guy on this stuff.

4319
03:56:06.72 --> 03:56:12.32
But I would love to be pure carnivore or pure vegan.

4320
03:56:12.32 --> 03:56:13.32
Sorry, Paul Saladino.

4321
03:56:13.32 --> 03:56:16.44
He's a friend and I have some vegan friends like Rich Roll.

4322
03:56:16.44 --> 03:56:19.16
I just don't want to live that way.

4323
03:56:19.16 --> 03:56:22.08
And I'm probably going to get assaulted for saying this.

4324
03:56:22.08 --> 03:56:25.92
But one group will come after me with celery sticks and the other group will come after

4325
03:56:25.92 --> 03:56:28.56
me with raw meat.

4326
03:56:28.56 --> 03:56:32.96
But all I can say is, you do you and I love those guys.

4327
03:56:32.96 --> 03:56:36.40
I'll keep going the way I'm going and we'll see how it goes.

4328
03:56:36.40 --> 03:56:42.52
I like the fact that you said you have vegan friends.

4329
03:56:42.52 --> 03:56:48.88
You mentioned sugar, the habit of sugar, and you don't take much sugar anymore.

4330
03:56:48.88 --> 03:56:56.12
And you know, what are the podcasts that you've done is about habits, making habits, breaking

4331
03:56:56.12 --> 03:57:04.76
habits, give us some high level, habit forming and habit breaking neurological strategies

4332
03:57:04.76 --> 03:57:06.08
we can utilize.

4333
03:57:06.08 --> 03:57:11.48
Well, we've already talked about how dopamine puts you into an action state and the

4334
03:57:11.48 --> 03:57:18.16
serotonin system tends to bias you toward a more sedative state or calm state.

4335
03:57:18.16 --> 03:57:22.000
Maybe even a more creative state, which is associated with calm states.

4336
03:57:22.000 --> 03:57:26.68
If you were trying to build habits and you look to the neuroscience of habit building,

4337
03:57:26.68 --> 03:57:30.76
you would be wise to put certain habits at the early part of the day and certain habits

4338
03:57:30.76 --> 03:57:32.20
at the later part of the day.

4339
03:57:32.20 --> 03:57:37.96
I call phase one of the day from zero to nine hours after waking.

4340
03:57:37.96 --> 03:57:41.60
That period of the day assuming that you're getting that sunlight exposure and a little

4341
03:57:41.60 --> 03:57:42.60
bit of movement.

4342
03:57:42.60 --> 03:57:46.52
But even if you're just getting some sunlight exposure, it's going to be associated with

4343
03:57:46.52 --> 03:57:52.76
high up and effort and high dopamine, slightly higher cortisol.

4344
03:57:52.76 --> 03:57:55.20
Certain habits, we could call linear habits.

4345
03:57:55.20 --> 03:57:59.76
It's the, these are things that you know how to do and you just need to do them.

4346
03:57:59.76 --> 03:58:03.88
Other habits and so those sorts of habits would go well in that zero to nine hours

4347
03:58:03.88 --> 03:58:07.68
period that I call phase one, zero to nine hours after waking phase one.

4348
03:58:07.68 --> 03:58:12.96
Then phase two and these aren't absolute phases, but go from about 10 hours till about

4349
03:58:12.96 --> 03:58:15.40
16 or 17 hours after waking.

4350
03:58:15.40 --> 03:58:17.44
We tend to be a little bit sleepier.

4351
03:58:17.44 --> 03:58:20.76
We tend to be a little bit calmer, at least not necessarily sleepy.

4352
03:58:20.76 --> 03:58:22.88
I'm going to be a little bit calmer.

4353
03:58:22.88 --> 03:58:27.24
It's clear that other habits that have to do with what we call nonlinear brain operations,

4354
03:58:27.24 --> 03:58:32.44
things like creative writing, brainstorming with a group, brainstorming with yourself,

4355
03:58:32.44 --> 03:58:36.24
and a litic work that is where there is no clear right answer.

4356
03:58:36.24 --> 03:58:37.64
It's not plug and shug.

4357
03:58:37.64 --> 03:58:40.20
It's more exploratory.

4358
03:58:40.20 --> 03:58:44.44
Go best in the second phase, phase two.

4359
03:58:44.44 --> 03:58:46.88
I've been with seeing about rolling jiu-jitsu earlier.

4360
03:58:46.88 --> 03:58:49.28
I have a, I can't even call it rolling jiu-jitsu.

4361
03:58:49.28 --> 03:58:54.04
We've only done it once, but clearly there's a lot of moment to moment creativity and sorting

4362
03:58:54.04 --> 03:58:55.04
things out.

4363
03:58:55.04 --> 03:58:56.92
Whereas weightlifting, it sets and reps.

4364
03:58:56.92 --> 03:58:58.84
You're trying to complete a certain amount of sets and reps.

4365
03:58:58.84 --> 03:59:01.000
You're trying to cover a certain amount of distance running.

4366
03:59:01.000 --> 03:59:03.40
Linear versus nonlinear.

4367
03:59:03.40 --> 03:59:08.52
Then of course there's the 17 to 24 hours, which is phase three.

4368
03:59:08.52 --> 03:59:12.96
During that time, you want to be engaging one set of habits, which is sleep.

4369
03:59:12.96 --> 03:59:16.44
Roughly, it could be 16 to 24 hours, et cetera.

4370
03:59:16.44 --> 03:59:20.52
Try and put the habits you're trying to form into the times of day in which those will

4371
03:59:20.52 --> 03:59:21.84
actually be easiest.

4372
03:59:21.84 --> 03:59:25.92
This sort of violates the earlier rule of trying to access limbic friction.

4373
03:59:25.92 --> 03:59:29.40
If there's something that you're really trying to adopt more exercise and that exercise

4374
03:59:29.40 --> 03:59:32.48
is running a certain distance in a certain amount of time, put that in the early part

4375
03:59:32.48 --> 03:59:33.48
of the day.

4376
03:59:33.48 --> 03:59:38.32
If you're trying to do creative work, doing the second part of the day, if you are trying

4377
03:59:38.32 --> 03:59:42.20
to develop a new skill that's exploratory, second part of the day, if you're trying to

4378
03:59:42.20 --> 03:59:46.76
learn a skill that has defined steps already, it's linear early part of the day, people

4379
03:59:46.76 --> 03:59:51.44
will just find that it's simpler to do it in that fashion.

4380
03:59:51.44 --> 03:59:56.36
The other thing is that if you look at the signs of goal setting, there are clear data

4381
03:59:56.36 --> 04:00:00.84
that there's a woman at New York University, Emily Balkettis, or Balsettis, I think,

4382
04:00:00.84 --> 04:00:05.16
is the correct pronunciation.

4383
04:00:05.16 --> 04:00:11.16
She's described that while we like to think about envisioning success as the best way

4384
04:00:11.16 --> 04:00:16.04
to set goals and develop new habits, it turns out the research shows that it's far more

4385
04:00:16.04 --> 04:00:20.96
effective to imagine the catastrophic effects of failure.

4386
04:00:20.96 --> 04:00:27.20
It's the darkness none of us want to embrace, but fear is the more powerful motivator.

4387
04:00:27.20 --> 04:00:31.000
Provided you can still think clearly, you don't want to put yourself into a state of panic.

4388
04:00:31.000 --> 04:00:36.36
goal setting of if I don't do this every day, I'm looking at diabetes and early death,

4389
04:00:36.36 --> 04:00:40.08
is going to be a much more powerful motivator than imagining you're going, oh, I'm going

4390
04:00:40.08 --> 04:00:46.84
to be 10 pounds lighter and I can bench press 15% more by Christmas this time of year.

4391
04:00:46.84 --> 04:00:52.36
It's great to have goals, it's also great to have motivators that are based on real world

4392
04:00:52.36 --> 04:00:53.36
fear.

4393
04:00:53.36 --> 04:00:54.36
Fear.

4394
04:00:54.36 --> 04:00:55.36
Fear.

4395
04:00:55.36 --> 04:00:57.36
That's what the data say.

4396
04:00:57.36 --> 04:01:03.88
I was having a conversation with the bodymind that's at a big medical company and we were,

4397
04:01:03.88 --> 04:01:07.96
I was saying, oh, you know, when my, when my, I was kind of, I was kind of professing guilt

4398
04:01:07.96 --> 04:01:12.20
because when my kids were younger, you know, I did say, oh, you know, can we get some ice

4399
04:01:12.20 --> 04:01:18.76
cream and I took sure you want some type two diabetes, go with it, but this dude, no kidding

4400
04:01:18.76 --> 04:01:26.20
would have like needles and hat like stick the kids so that they could get used to get

4401
04:01:26.20 --> 04:01:27.20
it.

4402
04:01:27.20 --> 04:01:28.60
Oh, you, you want to have some ice cream cool.

4403
04:01:28.60 --> 04:01:29.60
Go get the needle.

4404
04:01:29.60 --> 04:01:32.80
We're going to, we're going to stick your fingers so that when you have type two diabetes,

4405
04:01:32.80 --> 04:01:34.76
you have to do an insulin draw.

4406
04:01:34.76 --> 04:01:35.76
Oh, I get this.

4407
04:01:35.76 --> 04:01:38.76
I was like, I was like, man, I'm just doing one up to me.

4408
04:01:38.76 --> 04:01:40.52
I don't get one up that often.

4409
04:01:40.52 --> 04:01:44.20
I'm going to come to be in stupid, but it's even a pull it off.

4410
04:01:44.20 --> 04:01:45.56
That's intense.

4411
04:01:45.56 --> 04:01:50.76
The dive guy can't comment on parenting.

4412
04:01:50.76 --> 04:01:54.32
We should also recall the dopamine reward system.

4413
04:01:54.32 --> 04:02:00.24
The best way to reward yourself for a job well done is random intermittent reward.

4414
04:02:00.24 --> 04:02:03.80
We've always talked up until now or we've been talking up until now that, you know,

4415
04:02:03.80 --> 04:02:05.60
effort reward is the cycle.

4416
04:02:05.60 --> 04:02:12.56
That cycle, effort reward, but if you want to keep remember dopamine, non-infinite, but

4417
04:02:12.56 --> 04:02:15.20
replenishable, how about not spend it at all?

4418
04:02:15.20 --> 04:02:19.52
How about use what the casinos use in order to keep yourself into a state of motivation?

4419
04:02:19.52 --> 04:02:24.84
So if you are checking off the boxes, I did this behavior, this new habit, that new habit,

4420
04:02:24.84 --> 04:02:26.60
that new habit, that new upgrade, do that.

4421
04:02:26.60 --> 04:02:28.88
But don't celebrate every win.

4422
04:02:28.88 --> 04:02:32.72
Celebrate random intermittent wins.

4423
04:02:32.72 --> 04:02:36.36
Celebrate, so how do you do that if you're in control of it?

4424
04:02:36.36 --> 04:02:41.96
Well, don't reward yourself with external rewards very often.

4425
04:02:41.96 --> 04:02:43.60
Make the training its own reward.

4426
04:02:43.60 --> 04:02:47.08
If it's I'm going to train and then I'm going to have the pancake breakfast.

4427
04:02:47.08 --> 04:02:48.08
Great.

4428
04:02:48.08 --> 04:02:51.68
Do it every once in a while, but don't do it every Sunday, don't do it every workout.

4429
04:02:51.68 --> 04:02:57.36
It's not so much about the frequency as much as it is, how the pattern, what we call

4430
04:02:57.36 --> 04:03:00.24
the schedule of reward.

4431
04:03:00.24 --> 04:03:03.60
You can see this in sports teams and some of the challenges over the years of everyone

4432
04:03:03.60 --> 04:03:04.60
gets a trophy.

4433
04:03:04.60 --> 04:03:09.40
I mean, nothing is more undermining to the dopamine system than that idea.

4434
04:03:09.40 --> 04:03:15.52
I mean, I don't know what happened with that, but I don't want to punish anybody because

4435
04:03:15.52 --> 04:03:20.12
I also don't know who it was, but that group or person who made that decision that everyone

4436
04:03:20.12 --> 04:03:26.28
gets a trophy clearly did not reap the literature about how the neuroscience of reward

4437
04:03:26.28 --> 04:03:27.96
and the psychology of reward works.

4438
04:03:27.96 --> 04:03:33.08
You actually diminish the role of rewards in every way and you take away the ability

4439
04:03:33.08 --> 04:03:35.44
to access the reward system in the future.

4440
04:03:35.44 --> 04:03:39.12
You're creating, you're not creating soft versions of people.

4441
04:03:39.12 --> 04:03:42.96
You're actually creating people, they're just like the rat with no dopamine.

4442
04:03:42.96 --> 04:03:44.72
It's a really sad state.

4443
04:03:44.72 --> 04:03:46.20
We have a name for that in humans.

4444
04:03:46.20 --> 04:03:47.68
It's called Parkinson's.

4445
04:03:47.68 --> 04:03:49.20
You deplete the dopamine system.

4446
04:03:49.20 --> 04:03:50.20
People get shaky.

4447
04:03:50.20 --> 04:03:51.20
They can't move.

4448
04:03:51.20 --> 04:03:55.20
That's in the motor system, but people with Parkinson's also experience extreme lack of motivation

4449
04:03:55.20 --> 04:03:57.64
and depression because of lack of dopamine.

4450
04:03:57.64 --> 04:04:03.36
That's the characteristic feature of Parkinson's, as lack of dopamine neurons.

4451
04:04:03.36 --> 04:04:08.08
You want to, everyone's in a while, reward yourself for reaching a goal.

4452
04:04:08.08 --> 04:04:11.44
One way to do this and that we've structured on the podcast, but I can just describe really

4453
04:04:11.44 --> 04:04:19.04
easily, is set three or four habits that you want to create for yourself in a list of six.

4454
04:04:19.04 --> 04:04:22.60
So find six habits and decide every day you're going to do four.

4455
04:04:22.60 --> 04:04:24.28
But never compensate day to day.

4456
04:04:24.28 --> 04:04:25.28
There's reasons for doing this.

4457
04:04:25.28 --> 04:04:30.28
Let's say one day it's trained if you're not really run, if you're not already doing that.

4458
04:04:30.28 --> 04:04:34.16
Right, if you're not already doing that, you can list these off.

4459
04:04:34.16 --> 04:04:37.20
Grattitude practice, NSTR, and then let's just come up with one.

4460
04:04:37.20 --> 04:04:39.60
I don't know, eat a vegetable or just making these up.

4461
04:04:39.60 --> 04:04:42.16
So you're going to list those out on your calendar.

4462
04:04:42.16 --> 04:04:45.88
And then every day you're going to do it least four, but as many as five.

4463
04:04:45.88 --> 04:04:52.28
But if one day you only get one, you don't carry over and do 10 the next day.

4464
04:04:52.28 --> 04:04:55.04
If you understand the dopamine system, you'll understand why.

4465
04:04:55.04 --> 04:04:57.96
Because what you're trying to do is you're trying to train up a circuitry for giving

4466
04:04:57.96 --> 04:05:02.16
yourself random intermittent reward for performing these habits on a regular basis.

4467
04:05:02.16 --> 04:05:06.80
So people will go do these heroic workouts or they'll do a ton of stuff and then reward

4468
04:05:06.80 --> 04:05:10.28
themselves and they've just undermined the whole process of being able to do that consistently.

4469
04:05:10.28 --> 04:05:12.48
If that wasn't clear, it's a little complicated.

4470
04:05:12.48 --> 04:05:16.92
But the way that reward schedules work is you're trying to teach the circuitry to work

4471
04:05:16.92 --> 04:05:21.84
regularly be rewarded only every once in a while and at random.

4472
04:05:21.84 --> 04:05:29.92
So if you were technically going to do this, I would have to make a bucket with a bunch

4473
04:05:29.92 --> 04:05:35.36
of ping pong balls in it and most of the ping pong balls didn't have anything on them.

4474
04:05:35.36 --> 04:05:41.80
But then some of the ping pong balls had chocolate chip cookie perfect.

4475
04:05:41.80 --> 04:05:46.12
And then every time I get done with my workout, I'm like, hey, I did the workout.

4476
04:05:46.12 --> 04:05:47.12
I did a good job.

4477
04:05:47.12 --> 04:05:49.88
I'm going to grab a ping pong ball from the bucket.

4478
04:05:49.88 --> 04:05:50.88
Nothing.

4479
04:05:50.88 --> 04:05:51.88
Next day.

4480
04:05:51.88 --> 04:05:52.88
Nothing.

4481
04:05:52.88 --> 04:05:53.88
Next day.

4482
04:05:53.88 --> 04:05:54.88
Next day.

4483
04:05:54.88 --> 04:05:55.88
Chocolate chip cookie.

4484
04:05:55.88 --> 04:05:58.44
That's what I would have to technically do.

4485
04:05:58.44 --> 04:06:01.64
But I had to do the workout to pull one of these things out of the bucket.

4486
04:06:01.64 --> 04:06:02.64
Perfect.

4487
04:06:02.64 --> 04:06:08.12
And how many rewards to put in that bucket versus how many blank ping pong balls, you

4488
04:06:08.12 --> 04:06:11.20
could say maybe one third of them should have a reward.

4489
04:06:11.20 --> 04:06:13.12
But remember, it's random.

4490
04:06:13.12 --> 04:06:16.52
And so that exactly describes the way we would do an experiment on an animal or human

4491
04:06:16.52 --> 04:06:17.92
in our laboratory.

4492
04:06:17.92 --> 04:06:20.32
And then with humans, we do it in a very particular way.

4493
04:06:20.32 --> 04:06:22.96
We actually pay them real money.

4494
04:06:22.96 --> 04:06:25.16
We have people do hard work for money.

4495
04:06:25.16 --> 04:06:27.16
Very amounts of money.

4496
04:06:27.16 --> 04:06:28.36
Often.

4497
04:06:28.36 --> 04:06:30.60
And you can record from the brain.

4498
04:06:30.60 --> 04:06:32.64
You can record from dopamine centers or other centers.

4499
04:06:32.64 --> 04:06:36.16
What happens is people start trying to create the most rational strategy.

4500
04:06:36.16 --> 04:06:39.84
You get these maniacs that will just try and get as many reps as possible.

4501
04:06:39.84 --> 04:06:43.72
This is not a discussion about learning and plasticity.

4502
04:06:43.72 --> 04:06:49.48
You may get into that. But it's very clear that errors or the anticipation of a reward

4503
04:06:49.48 --> 04:06:53.92
and then no reward, while it leads to disappointment, it also increases attention and the

4504
04:06:53.92 --> 04:06:56.000
ability to focus on the next trial.

4505
04:06:56.000 --> 04:06:57.000
Think about this.

4506
04:06:57.000 --> 04:06:58.24
What do you guys call it behind glass?

4507
04:06:58.24 --> 04:06:59.24
You're shooting.

4508
04:06:59.24 --> 04:07:00.24
Writing.

4509
04:07:00.24 --> 04:07:01.24
You're missing.

4510
04:07:01.24 --> 04:07:04.16
Every time you miss, the next trial is the one you're paying the most attention to.

4511
04:07:04.16 --> 04:07:06.32
When you hit, you think, oh, the next one I'm good.

4512
04:07:06.32 --> 04:07:07.32
No, the next one.

4513
04:07:07.32 --> 04:07:08.72
Why would you be good?

4514
04:07:08.72 --> 04:07:10.92
Why would you just succeed it?

4515
04:07:10.92 --> 04:07:13.64
Why would your nervous system pay attention to what happens next?

4516
04:07:13.64 --> 04:07:17.64
When you succeed, your nervous system goes, oh, that happened that way and it's a little

4517
04:07:17.64 --> 04:07:18.64
relaxation.

4518
04:07:18.64 --> 04:07:19.64
It's a little relaxation.

4519
04:07:19.64 --> 04:07:22.28
So errors we know, queue up the forebrain.

4520
04:07:22.28 --> 04:07:24.24
It increases activity in the prefrontal cortex.

4521
04:07:24.24 --> 04:07:25.64
You're only done this.

4522
04:07:25.64 --> 04:07:28.64
I don't get behind glass, but I've thrown darts in a bar.

4523
04:07:28.64 --> 04:07:29.64
You're up there.

4524
04:07:29.64 --> 04:07:32.44
There are people watching and you're used to do this in graduate school.

4525
04:07:32.44 --> 04:07:36.64
This is a little bar in Davis and we throw darts and you miss.

4526
04:07:36.64 --> 04:07:40.84
You're really, it's almost that little anger and the next one you're completely dialed in.

4527
04:07:40.84 --> 04:07:45.16
But then you're like bulls eye, bulls eye, off the, off the, ah.

4528
04:07:45.16 --> 04:07:48.76
And when you make it the next one, you're not paying as careful attention to your motor

4529
04:07:48.76 --> 04:07:49.76
patterns.

4530
04:07:49.76 --> 04:07:51.84
So you might get lucky, but you're not learning.

4531
04:07:51.84 --> 04:07:56.80
So errors are key to learning and the proper ratio of errors to successful trials for

4532
04:07:56.80 --> 04:08:00.52
optimal learning is very clear from machine learning and from human learning is the 85

4533
04:08:00.52 --> 04:08:02.28
15 rule.

4534
04:08:02.28 --> 04:08:06.92
The how difficult to make a task should be 85% of the time you're performing it correctly,

4535
04:08:06.92 --> 04:08:09.72
15% of the time you're performing it incorrectly.

4536
04:08:09.72 --> 04:08:11.52
Or or less, plus or minus 2%.

4537
04:08:11.52 --> 04:08:18.12
If you want to optimize learning 85% you get it 15% you miss.

4538
04:08:18.12 --> 04:08:21.92
Yeah, that's about the right level of difficulty for motor skill learning, cognitive learning,

4539
04:08:21.92 --> 04:08:22.92
et cetera.

4540
04:08:22.92 --> 04:08:27.72
Any more than that is you're putting too much of a demand on the attentional systems.

4541
04:08:27.72 --> 04:08:30.92
Any less you're putting too little demand on the attentional systems.

4542
04:08:30.92 --> 04:08:32.92
That's what the machine learning shows in humans.

4543
04:08:32.92 --> 04:08:36.72
That's what the machine learning algorithm is based on human learning.

4544
04:08:36.72 --> 04:08:38.52
That's what the animal data show.

4545
04:08:38.52 --> 04:08:42.44
Of course, there'll be some variation on this, but if people are saying, oh, I want

4546
04:08:42.44 --> 04:08:46.40
to teach these kids Spanish, why I want to teach people how to shoot.

4547
04:08:46.40 --> 04:08:53.000
Well, make it difficult enough so that there are about 15% error rate.

4548
04:08:53.000 --> 04:08:54.000
Or GJ2, I guess.

4549
04:08:54.000 --> 04:08:56.76
Well, GJ2, unfortunately, we start GJ2.

4550
04:08:56.76 --> 04:08:59.60
You're getting 100% error rate because you get tapped out all the time.

4551
04:08:59.60 --> 04:09:04.24
That's why it takes a lot of effort to get over the hump in the beginning.

4552
04:09:04.24 --> 04:09:08.64
Look, we've been going for a while.

4553
04:09:08.64 --> 04:09:14.60
I do want to, you've touched on this a little bit, but before we wrap and I can already tell

4554
04:09:14.60 --> 04:09:19.84
if you're okay with it, hopefully we can do some more podcasts in the future.

4555
04:09:19.84 --> 04:09:22.000
I'd love to have you on my podcast.

4556
04:09:22.000 --> 04:09:23.000
I'd love to.

4557
04:09:23.000 --> 04:09:25.12
Yeah, sit down and chat with you guys and need time.

4558
04:09:25.12 --> 04:09:26.96
Let's do it.

4559
04:09:26.96 --> 04:09:28.32
Let's get people ready for bed.

4560
04:09:28.32 --> 04:09:29.32
Ready for sleep.

4561
04:09:29.32 --> 04:09:34.20
You've already talked about what we're doing, what our temperature's doing, how

4562
04:09:34.20 --> 04:09:37.88
we get ready for bed at the end of the day.

4563
04:09:37.88 --> 04:09:41.44
After our three bouts of work, I've always called them a day.

4564
04:09:41.44 --> 04:09:42.44
Dude, that's legit.

4565
04:09:42.44 --> 04:09:44.08
I'm in, you know, you've got to have that.

4566
04:09:44.08 --> 04:09:45.24
It's a mindset thing, right?

4567
04:09:45.24 --> 04:09:48.88
You're like, okay, I need to get rid of getting a game.

4568
04:09:48.88 --> 04:09:49.88
Forward center of mass.

4569
04:09:49.88 --> 04:09:50.88
Yeah, so.

4570
04:09:50.88 --> 04:09:57.68
If you sit down and try, if you sit down to any cognitive task and or physical task and

4571
04:09:57.68 --> 04:10:00.88
pray for focus, can we be praying along to?

4572
04:10:00.88 --> 04:10:01.92
It just doesn't work that way.

4573
04:10:01.92 --> 04:10:04.88
The brain needs, you need to recruit the attentionals.

4574
04:10:04.88 --> 04:10:05.88
We're doing this.

4575
04:10:05.88 --> 04:10:06.88
Yeah.

4576
04:10:06.88 --> 04:10:08.40
We really need to recruit the attentionals systems.

4577
04:10:08.40 --> 04:10:15.76
And I get concerned about people trying to leverage too many tools, even though

4578
04:10:15.76 --> 04:10:17.88
I talk about a lot of tools.

4579
04:10:17.88 --> 04:10:23.24
At some point, you've got the work that you're there, caffeinated, you're hydrated as

4580
04:10:23.24 --> 04:10:26.08
you would say, go, shut up and go.

4581
04:10:26.08 --> 04:10:28.92
When I write books, we're done written a couple.

4582
04:10:28.92 --> 04:10:31.20
I write a thousand words a day.

4583
04:10:31.20 --> 04:10:33.16
It takes about an hour.

4584
04:10:33.16 --> 04:10:36.48
And I rarely will write more than that.

4585
04:10:36.48 --> 04:10:40.24
I almost never miss once I'm in the zone and I got a book.

4586
04:10:40.24 --> 04:10:42.36
I won't miss, but that's it.

4587
04:10:42.36 --> 04:10:47.16
I like the attitude of going in of, hey, this is about like I'm about to go get it on.

4588
04:10:47.16 --> 04:10:49.64
And I need to just bring the heat for an hour.

4589
04:10:49.64 --> 04:10:50.64
And I like that.

4590
04:10:50.64 --> 04:10:51.64
That's a good idea.

4591
04:10:51.64 --> 04:10:53.76
Yeah, I learned it in graduate school.

4592
04:10:53.76 --> 04:10:55.92
Cutting, there's this thing called a microtone where you take a brain.

4593
04:10:55.92 --> 04:10:56.92
It's frozen.

4594
04:10:56.92 --> 04:10:59.52
You slice it off like a deli slice or one little piece at a time.

4595
04:10:59.52 --> 04:11:01.52
And is this a Hannibal Lecter scenario?

4596
04:11:01.52 --> 04:11:05.12
Yeah, well, I have a lot of stories from the lab that since you guys are not afraid

4597
04:11:05.12 --> 04:11:07.16
of letting guts, you know, we can get into that.

4598
04:11:07.16 --> 04:11:11.000
But you're putting these little thin slices of tissue into these little wells of liquid.

4599
04:11:11.000 --> 04:11:12.16
And it's very delicate work.

4600
04:11:12.16 --> 04:11:15.36
And some of these specimens were very valuable either because they came from human beings

4601
04:11:15.36 --> 04:11:20.20
that had interesting experiences like the loss of one eye or something or because

4602
04:11:20.20 --> 04:11:23.52
the tissue had been created through a number of experiments that lasted months, if not

4603
04:11:23.52 --> 04:11:24.52
years.

4604
04:11:24.52 --> 04:11:25.52
So it's really important stuff.

4605
04:11:25.52 --> 04:11:29.56
And then what was taught to me by one of the perhaps the greatest neurophthalmologists

4606
04:11:29.56 --> 04:11:34.60
at UCSF Jonathan Horne, he said, the moment that microtone blade hits that tissue, a

4607
04:11:34.60 --> 04:11:36.72
nuclear bomb could go off in the building.

4608
04:11:36.72 --> 04:11:39.52
And you're not going to increase the speed of the pull because the slower you can pull

4609
04:11:39.52 --> 04:11:42.36
at the better of the quality of the tissue, but you can't stop.

4610
04:11:42.36 --> 04:11:44.64
And so I learned to just lay down through these brains.

4611
04:11:44.64 --> 04:11:48.16
And some people will put ice on it and go have lunch come back and it never quite cuts

4612
04:11:48.16 --> 04:11:49.40
right when you come back to it.

4613
04:11:49.40 --> 04:11:51.56
So how long would it take to a slice?

4614
04:11:51.56 --> 04:11:57.52
For a small mal-sprayin would take maybe an hour, you can get why did we not make a machine

4615
04:11:57.52 --> 04:11:58.52
that would do it?

4616
04:11:58.52 --> 04:12:01.96
The machines can't adjust the temperature and speed actually the way you adjust the

4617
04:12:01.96 --> 04:12:02.96
temperature.

4618
04:12:02.96 --> 04:12:03.96
Kids don't do this.

4619
04:12:03.96 --> 04:12:05.52
You're fingering, you put it on there and get it.

4620
04:12:05.52 --> 04:12:09.16
There's just a texture of like very cold butter that's just right.

4621
04:12:09.16 --> 04:12:10.16
It's a feel thing.

4622
04:12:10.16 --> 04:12:11.76
The machine will crack the tissue.

4623
04:12:11.76 --> 04:12:14.52
It doesn't know when it's screwing up.

4624
04:12:14.52 --> 04:12:18.36
So I've cut through my Kakamunki brains that took me somewhere between seven and eight

4625
04:12:18.36 --> 04:12:20.68
hours.

4626
04:12:20.68 --> 04:12:21.68
And it's a single pole.

4627
04:12:21.68 --> 04:12:27.20
As a sit well, when you're doing a pole and then repeating and then poking God or God.

4628
04:12:27.20 --> 04:12:32.48
Done that and I've done a whole human brain mediathe, done a block of a human frontal

4629
04:12:32.48 --> 04:12:36.64
cortex of all things and human retina where I think the longest have gone is something

4630
04:12:36.64 --> 04:12:38.52
like 11 hours of cutting.

4631
04:12:38.52 --> 04:12:42.24
And in that case, just to be clear about how this works, you've got a little bit of food

4632
04:12:42.24 --> 04:12:46.32
next to you, you've got your portable bathroom next to you.

4633
04:12:46.32 --> 04:12:50.56
Sometimes you have to urinate during these things, you handle it.

4634
04:12:50.56 --> 04:12:54.48
You typically do this alone in a room.

4635
04:12:54.48 --> 04:12:58.000
And you finish it off that thing and you get those things into tissue well.

4636
04:12:58.000 --> 04:12:59.80
And there's almost nothing is satisfying.

4637
04:12:59.80 --> 04:13:00.80
There are things more satisfying.

4638
04:13:00.80 --> 04:13:01.80
How's that going?

4639
04:13:01.80 --> 04:13:02.80
It's nice.

4640
04:13:02.80 --> 04:13:06.32
About anywhere from 20 to 40 microns.

4641
04:13:06.32 --> 04:13:09.08
So a millimeter is divided into 1,000 microns.

4642
04:13:09.08 --> 04:13:12.72
So credit cards 200 approximately 200 microns thick.

4643
04:13:12.72 --> 04:13:13.92
So very, very thin.

4644
04:13:13.92 --> 04:13:14.92
You can see through it.

4645
04:13:14.92 --> 04:13:15.92
It's translucent.

4646
04:13:15.92 --> 04:13:17.32
And it's so much fun.

4647
04:13:17.32 --> 04:13:19.44
And then you stain them and you put them under microscopes.

4648
04:13:19.44 --> 04:13:21.12
And I'm my career was built on this work too.

4649
04:13:21.12 --> 04:13:27.08
So you're also thinking about the, you're collecting the crops of your farm.

4650
04:13:27.08 --> 04:13:28.08
So to speak.

4651
04:13:28.08 --> 04:13:29.36
It's so pleasurable.

4652
04:13:29.36 --> 04:13:30.36
It really is.

4653
04:13:30.36 --> 04:13:33.88
You wouldn't get me third person personality, what were you calling it?

4654
04:13:33.88 --> 04:13:37.16
Where you wouldn't get any detachment when you're doing that kind of getting the zone?

4655
04:13:37.16 --> 04:13:40.20
I didn't really listen to audio books back then.

4656
04:13:40.20 --> 04:13:42.40
I would listen to a lot of rants.

4657
04:13:42.40 --> 04:13:45.36
Listen to a lot of Glenn Gould as a classical pianist.

4658
04:13:45.36 --> 04:13:48.000
If ever you need to do work and you want to listen to classical music and you're not

4659
04:13:48.000 --> 04:13:54.24
really into classical music, Glenn Gould is just perfect for that background brain state.

4660
04:13:54.24 --> 04:13:56.36
And just an amazing piano player.

4661
04:13:56.36 --> 04:13:58.52
So I would do that.

4662
04:13:58.52 --> 04:14:04.24
And so I guess the point is that we can train ourselves to focus and it feels so good.

4663
04:14:04.24 --> 04:14:08.68
It reminds me of my bulldog chewing on something.

4664
04:14:08.68 --> 04:14:12.08
And you know, I'm going to, I wasn't going to reveal this.

4665
04:14:12.08 --> 04:14:14.20
When I got him, I got him from a guy named Elvis.

4666
04:14:14.20 --> 04:14:15.88
So I named him to Costello.

4667
04:14:15.88 --> 04:14:18.48
But there was a moment because this was about the zone.

4668
04:14:18.48 --> 04:14:21.32
I thought about naming him, Jocco.

4669
04:14:21.32 --> 04:14:23.72
Because you guys both have big necks.

4670
04:14:23.72 --> 04:14:28.72
So the anyway, it's, I got him earlier.

4671
04:14:28.72 --> 04:14:29.72
But there was always this question.

4672
04:14:29.72 --> 04:14:31.20
Do we keep Costello as his name?

4673
04:14:31.20 --> 04:14:33.28
Because I didn't name him as someone who said it.

4674
04:14:33.28 --> 04:14:34.52
And I was like, maybe we keep Costello.

4675
04:14:34.52 --> 04:14:37.84
Anyway, there was a debate in our household at one point.

4676
04:14:37.84 --> 04:14:38.84
Costello won out.

4677
04:14:38.84 --> 04:14:39.84
Sorry.

4678
04:14:39.84 --> 04:14:40.84
Good.

4679
04:14:40.84 --> 04:14:42.44
But hey, someone out there has named their dog Jocco.

4680
04:14:42.44 --> 04:14:44.44
And hopefully it's because they have a thick neck.

4681
04:14:44.44 --> 04:14:47.20
There's quite a few dogs out there named Jocco.

4682
04:14:47.20 --> 04:14:48.68
There's a couple kids out there named Jocco.

4683
04:14:48.68 --> 04:14:50.08
There's some police dogs out there named Jocco.

4684
04:14:50.08 --> 04:14:51.08
Are there Jocco tattoos?

4685
04:14:51.08 --> 04:14:52.08
Yes.

4686
04:14:52.08 --> 04:14:54.24
There are some Jocco tattoos out there in the world.

4687
04:14:54.24 --> 04:14:57.84
Yeah, if you talk about, people get good for a tattoo.

4688
04:14:57.84 --> 04:14:58.84
People get this one.

4689
04:14:58.84 --> 04:14:59.84
It was free to them for a tattoo.

4690
04:14:59.84 --> 04:15:00.84
It was a pretty cool.

4691
04:15:00.84 --> 04:15:01.84
Yeah.

4692
04:15:01.84 --> 04:15:03.04
So some of that stuff going on.

4693
04:15:03.04 --> 04:15:06.96
Anyway, did it, has anyone gotten any, you know, who grew them in lab?

4694
04:15:06.96 --> 04:15:07.96
Tats yet?

4695
04:15:07.96 --> 04:15:08.96
Not that I'm aware of.

4696
04:15:08.96 --> 04:15:12.84
But I will say this, if anyone gets a tattoo of Lex Friedman's face, I'll be happy to have

4697
04:15:12.84 --> 04:15:16.68
a one hour zoom with you to discuss any topic in the world side and see you on.

4698
04:15:16.68 --> 04:15:21.68
So if anyone wants to get a neck tattoo of Lex Friedman's face, then we'll do it two hours

4699
04:15:21.68 --> 04:15:22.68
zoom.

4700
04:15:22.68 --> 04:15:23.68
I was on Lex's podcast.

4701
04:15:23.68 --> 04:15:25.68
Please don't put it.

4702
04:15:25.68 --> 04:15:26.68
He's tough.

4703
04:15:26.68 --> 04:15:28.28
I was on Lex's podcast.

4704
04:15:28.28 --> 04:15:31.88
And it was an interesting interaction we'll say.

4705
04:15:31.88 --> 04:15:33.36
And he's an awesome guy.

4706
04:15:33.36 --> 04:15:35.08
It was just like, I don't know.

4707
04:15:35.08 --> 04:15:36.08
It was a little strange.

4708
04:15:36.08 --> 04:15:39.08
But and somebody actually nailed it.

4709
04:15:39.08 --> 04:15:46.36
They said, this is like the Terminator from the second Terminator movie, interviewing the

4710
04:15:46.36 --> 04:15:48.84
Terminator from the first Terminator movie.

4711
04:15:48.84 --> 04:15:52.84
Because he was asking me to go questions and I was giving him like one word answers

4712
04:15:52.84 --> 04:15:53.84
for whatever.

4713
04:15:53.84 --> 04:15:56.000
It took a while to get like a flowed garden.

4714
04:15:56.000 --> 04:15:58.000
You know, it's kind of flooded.

4715
04:15:58.000 --> 04:15:59.000
He's a good friend of mine.

4716
04:15:59.000 --> 04:16:00.000
I, yeah.

4717
04:16:00.000 --> 04:16:01.76
So I know, I want to do it again.

4718
04:16:01.76 --> 04:16:06.84
I want to, I want to, I got to do his podcast again where we, where we have a little bit

4719
04:16:06.84 --> 04:16:08.60
of a, because now I kind of know him.

4720
04:16:08.60 --> 04:16:12.72
And we've had some other, we actually, the last time I talked him on the phone, we were actually

4721
04:16:12.72 --> 04:16:14.88
just laughing our asses off about a couple of things.

4722
04:16:14.88 --> 04:16:17.76
That was one of the things I told him, hey, I read this comment about where do you, where

4723
04:16:17.76 --> 04:16:20.92
the interviewer be, and he was just laughing because he was so accurate.

4724
04:16:20.92 --> 04:16:21.92
It was got a funny.

4725
04:16:21.92 --> 04:16:23.36
Maybe he actually rolled you, Jitsu.

4726
04:16:23.36 --> 04:16:24.36
Yeah, yeah.

4727
04:16:24.36 --> 04:16:25.36
You can just settle it out.

4728
04:16:25.36 --> 04:16:26.36
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4729
04:16:26.36 --> 04:16:27.36
Yeah, yeah.

4730
04:16:27.36 --> 04:16:29.20
Just what, I don't think there was any friction, but maybe you guys just have you rolled

4731
04:16:29.20 --> 04:16:30.20
you, Jitsu.

4732
04:16:30.20 --> 04:16:32.04
No, no, there wasn't any friction.

4733
04:16:32.04 --> 04:16:38.28
It was just, I think, you know, he, he started off with some question, like, are you

4734
04:16:38.28 --> 04:16:39.28
afraid of death?

4735
04:16:39.28 --> 04:16:40.28
I'm like, no.

4736
04:16:40.28 --> 04:16:44.28
And he got away from there.

4737
04:16:44.28 --> 04:16:48.64
I was like, okay, you know, if you, he's like, you want to expand on that.

4738
04:16:48.64 --> 04:16:50.72
I'm like, I am not afraid of death.

4739
04:16:50.72 --> 04:16:53.28
Whatever it was, but it was funny.

4740
04:16:53.28 --> 04:16:56.84
It sounded funny afterwards when I listened to it.

4741
04:16:56.84 --> 04:16:59.28
I was like, man, why, I don't know what happened.

4742
04:16:59.28 --> 04:17:00.28
I listened to that podcast.

4743
04:17:00.28 --> 04:17:01.28
I really enjoyed it.

4744
04:17:01.28 --> 04:17:07.08
Yeah, anyway, like I said, and I, I really like Lex and I really like his podcast.

4745
04:17:07.08 --> 04:17:11.000
And yeah, and the other funny thing is we were kind of chilling.

4746
04:17:11.000 --> 04:17:16.68
Like we met, was in LA, we're talking, you know, we're just talking and we sit down.

4747
04:17:16.68 --> 04:17:17.68
And that was another thing.

4748
04:17:17.68 --> 04:17:20.96
It kind of, like we're just talking like whatever.

4749
04:17:20.96 --> 04:17:24.60
And then all of a sudden he's like, and he doesn't, he goes to making eye contact with

4750
04:17:24.60 --> 04:17:25.60
me.

4751
04:17:25.60 --> 04:17:26.60
And he goes, are you afraid of death?

4752
04:17:26.60 --> 04:17:30.32
Like just, we're talking about whatever, and he goes, are you afraid of death?

4753
04:17:30.32 --> 04:17:32.60
And I was like, no.

4754
04:17:32.60 --> 04:17:37.16
And then I guess that was the start of the podcast.

4755
04:17:37.16 --> 04:17:38.40
That goes getting a kick out of the way.

4756
04:17:38.40 --> 04:17:39.40
Straight to the deep end.

4757
04:17:39.40 --> 04:17:40.40
So true.

4758
04:17:40.40 --> 04:17:41.40
That's right.

4759
04:17:41.40 --> 04:17:42.40
That's right.

4760
04:17:42.40 --> 04:17:44.40
So I, Lex, you guys should do it again.

4761
04:17:44.40 --> 04:17:45.40
You guys have to.

4762
04:17:45.40 --> 04:17:46.40
Who knows?

4763
04:17:46.40 --> 04:17:47.40
Maybe.

4764
04:17:47.40 --> 04:17:51.96
I'm sure I'll get down to Austin at some point and hook it up.

4765
04:17:51.96 --> 04:17:54.40
Talk to, talk to Lex again.

4766
04:17:54.40 --> 04:17:58.32
And hopefully I can be, this is by the way, this is just like, because I was just, I don't

4767
04:17:58.32 --> 04:17:59.92
know, I don't know what, what I messed up.

4768
04:17:59.92 --> 04:18:00.92
But I'll do better.

4769
04:18:00.92 --> 04:18:02.36
I'll do better next time.

4770
04:18:02.36 --> 04:18:05.56
I won't be, I won't be like a Terminator robot.

4771
04:18:05.56 --> 04:18:07.000
I guess I'll try not to be.

4772
04:18:07.000 --> 04:18:10.28
Maybe what your response about the death question will be the same.

4773
04:18:10.28 --> 04:18:13.88
Yeah, my response about the death question will be the same, you know, and are you

4774
04:18:13.88 --> 04:18:14.88
afraid of death?

4775
04:18:14.88 --> 04:18:15.88
No.

4776
04:18:15.88 --> 04:18:21.88
We're talking about, definitely, not exactly what they're there.

4777
04:18:21.88 --> 04:18:24.24
Yeah.

4778
04:18:24.24 --> 04:18:26.24
So back to sleep.

4779
04:18:26.24 --> 04:18:27.24
Yeah.

4780
04:18:27.24 --> 04:18:28.24
To win this.

4781
04:18:28.24 --> 04:18:31.16
To win this initial podcast up.

4782
04:18:31.16 --> 04:18:33.20
What do we, how we get ready for sleep?

4783
04:18:33.20 --> 04:18:34.80
OK.

4784
04:18:34.80 --> 04:18:37.56
View some sunlight in the afternoon before the sun goes down.

4785
04:18:37.56 --> 04:18:38.56
Why?

4786
04:18:38.56 --> 04:18:44.48
It adjusts your retinal sensitivity in a way that allows you to get, to view a little bit more

4787
04:18:44.48 --> 04:18:47.92
artificial light at night without disrupting your melatonin.

4788
04:18:47.92 --> 04:18:51.88
Beautiful study, published in scientific reports shows this.

4789
04:18:51.88 --> 04:18:56.96
It adjusts that sensitivity so that bright light from screens isn't going to really mess

4790
04:18:56.96 --> 04:18:57.96
you up quite as much.

4791
04:18:57.96 --> 04:19:00.48
I call it your Netflix and Osculation.

4792
04:19:00.48 --> 04:19:04.80
However, dim the lights in the evening, especially overhead lights.

4793
04:19:04.80 --> 04:19:07.92
These neurons in the eye that we were talking about before that set the circadian rhythm

4794
04:19:07.92 --> 04:19:12.12
and generate states of alertness, they're more or less in the lower half of your eye

4795
04:19:12.12 --> 04:19:14.08
and they view the upper visual field, make sense.

4796
04:19:14.08 --> 04:19:16.40
They're there to extract sunlight.

4797
04:19:16.40 --> 04:19:21.52
So if you're going to light your environment, which you should, obviously, you need to move

4798
04:19:21.52 --> 04:19:25.96
about, put lights, you know, use lamps or table lamps or if you want to get really

4799
04:19:25.96 --> 04:19:27.12
extreme stuff near the floor.

4800
04:19:27.12 --> 04:19:31.96
If you're really into this, you could get red bulbs and because red shifted light is

4801
04:19:31.96 --> 04:19:35.44
actually going to be less disruptive to your circadian rhythms.

4802
04:19:35.44 --> 04:19:39.84
In fact, there's a nice study looking at for shift workers, red light isn't going to increase

4803
04:19:39.84 --> 04:19:41.80
cortisol late in the day.

4804
04:19:41.80 --> 04:19:44.28
And shift work is something, obviously, thank you shift workers.

4805
04:19:44.28 --> 04:19:47.72
We realize that much of what we talked about, you can't access because you're doing the

4806
04:19:47.72 --> 04:19:50.000
important work at night that all of us depend on.

4807
04:19:50.000 --> 04:19:55.08
I have a whole episode on shift work that people can get tools for that, the long discussion.

4808
04:19:55.08 --> 04:20:00.12
So, dim the lights, set them low in the room, red lights if you're really extreme about

4809
04:20:00.12 --> 04:20:06.36
it, put on blue blockers if you do that sort of thing, but or just dim the lights.

4810
04:20:06.36 --> 04:20:08.32
Cool the environment.

4811
04:20:08.32 --> 04:20:12.68
In general, it's not good to fall asleep within two hours of eating a big meal, but

4812
04:20:12.68 --> 04:20:16.16
you'd be, if you can fall asleep, it's always good to get sleep.

4813
04:20:16.16 --> 04:20:20.28
So, you know, that some people are really neurotic about this, like I won't eat within

4814
04:20:20.28 --> 04:20:24.08
two hours of bedtime fine, but if you get home from work two hours late because of traffic

4815
04:20:24.08 --> 04:20:28.88
or you're going to not eat and then not sleep, I mean, just be a human.

4816
04:20:28.88 --> 04:20:33.88
Eat dinner and then try and give yourself a little bit of time before you go to sleep.

4817
04:20:33.88 --> 04:20:38.36
So, in all seriousness, I would hate to see people obsess too much.

4818
04:20:38.36 --> 04:20:42.24
Hydrate, but of course, don't drink a ton of fluid before going to sleep because there's

4819
04:20:42.24 --> 04:20:44.48
a direct circuit from the bladder to the brainstem.

4820
04:20:44.48 --> 04:20:47.08
This is why you wake up in the middle of the night because you have to go to the bathroom.

4821
04:20:47.08 --> 04:20:49.96
So, don't over-hydrate at night.

4822
04:20:49.96 --> 04:20:54.60
And if you do a hot bath or a sauna or something like that, obviously hydrate, but remember

4823
04:20:54.60 --> 04:20:59.72
that cool off after that will help drop your body temperature even further.

4824
04:20:59.72 --> 04:21:04.32
Then in terms of your sleep environment, there's a really nice paper that just came out

4825
04:21:04.32 --> 04:21:07.56
and proceeds to the National Academy of Sciences showing that people that sleep in a room

4826
04:21:07.56 --> 04:21:12.20
where there are ambient lights, there's lights on, even if they're pretty dim, some

4827
04:21:12.20 --> 04:21:17.68
of that light actually gets through the eyelids and disrupts metabolism and morning glucose

4828
04:21:17.68 --> 04:21:20.20
management and insulin secretion.

4829
04:21:20.20 --> 04:21:22.76
So try and keep your sleeping environment as dark as possible.

4830
04:21:22.76 --> 04:21:26.64
Don't obsess about one little light or something, but you've ever been the hotel with

4831
04:21:26.64 --> 04:21:29.64
a bright blue light, it's really annoying.

4832
04:21:29.64 --> 04:21:32.000
The one bright light in the corner.

4833
04:21:32.000 --> 04:21:33.000
Here's the other thing.

4834
04:21:33.000 --> 04:21:35.40
Some people like me have really thin eyelids, don't ask me why.

4835
04:21:35.40 --> 04:21:38.48
Some people have thick eyelids, so some people can see light through their eyelids more

4836
04:21:38.48 --> 04:21:39.48
than others.

4837
04:21:39.48 --> 04:21:44.36
Yeah, so where did I mask if you want to, but keep it dark.

4838
04:21:44.36 --> 04:21:46.20
There are a bunch of different things.

4839
04:21:46.20 --> 04:21:51.000
If you are the one really important thing that most people are not aware of is that work

4840
04:21:51.000 --> 04:21:55.88
from Chuck Sice's lab at Harvard Medical School has shown, we are Harvard, where's that?

4841
04:21:55.88 --> 04:21:57.68
Is this a little school in Boston?

4842
04:21:57.68 --> 04:22:00.60
They have a couple campuses and they have good people.

4843
04:22:00.60 --> 04:22:02.60
Some good people came out of there.

4844
04:22:02.60 --> 04:22:04.88
Not an amazing place.

4845
04:22:04.88 --> 04:22:05.88
It's a tough place.

4846
04:22:05.88 --> 04:22:07.88
People are the training there.

4847
04:22:07.88 --> 04:22:14.04
There's a lot of, it's rigorous at many places, but Harvard's reputation of, they really

4848
04:22:14.04 --> 04:22:16.92
like the old school academic grind.

4849
04:22:16.92 --> 04:22:20.72
They do modern science, but they really like to add friction.

4850
04:22:20.72 --> 04:22:22.04
Do you go out there, ever?

4851
04:22:22.04 --> 04:22:26.04
Yeah, we got a lot of friends at Harvard Medical School and the undergrad campus and I've

4852
04:22:26.04 --> 04:22:27.40
good relationship to all of them.

4853
04:22:27.40 --> 04:22:28.88
New York, it's neuroscience.

4854
04:22:28.88 --> 04:22:30.76
We call it the New York neuroscience mafia.

4855
04:22:30.76 --> 04:22:32.000
They all have tickets to the opera.

4856
04:22:32.000 --> 04:22:34.12
They all are very cultured and they do neuroscience.

4857
04:22:34.12 --> 04:22:37.04
Boston, they just live academics.

4858
04:22:37.04 --> 04:22:38.56
The town of Boston is amazing.

4859
04:22:38.56 --> 04:22:43.24
Students everywhere, everywhere in Boston, someone is pursuing something.

4860
04:22:43.24 --> 04:22:46.76
The punk rock bands in Boston work harder than anywhere else.

4861
04:22:46.76 --> 04:22:49.04
It's a, they like friction.

4862
04:22:49.04 --> 04:22:51.60
They're built on friction.

4863
04:22:51.60 --> 04:22:52.60
Boston, yeah.

4864
04:22:52.60 --> 04:22:57.88
Bay Area and Stanford, especially, it's about, because of the technology sector, it's

4865
04:22:57.88 --> 04:22:59.12
about the future.

4866
04:22:59.12 --> 04:23:03.40
We care about the lineage of the past, of course, and our no-bells and all that stuff, but

4867
04:23:03.40 --> 04:23:04.72
it's really about what's next.

4868
04:23:04.72 --> 04:23:06.36
The students want to start companies.

4869
04:23:06.36 --> 04:23:08.60
They want to change the entire world.

4870
04:23:08.60 --> 04:23:12.96
Other places too, but Stanford, there's this idea of the future is where it's at.

4871
04:23:12.96 --> 04:23:17.24
The past, you know, a nondegraduate one said to me, you know, I said, oh yeah, this guy

4872
04:23:17.24 --> 04:23:21.24
downstairs for me discovered the structure of RNA and his dad discovered basically RNA.

4873
04:23:21.24 --> 04:23:25.12
And he says, no-bell prize and like does he have an app?

4874
04:23:25.12 --> 04:23:30.48
And it's like, you know, I mean, that work is transformative in many ways, but it's just

4875
04:23:30.48 --> 04:23:32.32
well, how is it impacting the real world?

4876
04:23:32.32 --> 04:23:34.32
That's one reason I like really like being at Stanford.

4877
04:23:34.32 --> 04:23:36.96
It's about real world impact now.

4878
04:23:36.96 --> 04:23:38.72
But they're Harvard's great.

4879
04:23:38.72 --> 04:23:45.68
So basically you want to Chuck's Iser's Lab at Harvard Medical School showed that about

4880
04:23:45.68 --> 04:23:50.80
an hour before your natural bedtime, you're going to be very alert for about an hour.

4881
04:23:50.80 --> 04:23:55.20
There are evolutionary theories about why this would be that you're going to tamp down

4882
04:23:55.20 --> 04:23:57.72
all your village resources.

4883
04:23:57.72 --> 04:23:59.000
You're going to make sure you're safe.

4884
04:23:59.000 --> 04:24:00.000
That's security.

4885
04:24:00.000 --> 04:24:01.000
That's security.

4886
04:24:01.000 --> 04:24:02.000
That's security.

4887
04:24:02.000 --> 04:24:03.000
That's security.

4888
04:24:03.000 --> 04:24:04.000
That's security.

4889
04:24:04.000 --> 04:24:05.000
That's security.

4890
04:24:05.000 --> 04:24:06.000
That's security.

4891
04:24:06.000 --> 04:24:07.000
That's security.

4892
04:24:07.000 --> 04:24:08.000
That's not that.

4893
04:24:08.000 --> 04:24:09.000
Yeah, right?

4894
04:24:09.000 --> 04:24:10.000
You get ready for bed at night.

4895
04:24:10.000 --> 04:24:13.44
So go make sure that the external perimeter is secured.

4896
04:24:13.44 --> 04:24:15.08
Make sure that locks are locked.

4897
04:24:15.08 --> 04:24:16.44
Make sure the alarm systems are on.

4898
04:24:16.44 --> 04:24:21.000
Make sure the dog is rabbit and ready to eat people.

4899
04:24:21.000 --> 04:24:23.000
Make sure your Maggie seems to have loaded.

4900
04:24:23.000 --> 04:24:24.40
And you're going to go.

4901
04:24:24.40 --> 04:24:25.40
Booby traps are set.

4902
04:24:25.40 --> 04:24:32.64
Yeah, we are vulnerable and sleep as the vampire shift of ops knows all too well.

4903
04:24:32.64 --> 04:24:33.64
Right?

4904
04:24:33.64 --> 04:24:35.96
And it hit them while they're sleeping.

4905
04:24:35.96 --> 04:24:40.48
So you want to respect that and not worry about it.

4906
04:24:40.48 --> 04:24:42.56
A lot of people freak out why am I wide awake.

4907
04:24:42.56 --> 04:24:43.96
It will pass.

4908
04:24:43.96 --> 04:24:47.68
And I wish more people knew about this because it's everyone experiences this.

4909
04:24:47.68 --> 04:24:56.52
And then the other thing is light inhibits melatonin and melatonin is the molecule of sleepiness.

4910
04:24:56.52 --> 04:24:59.56
So viewing bright light will cross your melatonin.

4911
04:24:59.56 --> 04:25:01.88
That's why you want to dim the lights in the evening.

4912
04:25:01.88 --> 04:25:04.44
And if you wake up in the middle of the night and you need to go use the bathroom,

4913
04:25:04.44 --> 04:25:05.68
that's perfectly normal.

4914
04:25:05.68 --> 04:25:07.92
But don't flip on lights that are super bright.

4915
04:25:07.92 --> 04:25:09.24
Use a night light.

4916
04:25:09.24 --> 04:25:10.92
Don't use bright overhead lights.

4917
04:25:10.92 --> 04:25:12.44
Don't go into a super bright environment.

4918
04:25:12.44 --> 04:25:14.56
You will suppress your melatonin.

4919
04:25:14.56 --> 04:25:19.28
Now a lot of people go to bed around 11 or 12 and wake up around 2 or 3 and can't fall

4920
04:25:19.28 --> 04:25:20.76
back asleep.

4921
04:25:20.76 --> 04:25:24.96
And one more prominent theory in the sleep science community now is that those people should

4922
04:25:24.96 --> 04:25:30.92
have gone to bed at 8.30 or 9.00 PM and that their melatonin is running out basically.

4923
04:25:30.92 --> 04:25:33.44
So play with your bedtime.

4924
04:25:33.44 --> 04:25:37.76
I, for instance, have learned, we're talking about this before we started that a going

4925
04:25:37.76 --> 04:25:40.04
to bed for me at 10 PM.

4926
04:25:40.04 --> 04:25:40.88
I'm up at 4.

4927
04:25:40.88 --> 04:25:42.28
Feeling great.

4928
04:25:42.28 --> 04:25:47.68
If I go to bed at 11 PM or midnight, I can sleep till 7 or 8 and never feel quite right

4929
04:25:47.68 --> 04:25:51.56
and part of that because I'm waking up 2 or 3 times in the middle of the night.

4930
04:25:51.56 --> 04:25:55.56
So you have to figure out where your optimal to sleep time is and that will change across

4931
04:25:55.56 --> 04:25:56.80
the lifespan.

4932
04:25:56.80 --> 04:26:01.32
Young kids sometimes want to stay up later and sleep in later and need more sleep.

4933
04:26:01.32 --> 04:26:05.12
And as we get older, supposedly we need less sleep when we come early risers.

4934
04:26:05.12 --> 04:26:10.16
People obsess a little too much about this morning person, late person thing.

4935
04:26:10.16 --> 04:26:13.52
You got to figure out when your bed is too bed time is.

4936
04:26:13.52 --> 04:26:16.96
If you wake up in the middle of the night and you want to go back to sleep and you cannot,

4937
04:26:16.96 --> 04:26:20.20
I recommend listening to that non-sleep deep rest script.

4938
04:26:20.20 --> 04:26:25.40
Do at least keep you from scrolling through social media or thinking about problems.

4939
04:26:25.40 --> 04:26:29.72
You're better off doing non-sleep deep rest than being wide awake when you want to be

4940
04:26:29.72 --> 04:26:30.72
asleep.

4941
04:26:30.72 --> 04:26:33.88
And you're better off being asleep when you want to be asleep obviously.

4942
04:26:33.88 --> 04:26:40.72
So one way you can get better at sleeping is to use an app like Revery, our EVE, ERI.

4943
04:26:40.72 --> 04:26:42.68
This is based on research at Stanford.

4944
04:26:42.68 --> 04:26:44.24
There's a sleep function in there.

4945
04:26:44.24 --> 04:26:45.64
They will allow you to try it for free.

4946
04:26:45.64 --> 04:26:50.04
There is a nominal cost after that and it's hypnosis for sleep.

4947
04:26:50.04 --> 04:26:51.76
And it's not someone hypnotizing you.

4948
04:26:51.76 --> 04:26:55.64
It teaches you to relax yourself into a state where the new drift off into sleep.

4949
04:26:55.64 --> 04:26:59.36
And it's the clinical data and the scientific papers on this are very strong.

4950
04:26:59.36 --> 04:27:04.000
So is it, if I put on the app right now, what's it going to do?

4951
04:27:04.000 --> 04:27:05.28
I'm ready to go to sleep, what's it doing?

4952
04:27:05.28 --> 04:27:06.60
Does it tell me you think about this?

4953
04:27:06.60 --> 04:27:07.60
Yeah.

4954
04:27:07.60 --> 04:27:08.60
Is it ASMR?

4955
04:27:08.60 --> 04:27:09.60
What's it going to do?

4956
04:27:09.60 --> 04:27:10.60
It's ASMR.

4957
04:27:10.60 --> 04:27:11.60
Like the scratch.

4958
04:27:11.60 --> 04:27:12.60
Yeah, I agree.

4959
04:27:12.60 --> 04:27:16.88
I have this weird obsession with ASMR.

4960
04:27:16.88 --> 04:27:23.36
So there's a state of mind we call hypnosis that involves being very alert but focused

4961
04:27:23.36 --> 04:27:24.60
on internal state.

4962
04:27:24.60 --> 04:27:29.92
And normally it's hard to be very alert with your eyes closed and some people can access

4963
04:27:29.92 --> 04:27:31.84
this state better than others.

4964
04:27:31.84 --> 04:27:37.92
And in this state you are very suggestible and some people can be more readily hypnotized

4965
04:27:37.92 --> 04:27:38.92
than others.

4966
04:27:38.92 --> 04:27:42.92
There's a colleague of mine at Stanford David Spiegel and his father of MDs, his dad's

4967
04:27:42.92 --> 04:27:48.04
dead now, but they developed this field of hypnosis for psychiatry and for reprogramming

4968
04:27:48.04 --> 04:27:51.92
the mind and pain management, trauma, but also sleep, et cetera.

4969
04:27:51.92 --> 04:27:55.04
There's a simple test that we can do and anyone can do.

4970
04:27:55.04 --> 04:27:57.64
If you can look up, you can do this with Rogan didn't you?

4971
04:27:57.64 --> 04:28:02.96
Yeah, if you can maintain upward gaze and close your eyes, you are highly hypnotizable.

4972
04:28:02.96 --> 04:28:06.44
If you have a hard time maintaining upward gaze with your eyelids closed, you are less

4973
04:28:06.44 --> 04:28:07.68
hip and sizeable.

4974
04:28:07.68 --> 04:28:08.84
It's a wonderful scale.

4975
04:28:08.84 --> 04:28:13.08
Now keep in mind if this sounds wacky, how do they evaluate concussion based on the

4976
04:28:13.08 --> 04:28:16.64
size of the pupils relative to one another by shining light in one or the other eye.

4977
04:28:16.64 --> 04:28:22.64
So the eyes as two pieces of brain are the neurologists in this case, this psychiatrist,

4978
04:28:22.64 --> 04:28:26.000
primary tools to assess the brain without putting you into a brain scanner.

4979
04:28:26.000 --> 04:28:29.000
So it sounds wacky because it's like look up and then close your eyes.

4980
04:28:29.000 --> 04:28:30.000
We can do it with you.

4981
04:28:30.000 --> 04:28:35.84
If you look up and then keeping upward gaze slowly close your eyes.

4982
04:28:35.84 --> 04:28:38.56
Yep, looks like you can do it.

4983
04:28:38.56 --> 04:28:40.24
Yep, see how you sell the whites of his eyes?

4984
04:28:40.24 --> 04:28:41.24
That's what he said.

4985
04:28:41.24 --> 04:28:43.16
It means he's highly hypnotized.

4986
04:28:43.16 --> 04:28:44.16
Now why?

4987
04:28:44.16 --> 04:28:45.16
I'm going to make sense to me.

4988
04:28:45.16 --> 04:28:49.24
You can try revery and that will help you fall back asleep that sort of thing.

4989
04:28:49.24 --> 04:28:54.36
If you wake up in the middle then the worst thing you could do would be to look at any bright

4990
04:28:54.36 --> 04:28:55.36
light or screen light.

4991
04:28:55.36 --> 04:28:58.92
That would be a terrible idea because you're going to squash your melatonin and you're

4992
04:28:58.92 --> 04:29:01.32
going to start bringing in new sensory stimuli.

4993
04:29:01.32 --> 04:29:03.08
I mean, just think about how unusual that is.

4994
04:29:03.08 --> 04:29:06.000
Normally, you wouldn't bring in new sensory information in the middle of the night.

4995
04:29:06.000 --> 04:29:11.84
Now you're accessing information from Nova Scotia, Africa and Texas all at once and

4996
04:29:11.84 --> 04:29:15.12
you're watching the Lex Friedman body.

4997
04:29:15.12 --> 04:29:21.28
So those are the things around sleep that are really useful.

4998
04:29:21.28 --> 04:29:25.72
Then of course there are some supplements that if you're doing all the other things correctly

4999
04:29:25.72 --> 04:29:29.76
and you're still not sleeping well, the supplements that a lot of people benefit from are

5000
04:29:29.76 --> 04:29:35.88
magnesium 3 and 8, THR, EO and ATE or magnesium biskycinate.

5001
04:29:35.88 --> 04:29:40.92
Those forms of magnesium help speed the transition into sleep in the depth of sleep.

5002
04:29:40.92 --> 04:29:45.08
They are interchangeable with one another, biskycinate or 3 and 8 seem to be equally effective.

5003
04:29:45.08 --> 04:29:50.64
Some people also benefit from taking something called Apagene and API, GENI and it's a derivative

5004
04:29:50.64 --> 04:29:52.16
of chemo mile.

5005
04:29:52.16 --> 04:29:56.56
50 milligrams of Apagene will help you a lot of people turn off their thinking.

5006
04:29:56.56 --> 04:29:57.56
It's non-addictive.

5007
04:29:57.56 --> 04:29:59.16
It has high safety margins.

5008
04:29:59.16 --> 04:30:02.96
Obviously, talk to your doctor if that's important to you.

5009
04:30:02.96 --> 04:30:03.96
These things are readily available.

5010
04:30:03.96 --> 04:30:07.12
I don't have a relationship to Apagene and company Swanson makes it.

5011
04:30:07.12 --> 04:30:09.32
I have no relationship to Swanson.

5012
04:30:09.32 --> 04:30:15.04
Apagene 3 and 8 cost various tremendously where you look, I've seen it very expensive and

5013
04:30:15.04 --> 04:30:16.76
I've seen it less expensive.

5014
04:30:16.76 --> 04:30:19.48
I can't tell a difference between the different sources.

5015
04:30:19.48 --> 04:30:23.68
My wish is that the expensive companies will bring the price down, but I've noticed a ratcheting

5016
04:30:23.68 --> 04:30:24.68
up.

5017
04:30:24.68 --> 04:30:29.40
Some people will take, oh, and it's 144 milligrams of magnesium for whatever reason they

5018
04:30:29.40 --> 04:30:31.48
always charted out as 144.

5019
04:30:31.48 --> 04:30:35.48
About 5% of people will get some gastric distress from Mag 3 and 8.

5020
04:30:35.48 --> 04:30:40.12
It is distinct from magnesium malay toward magnesium citrate.

5021
04:30:40.12 --> 04:30:42.08
Magnesium citrate is a terrific laxative.

5022
04:30:42.08 --> 04:30:45.64
Magnesium malay seems to be better for muscle soreness and on and on.

5023
04:30:45.64 --> 04:30:49.32
There are these magnesium jockeys out there that get really nuanced about this, but Mag 3

5024
04:30:49.32 --> 04:30:51.32
and 8 are business class and it will help.

5025
04:30:51.32 --> 04:30:59.44
Then there's the Indian THEA and I and I and which many people take also before sleep

5026
04:30:59.44 --> 04:31:04.68
100 to 200 milligrams or so, it will give you more vivid dreams than you would otherwise.

5027
04:31:04.68 --> 04:31:09.92
So if you're a sleepwalker, you have night terrors, don't take it, but you can take that.

5028
04:31:09.92 --> 04:31:16.56
The Indian is now showing up in energy drinks and in coffee because it's a slight pushes

5029
04:31:16.56 --> 04:31:19.64
back on the systems that cause stress it reduces the jitters.

5030
04:31:19.64 --> 04:31:22.40
You can drink a lot more coffee if you're also taking the Indian, but everything I just

5031
04:31:22.40 --> 04:31:25.28
described would be taken 30 to 60 minutes before bed.

5032
04:31:25.28 --> 04:31:28.48
Then if you want to bring out the really heavy guns, which I haven't talked about before

5033
04:31:28.48 --> 04:31:33.76
in a podcast, but there's some interesting data and I've been looking at and researching

5034
04:31:33.76 --> 04:31:38.92
in osutall 900 milligrams of inosutall, wow, that's a sedative.

5035
04:31:38.92 --> 04:31:43.64
I mean, if there ever was any a sedative, it also is what's to do with a nosutall.

5036
04:31:43.64 --> 04:31:46.92
Inosutall is hitting these GABA urgent transmitters systems in the rug?

5037
04:31:46.92 --> 04:31:54.76
No, it's a supplement that it's in the vitamin pathway that will reduce anxiety.

5038
04:31:54.76 --> 04:31:59.12
900 milligrams of myotinosutall is the form that you want to seek out if you're going

5039
04:31:59.12 --> 04:32:00.12
to try this.

5040
04:32:00.12 --> 04:32:04.68
I did it for a while. I slept very, very well. I replaced the other stack with inosutall.

5041
04:32:04.68 --> 04:32:06.76
Again, no relationship to anosutall company.

5042
04:32:06.76 --> 04:32:08.76
The problem was I felt so mellow in the morning.

5043
04:32:08.76 --> 04:32:11.16
I didn't like it for me.

5044
04:32:11.16 --> 04:32:16.28
And why are podcasts for talk or if he doesn't do well with mag 3 and 8 disrupts

5045
04:32:16.28 --> 04:32:17.28
systems?

5046
04:32:17.28 --> 04:32:19.56
So he took inosutall and he called me in the next day. He's like, what is that stuff?

5047
04:32:19.56 --> 04:32:21.12
I slept 10 hours.

5048
04:32:21.12 --> 04:32:26.28
So different sensitivities, but inosutall seems to work well for people that are on a low

5049
04:32:26.28 --> 04:32:29.52
carbohydrate diet and have a hard time getting into sleep.

5050
04:32:29.52 --> 04:32:33.92
So I think we can expect the anosutall market is going to start to pick up some momentum

5051
04:32:33.92 --> 04:32:36.52
soon because it really does work quite well.

5052
04:32:36.52 --> 04:32:43.96
But better than ambient or prescription drugs, always go behaviors first, then supplements

5053
04:32:43.96 --> 04:32:46.64
if you need them and then the prescription stuff.

5054
04:32:46.64 --> 04:32:49.28
If that's your thing and you have a doctor that's going to help you with that.

5055
04:32:49.28 --> 04:32:53.52
But my goal has always been to rely on as few prescriptions of anything as possible by doing

5056
04:32:53.52 --> 04:32:57.28
the right behaviors avoiding them wrong behaviors and diet and supplements.

5057
04:32:57.28 --> 04:33:00.72
When you are a kid, you're going to that therapist and they maybe thought you were a little

5058
04:33:00.72 --> 04:33:01.72
jacked up.

5059
04:33:01.72 --> 04:33:03.72
Psychologically, did they put you on anything back then?

5060
04:33:03.72 --> 04:33:06.28
You open them so glad they did not.

5061
04:33:06.28 --> 04:33:09.84
Do you think the tendency now is that they put people on stuff a lot quicker?

5062
04:33:09.84 --> 04:33:11.08
That's the lead is right?

5063
04:33:11.08 --> 04:33:12.08
Absolutely.

5064
04:33:12.08 --> 04:33:14.88
And there are cases where this is vitally important.

5065
04:33:14.88 --> 04:33:21.60
But I am so grateful that I went through all that before the massive SSRI phase.

5066
04:33:21.60 --> 04:33:24.92
Before I don't think I had ADHD.

5067
04:33:24.92 --> 04:33:28.56
If anything I have a bit more of an OCD as you can probably tell, I get into a pretty narrow

5068
04:33:28.56 --> 04:33:32.84
tranche and I will just keep going until people say stop.

5069
04:33:32.84 --> 04:33:36.000
But I always have been that way.

5070
04:33:36.000 --> 04:33:39.40
But when I was a little kid, I a little bit of a grunting tick.

5071
04:33:39.40 --> 04:33:43.68
And my family physician was smart enough to know, just wait, it will pass.

5072
04:33:43.68 --> 04:33:47.08
Those four brain circuits of suppression are starting to develop.

5073
04:33:47.08 --> 04:33:49.68
Nowadays they put a kid on Tourette's medication.

5074
04:33:49.68 --> 04:33:53.68
So I am very wary of, I mean, you are blitzing these neurochemical systems.

5075
04:33:53.68 --> 04:33:56.08
And again, there are cases where people really need it.

5076
04:33:56.08 --> 04:34:00.92
Suicide or depression, please get on an antidepressant and get talk therapy.

5077
04:34:00.92 --> 04:34:04.20
Severe ADHD, please talk to a psychiatrist and a psychologist.

5078
04:34:04.20 --> 04:34:05.72
Get the diet right, too.

5079
04:34:05.72 --> 04:34:11.48
But I would just, my wish for humanity is that we, someone told me, I am cutting myself

5080
04:34:11.48 --> 04:34:12.48
off on purpose.

5081
04:34:12.48 --> 04:34:19.12
A psychiatrist colleague at Stanford told me that more than 75% of the psychoactive medication

5082
04:34:19.12 --> 04:34:23.48
that is consumed in the world is consumed in the United States.

5083
04:34:23.48 --> 04:34:26.72
It's us and we have no one to blame for this except ourselves.

5084
04:34:26.72 --> 04:34:34.44
And it's not like we have like the extremely rough environment that we're in America.

5085
04:34:34.44 --> 04:34:35.68
We created it in here.

5086
04:34:35.68 --> 04:34:36.68
Yeah.

5087
04:34:36.68 --> 04:34:42.88
What was up with the gun school suicide?

5088
04:34:42.88 --> 04:34:47.24
Because I did read a little bit about that when I was doing a little research on you.

5089
04:34:47.24 --> 04:34:49.64
And I just happened to happen to click into that.

5090
04:34:49.64 --> 04:34:50.92
What was going on with that?

5091
04:34:50.92 --> 04:34:54.36
What was it? 2017, they had four suicides.

5092
04:34:54.36 --> 04:34:56.000
They have a really high suicide rate.

5093
04:34:56.000 --> 04:34:57.96
What's going on with that?

5094
04:34:57.96 --> 04:34:58.96
Unclear.

5095
04:34:58.96 --> 04:35:03.16
But when I went to gun, it was academically rigorous.

5096
04:35:03.16 --> 04:35:05.68
Our football team was terrible, probably still as terrible.

5097
04:35:05.68 --> 04:35:07.24
But there were some good sports there.

5098
04:35:07.24 --> 04:35:09.96
So it wasn't a lack of physical activity.

5099
04:35:09.96 --> 04:35:14.24
Music and orchestra stuff is pretty big there.

5100
04:35:14.24 --> 04:35:20.04
So we know that now the kids are under significant pressure for academic performance.

5101
04:35:20.04 --> 04:35:23.36
There are train tracks not far from there.

5102
04:35:23.36 --> 04:35:27.28
And a good number of the suicides were by train.

5103
04:35:27.28 --> 04:35:30.96
It became a bit of a spreading phenomenon.

5104
04:35:30.96 --> 04:35:32.24
A little social contagion.

5105
04:35:32.24 --> 04:35:35.48
A little social contagion.

5106
04:35:35.48 --> 04:35:43.36
There is the idea that people were pushing their kids too hard in terms of academic performance,

5107
04:35:43.36 --> 04:35:44.60
who knows?

5108
04:35:44.60 --> 04:35:46.28
We can only speculate.

5109
04:35:46.28 --> 04:35:54.80
There was the idea that if you create an environment that's such high pressure and demand,

5110
04:35:54.80 --> 04:35:58.48
I think they've now forbidden the kids from meeting before school to do study sessions,

5111
04:35:58.48 --> 04:36:02.24
they were meeting at 6 am and studying.

5112
04:36:02.24 --> 04:36:05.92
And I don't think we can point our finger at any one thing or one collection of things.

5113
04:36:05.92 --> 04:36:11.24
But what a terrible situation.

5114
04:36:11.24 --> 04:36:16.92
I think it's hopefully resolved itself over time.

5115
04:36:16.92 --> 04:36:23.96
Someone from gun actually, someone related to gun, a parent, actually contacted me at one point

5116
04:36:23.96 --> 04:36:29.92
because they saw in their Wikipedia that I attended there and asked what my thoughts were on this.

5117
04:36:29.92 --> 04:36:34.04
And I said, listen, I'm not a psychiatrist or psychologist, but I went to that school.

5118
04:36:34.04 --> 04:36:37.64
I certainly had my challenges at that time.

5119
04:36:37.64 --> 04:36:39.40
Give them tools.

5120
04:36:39.40 --> 04:36:45.60
Please, tools matter, talking, the tele-friend or if you suspect absolutely call people,

5121
04:36:45.60 --> 04:36:50.32
but give people tools to understand when their mind is drifting off course.

5122
04:36:50.32 --> 04:36:55.000
And I think most of the tools that we've talked about today, certainly the behavioral ones,

5123
04:36:55.000 --> 04:36:58.88
they absolutely pertain to adults and the kids.

5124
04:36:58.88 --> 04:37:05.04
I think if our young people can learn how to self-regulate in both directions, ramp up and ramp down

5125
04:37:05.04 --> 04:37:07.96
as needed, overcome limbic friction, recognize limbic friction.

5126
04:37:07.96 --> 04:37:10.48
Understand the dopamine reward system.

5127
04:37:10.48 --> 04:37:15.80
I do hope I have this fantasy that it will help them know when they're on track and when

5128
04:37:15.80 --> 04:37:18.12
they're drifting off course.

5129
04:37:18.12 --> 04:37:24.32
One thing that I think is very cool about your story is, look, I've got four kids that

5130
04:37:24.32 --> 04:37:27.52
two of them in college now.

5131
04:37:27.52 --> 04:37:33.20
That pressure of this academic success to be in, it can be psycho.

5132
04:37:33.20 --> 04:37:34.40
And I think it's cool.

5133
04:37:34.40 --> 04:37:38.80
You're an example of someone that barely passed high school, took a little while to figure

5134
04:37:38.80 --> 04:37:41.44
out what you wanted to do was able to get on a path.

5135
04:37:41.44 --> 04:37:46.72
So maybe to all the kids out there, if you're under some hyper academic pressure right

5136
04:37:46.72 --> 04:37:51.12
now, man, you can get there.

5137
04:37:51.12 --> 04:37:52.92
You can get there.

5138
04:37:52.92 --> 04:37:56.84
This guy right here barely made it out of high school and now he's a tenured professor

5139
04:37:56.84 --> 04:37:57.84
at Stanford.

5140
04:37:57.84 --> 04:38:01.88
That's pretty awesome that you were able to do that.

5141
04:38:01.88 --> 04:38:07.60
And some of these kids, they don't get into whatever college they wanted to get into and

5142
04:38:07.60 --> 04:38:09.40
they think it's the end of the world.

5143
04:38:09.40 --> 04:38:13.36
And look, when you're young, of course, you break up with your girlfriend at the end of

5144
04:38:13.36 --> 04:38:14.36
the world.

5145
04:38:14.36 --> 04:38:16.84
You lose a football game at the end of the world.

5146
04:38:16.84 --> 04:38:17.84
There's all these things.

5147
04:38:17.84 --> 04:38:21.48
When your world is small, there's a lot of things that look like the end of the world.

5148
04:38:21.48 --> 04:38:25.96
But I think you're a great example of the fact that, look, you've got time to figure out

5149
04:38:25.96 --> 04:38:26.96
this stuff.

5150
04:38:26.96 --> 04:38:27.96
I'm the same way.

5151
04:38:27.96 --> 04:38:32.32
I was a rebellious young kid, didn't did shitty in high school.

5152
04:38:32.32 --> 04:38:33.32
Wasn't a great athlete.

5153
04:38:33.32 --> 04:38:38.44
OK, Joe, in the Navy, start going down the path and start to figure things out and the

5154
04:38:38.44 --> 04:38:40.40
same thing as you work hard.

5155
04:38:40.40 --> 04:38:44.56
So if you're a kid out there and you're feeling the pressures that the whole world's

5156
04:38:44.56 --> 04:38:50.24
going to fall apart because you missed some random hurdle about getting into college or

5157
04:38:50.24 --> 04:38:53.84
whatever you got on your SATs, which by the way, I don't take SATs anymore.

5158
04:38:53.84 --> 04:38:59.08
I don't think that's like, I heard they don't have physical education anymore either.

5159
04:38:59.08 --> 04:39:01.44
They do have physical education.

5160
04:39:01.44 --> 04:39:03.72
They still do have physical education.

5161
04:39:03.72 --> 04:39:06.32
I would say it's probably not as rigorous as it should be.

5162
04:39:06.32 --> 04:39:10.72
I'm sure you've seen those videos of what that's some school in the 50s or 60s that

5163
04:39:10.72 --> 04:39:13.80
they put this regimented physical education in.

5164
04:39:13.80 --> 04:39:17.12
And these kids, if you've seen those videos on talking about Echo Charles, yeah, the one

5165
04:39:17.12 --> 04:39:18.76
they're doing the drop to the push-ups.

5166
04:39:18.76 --> 04:39:21.52
Yeah, they're doing push-ups, but like, it's a troupe.

5167
04:39:21.52 --> 04:39:24.64
And these kids all look like freaking commandos.

5168
04:39:24.64 --> 04:39:26.36
It's pretty awesome.

5169
04:39:26.36 --> 04:39:28.24
And that's how it should be.

5170
04:39:28.24 --> 04:39:34.72
But yeah, I think you're a great example of, hey, you don't have to have a perfect path

5171
04:39:34.72 --> 04:39:39.16
to being very successful and doing what you truly want to do.

5172
04:39:39.16 --> 04:39:41.64
And there's another thing that kids get messed up on.

5173
04:39:41.64 --> 04:39:44.72
They think they should know what they want to do, what they want to do with their lives

5174
04:39:44.72 --> 04:39:46.92
when they're 14 years old.

5175
04:39:46.92 --> 04:39:48.20
And what do you want to be in your group?

5176
04:39:48.20 --> 04:39:49.20
I don't know.

5177
04:39:49.20 --> 04:39:50.20
And they feel bad because of that.

5178
04:39:50.20 --> 04:39:51.92
It's actually perfectly fine.

5179
04:39:51.92 --> 04:39:53.80
Take a little time to figure it out.

5180
04:39:53.80 --> 04:39:55.68
Now, I will say this.

5181
04:39:55.68 --> 04:39:56.92
And you already said this as well.

5182
04:39:56.92 --> 04:39:58.08
Go to school.

5183
04:39:58.08 --> 04:39:59.56
Try and get good grades.

5184
04:39:59.56 --> 04:40:01.12
Don't do freaking drugs.

5185
04:40:01.12 --> 04:40:02.12
Don't get in trouble.

5186
04:40:02.12 --> 04:40:06.000
Because then your options will be broader when you do get older.

5187
04:40:06.000 --> 04:40:08.64
But none of these things are the end of the world.

5188
04:40:08.64 --> 04:40:10.12
But actually, I'm talking about kids.

5189
04:40:10.12 --> 04:40:11.36
I'm not just talking about kids.

5190
04:40:11.36 --> 04:40:14.28
You can be 38 years old and figure out, oh, you know what?

5191
04:40:14.28 --> 04:40:16.000
I'm going to get my shit together right now.

5192
04:40:16.000 --> 04:40:17.40
I'm going to start moving in the right direction.

5193
04:40:17.40 --> 04:40:20.60
I mean, you talked about a bunch of skateboarders and I knew a bunch of hard

5194
04:40:20.60 --> 04:40:26.92
cork kids that didn't square themselves away until they were 37 years old.

5195
04:40:26.92 --> 04:40:30.48
And so we all have options out there.

5196
04:40:30.48 --> 04:40:33.04
And you're not going to nail it.

5197
04:40:33.04 --> 04:40:35.44
Man, no one nails a perfect game.

5198
04:40:35.44 --> 04:40:36.44
It doesn't happen.

5199
04:40:36.44 --> 04:40:37.44
No, it doesn't.

5200
04:40:37.44 --> 04:40:41.76
And, you know, if you can start early, great, but develop great work habits, but learn

5201
04:40:41.76 --> 04:40:43.76
how to toggle between work and rest.

5202
04:40:43.76 --> 04:40:47.64
And always say, find non-destructive ways to renew yourself.

5203
04:40:47.64 --> 04:40:53.56
So many of the forms of renewal, not just when kids are in college or in high school.

5204
04:40:53.56 --> 04:40:55.28
But also, I look at the corporate world.

5205
04:40:55.28 --> 04:40:58.08
And this is an issue that I actually had with academia for a long time.

5206
04:40:58.08 --> 04:41:03.36
It was like, how are we going to rest after a hard week of work and graduate school?

5207
04:41:03.36 --> 04:41:04.60
They're going to be a hour.

5208
04:41:04.60 --> 04:41:06.48
And you got people just like tying one on.

5209
04:41:06.48 --> 04:41:07.48
OK, sure.

5210
04:41:07.48 --> 04:41:08.48
I have nothing against people.

5211
04:41:08.48 --> 04:41:11.52
I have in a couple cocktails if that's their thing or beer or whatever.

5212
04:41:11.52 --> 04:41:16.000
But people just finding absolutely destructive ways to learn to rest.

5213
04:41:16.000 --> 04:41:18.24
They don't learn anything in that case.

5214
04:41:18.24 --> 04:41:21.96
So have non-destructive ways to recover yourself.

5215
04:41:21.96 --> 04:41:25.60
That could be a long jog or a hike on the weekends or go swimming or go watch a movie

5216
04:41:25.60 --> 04:41:27.36
or do something creative, draw.

5217
04:41:27.36 --> 04:41:31.20
I mean, spend time with people, whatever it is.

5218
04:41:31.20 --> 04:41:35.36
And I realize I'm coming across as kind of, you know, as it sounds a little corny.

5219
04:41:35.36 --> 04:41:40.64
But at the same time, you will go further and faster than everybody.

5220
04:41:40.64 --> 04:41:41.64
Yeah.

5221
04:41:41.64 --> 04:41:44.24
And what's important about what you just said, and this is some time back to something

5222
04:41:44.24 --> 04:41:49.28
you talked about earlier with these dopamine systems that we have.

5223
04:41:49.28 --> 04:41:50.28
It's a cycle.

5224
04:41:50.28 --> 04:41:52.40
And you can get yourself moving on the right cycle.

5225
04:41:52.40 --> 04:41:53.88
But that first step is hard.

5226
04:41:53.88 --> 04:41:54.88
Right?

5227
04:41:54.88 --> 04:41:57.04
That first, you're going to get a reward when you go for a run.

5228
04:41:57.04 --> 04:42:00.04
You're going to get a reward when you get done with squats.

5229
04:42:00.04 --> 04:42:02.000
You're going to get reward when you get done with you, too.

5230
04:42:02.000 --> 04:42:03.28
You're going to get a reward.

5231
04:42:03.28 --> 04:42:08.32
But that getting there, you have to impose that first part yourself.

5232
04:42:08.32 --> 04:42:10.32
You have to make it happen.

5233
04:42:10.32 --> 04:42:13.76
And that's, there's going to be, you know, your limbic system is going to be giving you

5234
04:42:13.76 --> 04:42:15.92
friction about how comfortable you are right now.

5235
04:42:15.92 --> 04:42:17.76
And maybe just another donut will be just as good.

5236
04:42:17.76 --> 04:42:19.72
And that's kind of an reward right now.

5237
04:42:19.72 --> 04:42:21.32
Don't listen to it.

5238
04:42:21.32 --> 04:42:23.72
Take action, go out and step into it.

5239
04:42:23.72 --> 04:42:27.32
And you're going to start yourself onto a cycle that is way more positive.

5240
04:42:27.32 --> 04:42:31.92
And it's going to have much better results in the long run than listening to your limbic

5241
04:42:31.92 --> 04:42:35.28
system, which is telling you to eat another donut, have another beer, get some immediate

5242
04:42:35.28 --> 04:42:38.08
dopamine from something that takes no effort whatsoever.

5243
04:42:38.08 --> 04:42:41.68
Yeah, we're sit back and just scroll to your death.

5244
04:42:41.68 --> 04:42:43.68
Oh, yeah.

5245
04:42:43.68 --> 04:42:47.56
Listen, probably a good place to wrap it up.

5246
04:42:47.56 --> 04:42:51.08
We're approaching five hours.

5247
04:42:51.08 --> 04:42:55.60
Anybody that's listening to this that wants to go deep look, there's probably some people

5248
04:42:55.60 --> 04:42:57.64
to think, I know he kind of went deep on some subjects.

5249
04:42:57.64 --> 04:43:03.08
No, this was like Andrew Huberman, the shallow zone, right?

5250
04:43:03.08 --> 04:43:06.48
You know, yeah, this is the Cliff Notes version.

5251
04:43:06.48 --> 04:43:09.08
It's podcast, you can find work, it's everywhere, right?

5252
04:43:09.08 --> 04:43:10.08
Any other podcast?

5253
04:43:10.08 --> 04:43:11.08
Spotify.

5254
04:43:11.08 --> 04:43:12.08
Yep.

5255
04:43:12.08 --> 04:43:14.48
It's Huberman Lab, Huberman Lab podcast.

5256
04:43:14.48 --> 04:43:19.68
He's going to take everything that he mentioned today for four minutes or six minutes.

5257
04:43:19.68 --> 04:43:23.48
He's going to talk about for two and a half to three hours with a bunch of scientific

5258
04:43:23.48 --> 04:43:25.08
data to back it up.

5259
04:43:25.08 --> 04:43:28.64
Awesome to listen to.

5260
04:43:28.64 --> 04:43:33.32
And you can figure out they're very, very efficiently titled, hey, this is the subject

5261
04:43:33.32 --> 04:43:34.80
of this podcast.

5262
04:43:34.80 --> 04:43:36.68
Here's what you can learn.

5263
04:43:36.68 --> 04:43:38.92
And I touched on some of these things today.

5264
04:43:38.92 --> 04:43:40.80
Hab, it's stress, you know, hormones.

5265
04:43:40.80 --> 04:43:42.92
You've got all these different topics.

5266
04:43:42.92 --> 04:43:45.52
It's just awesome information.

5267
04:43:45.52 --> 04:43:47.28
Also they can find you at Huberman.

5268
04:43:47.28 --> 04:43:50.08
You say Huberman or Huberman Lab.

5269
04:43:50.08 --> 04:43:51.08
Huberman Lab.com.

5270
04:43:51.08 --> 04:43:54.24
This is kind of a good access point for everything.

5271
04:43:54.24 --> 04:43:55.84
You're on YouTube and Facebook.

5272
04:43:55.84 --> 04:43:58.52
Both of those are Andrew Huberman.

5273
04:43:58.52 --> 04:44:02.80
And then you're on Twitter, on Instagram, sucking people into the algorithm, bringing

5274
04:44:02.80 --> 04:44:09.28
out the anger in the hatred, collecting data on who's frustrated and the anger system.

5275
04:44:09.28 --> 04:44:10.52
Both those are at.

5276
04:44:10.52 --> 04:44:14.80
It's a Twitter and Instagram at Huberman Lab.

5277
04:44:14.80 --> 04:44:17.08
Echo, you got any other questions?

5278
04:44:17.08 --> 04:44:18.08
Of course.

5279
04:44:18.08 --> 04:44:19.08
What do you got?

5280
04:44:19.08 --> 04:44:20.08
I'm going to keep it.

5281
04:44:20.08 --> 04:44:24.80
So the variable reward, what was the random intermittent reward?

5282
04:44:24.80 --> 04:44:25.80
Yeah.

5283
04:44:25.80 --> 04:44:30.44
So it doesn't that kind of illustrate the value of playing hard to get in like dating

5284
04:44:30.44 --> 04:44:31.44
and stuff.

5285
04:44:31.44 --> 04:44:32.44
It does.

5286
04:44:32.44 --> 04:44:35.24
I'm wondering if you're going to ask about this.

5287
04:44:35.24 --> 04:44:39.44
Some people understand this intuitively and they catch string people.

5288
04:44:39.44 --> 04:44:44.40
They don't reward everything.

5289
04:44:44.40 --> 04:44:48.68
It's amazing the tactics that people will come up with in order to get the text responsive.

5290
04:44:48.68 --> 04:44:51.36
They're not getting it.

5291
04:44:51.36 --> 04:44:52.36
Here's what we know.

5292
04:44:52.36 --> 04:44:55.40
A picture is worth a thousand words.

5293
04:44:55.40 --> 04:44:56.40
Use your imagination.

5294
04:44:56.40 --> 04:44:59.40
Some people realize, ah, you know, when I text them, they don't respond.

5295
04:44:59.40 --> 04:45:04.48
But when I send a photo of a particular kind, their responses, instant genius.

5296
04:45:04.48 --> 04:45:05.88
People learn.

5297
04:45:05.88 --> 04:45:08.08
People's response schedules very quickly.

5298
04:45:08.08 --> 04:45:12.16
This carcans backed a childhood and we could do a whole episode on this as a child.

5299
04:45:12.16 --> 04:45:18.04
One of your primary, the brain's a prediction machine or it's trying to make predictions.

5300
04:45:18.04 --> 04:45:19.44
That's what it wants to do.

5301
04:45:19.44 --> 04:45:25.40
And young children learn to engage in certain behaviors to predict and control the care

5302
04:45:25.40 --> 04:45:26.40
taking of their parents.

5303
04:45:26.40 --> 04:45:30.40
This is important.

5304
04:45:30.40 --> 04:45:32.40
It's not manipulative.

5305
04:45:32.40 --> 04:45:33.40
It's vital.

5306
04:45:33.40 --> 04:45:34.40
And adults do it too.

5307
04:45:34.40 --> 04:45:36.96
And they do it in the same machinery that's designed for infant caregiver attachment is repurposed

5308
04:45:36.96 --> 04:45:39.40
in adulthood.

5309
04:45:39.40 --> 04:45:46.44
So when we want something from somebody, then we tend to pay careful attention to their

5310
04:45:46.44 --> 04:45:49.52
movements and when they respond and their non-responses.

5311
04:45:49.52 --> 04:45:53.64
And random entertainment and reward is what a lot of people use to keep people along

5312
04:45:53.64 --> 04:45:55.64
for their right.

5313
04:45:55.64 --> 04:46:02.84
Now, there's a positive version of this where to keep the intensity high in the positive

5314
04:46:02.84 --> 04:46:04.08
sense in relationship.

5315
04:46:04.08 --> 04:46:05.56
Yeah, it's good to miss someone.

5316
04:46:05.56 --> 04:46:06.72
It's good to take some breaks.

5317
04:46:06.72 --> 04:46:11.52
You don't want to overdo the dopamine system because it will deplete itself.

5318
04:46:11.52 --> 04:46:15.24
Time together, time apart is useful.

5319
04:46:15.24 --> 04:46:20.64
The cozy parts of love and the more intense romantic, lusty parts of love are both vital

5320
04:46:20.64 --> 04:46:23.20
to the arc of a relationship.

5321
04:46:23.20 --> 04:46:27.64
But one, you could imagine how time apart could reset some of the dopamine.

5322
04:46:27.64 --> 04:46:31.72
People seem more attractive and exciting when you've been apart from them for a while.

5323
04:46:31.72 --> 04:46:36.08
And a lot of people kind of suffocate their relationship with serotonin.

5324
04:46:36.08 --> 04:46:37.08
So to speak.

5325
04:46:37.08 --> 04:46:42.04
Too much time together will give you all the warm, cozy stuff, but will it's antagonistic

5326
04:46:42.04 --> 04:46:44.68
as we say to the dopamine system.

5327
04:46:44.68 --> 04:46:49.40
But people manipulate using these systems.

5328
04:46:49.40 --> 04:46:56.52
That's unfortunate, but I'm not an expert in how to counsel them on that.

5329
04:46:56.52 --> 04:47:01.68
So it is, you might not be an expert on how to counsel them on it.

5330
04:47:01.68 --> 04:47:06.08
But if people are aware of it, they can do a better job combating, becoming a victim

5331
04:47:06.08 --> 04:47:07.32
to those scenarios.

5332
04:47:07.32 --> 04:47:11.28
And I always say, you should be very careful how much you attach your dopamine to something

5333
04:47:11.28 --> 04:47:14.04
that is not under your complete control.

5334
04:47:14.04 --> 04:47:19.16
If you give your entire dopamine system over to somebody else's responses or availability

5335
04:47:19.16 --> 04:47:23.72
you're setting yourself up for a pretty rough life, even if it's a great relationship.

5336
04:47:23.72 --> 04:47:28.000
Because either whether or not by decision or by death or by circumstance, if that relationship

5337
04:47:28.000 --> 04:47:29.32
were to go, what are you going to do?

5338
04:47:29.32 --> 04:47:35.96
So I think people tend to get overly focused on how much dopamine someone else can provide.

5339
04:47:35.96 --> 04:47:36.96
I think it's great.

5340
04:47:36.96 --> 04:47:43.08
I have a statement about addiction, which I think matches the scientific mechanism very

5341
04:47:43.08 --> 04:47:47.24
closely, which is that addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you

5342
04:47:47.24 --> 04:47:48.84
pleasure.

5343
04:47:48.84 --> 04:47:53.52
Whereas a good life involves a progressive expansion of the number of things that bring

5344
04:47:53.52 --> 04:47:54.76
you pleasure.

5345
04:47:54.76 --> 04:47:59.28
So try and continue to derive pleasure from, for instance, time with friends.

5346
04:47:59.28 --> 04:48:03.08
We all know the guy who's got the new girlfriend and then disappears and then comes back

5347
04:48:03.08 --> 04:48:05.76
six months later, he's like, yeah, you know.

5348
04:48:05.76 --> 04:48:10.20
So I told you so, you know, it's okay to miss one another.

5349
04:48:10.20 --> 04:48:11.56
It's okay to miss one another.

5350
04:48:11.56 --> 04:48:16.000
It's okay to not text all the time when you're with friends, spend time with friends.

5351
04:48:16.000 --> 04:48:18.72
Be available for emergencies, but spend time with friends.

5352
04:48:18.72 --> 04:48:23.12
These cuts both way, women with women with men with men and assuming that standard relationship

5353
04:48:23.12 --> 04:48:24.12
model.

5354
04:48:24.12 --> 04:48:25.72
The, you know, when you're with your guy friends, be with them.

5355
04:48:25.72 --> 04:48:26.72
Right?

5356
04:48:26.72 --> 04:48:28.40
Ladies, when you're with your girlfriends, be with them.

5357
04:48:28.40 --> 04:48:33.52
And you are missing one another is great because you're keeping that dopamine system

5358
04:48:33.52 --> 04:48:34.52
ready.

5359
04:48:34.52 --> 04:48:39.04
So the, I mean, on a kind of a more positive note, you can kind of use it as, like, in the

5360
04:48:39.04 --> 04:48:41.48
courting phase, we'll say, sure.

5361
04:48:41.48 --> 04:48:45.96
Like, don't just throw yourself at somebody because you kind of jam their system up a little

5362
04:48:45.96 --> 04:48:46.96
bit, right?

5363
04:48:46.96 --> 04:48:52.52
Yeah, I mean, you know, at some point you don't want to game things too much, right?

5364
04:48:52.52 --> 04:48:53.52
It's a, this gets right.

5365
04:48:53.52 --> 04:48:58.80
This gets into some deeper issues about power and dynamics in the relationships, right?

5366
04:48:58.80 --> 04:49:03.60
You know, it is giving tons of gifts to someone assigned that they're in charge or that

5367
04:49:03.60 --> 04:49:04.60
you're in charge.

5368
04:49:04.60 --> 04:49:08.32
Why don't know, depends on your relative finances, right?

5369
04:49:08.32 --> 04:49:11.52
In one case, you could be the person saying, I have resources and I can take care of

5370
04:49:11.52 --> 04:49:12.52
you forever.

5371
04:49:12.52 --> 04:49:14.24
In a sense, you're in the power position.

5372
04:49:14.24 --> 04:49:17.52
In another case, you're just showering them with gifts in a desperate attempt to get

5373
04:49:17.52 --> 04:49:18.68
them to like you.

5374
04:49:18.68 --> 04:49:23.16
So there's a lot of context of this that makes it tricky, but I would say that giving

5375
04:49:23.16 --> 04:49:28.84
to get is a very dangerous thing, pure giving without the expectation of a reward and

5376
04:49:28.84 --> 04:49:35.84
exchange for that is great because then both people get to experience that as a positive

5377
04:49:35.84 --> 04:49:40.72
thing and, you know, giving to get it puts you in a very vulnerable place.

5378
04:49:40.72 --> 04:49:45.36
So essentially with great power comes great responsibility.

5379
04:49:45.36 --> 04:49:46.36
Absolutely.

5380
04:49:46.36 --> 04:49:48.36
That's how guys get friends on, no?

5381
04:49:48.36 --> 04:49:49.56
That's how you get friends on.

5382
04:49:49.56 --> 04:49:53.88
You can be like, what do you call like a catch, but you give too much to quick.

5383
04:49:53.88 --> 04:49:54.88
You get friends on.

5384
04:49:54.88 --> 04:49:59.64
Yeah, I mean, I confess I have a few close female friends that have over the years.

5385
04:49:59.64 --> 04:50:03.92
Most of my friends are men and have a relationship with a woman.

5386
04:50:03.92 --> 04:50:06.84
So that's got, that's just what how it's been organized.

5387
04:50:06.84 --> 04:50:11.76
I don't, I haven't developed many close friendships with women.

5388
04:50:11.76 --> 04:50:16.44
So friend zone is a bit of a foreign concept to me, but I hear it exists.

5389
04:50:16.44 --> 04:50:21.72
Yeah, it's like, yeah, basically the girl doesn't have sexual attraction to the guy, even

5390
04:50:21.72 --> 04:50:24.16
though the guy is like the perfect guy.

5391
04:50:24.16 --> 04:50:28.04
But it's usually because the guy positions himself below the girl, like he worships

5392
04:50:28.04 --> 04:50:32.28
her too quick or something like this and the girl's like, oh, he's not like a challenge,

5393
04:50:32.28 --> 04:50:33.28
you know, dating sounds.

5394
04:50:33.28 --> 04:50:42.52
I'm a big, I think it was Tim Ferriss, our mutual friend Tim Ferriss that a long time

5395
04:50:42.52 --> 04:50:48.72
ago said, you know, the quality of your life is largely reflective of the number of really

5396
04:50:48.72 --> 04:50:51.44
difficult conversations that you're willing to have.

5397
04:50:51.44 --> 04:50:54.52
And I love that because I'm not very good at difficult conversations.

5398
04:50:54.52 --> 04:50:55.52
Who is?

5399
04:50:55.52 --> 04:50:56.36
That's why they're called difficult.

5400
04:50:56.36 --> 04:51:01.20
But I think the person concerned about being friend zone should sit down with the person

5401
04:51:01.20 --> 04:51:03.24
and say, listen, here's what I really want.

5402
04:51:03.24 --> 04:51:09.64
What is the probability that's going to happen in the next week?

5403
04:51:09.64 --> 04:51:14.92
And if it's a, well, the 25% okay, well, hit the rip record.

5404
04:51:14.92 --> 04:51:19.36
And if it's a 75% or I've been waiting for you to say this, like, let's go.

5405
04:51:19.36 --> 04:51:23.80
You know, I mean, it seems like direct communication is lacking in the, I don't know,

5406
04:51:23.80 --> 04:51:24.80
I can't remember.

5407
04:51:24.80 --> 04:51:26.84
We're about to go, we're about to open up a whole other scenario here.

5408
04:51:26.84 --> 04:51:28.16
Yeah, I'm not sure I'm the best person.

5409
04:51:28.16 --> 04:51:29.16
I'm not sure.

5410
04:51:29.16 --> 04:51:30.16
We're not.

5411
04:51:30.16 --> 04:51:33.84
We don't. If you've got the, let's say you got a girl that you're trying to talk to.

5412
04:51:33.84 --> 04:51:38.32
And you think you might be in the friends zone up, sort of assaulting her with the

5413
04:51:38.32 --> 04:51:42.32
hate where to where my hat that I'm going to say that might not be the best.

5414
04:51:42.32 --> 04:51:47.60
What I would probably do is assume we're just friends and behave that way.

5415
04:51:47.60 --> 04:51:50.40
Don't assume that you're going to, don't assume that there's chance you just assume

5416
04:51:50.40 --> 04:51:53.000
hey, you know what, she probably doesn't really like me that much.

5417
04:51:53.000 --> 04:51:56.12
That's you, something you make back off.

5418
04:51:56.12 --> 04:52:02.68
If, if she ends up actually feeling that way, then she's going to come and let you know

5419
04:52:02.68 --> 04:52:03.68
that.

5420
04:52:03.68 --> 04:52:06.84
So your behavior should be, oh, she just wants to be friends.

5421
04:52:06.84 --> 04:52:07.84
Cool.

5422
04:52:07.84 --> 04:52:13.12
Don't box her into a corner with the, with the edge of the human, freaking direct assault.

5423
04:52:13.12 --> 04:52:14.32
Hey, where are we at?

5424
04:52:14.32 --> 04:52:15.32
Girl.

5425
04:52:15.32 --> 04:52:18.000
Well, I'm not even sure it has to be a verbal communication.

5426
04:52:18.000 --> 04:52:22.60
I think you could just be a, you know, is this relationship over romantic sexual relationship

5427
04:52:22.60 --> 04:52:24.24
or is this a friendship?

5428
04:52:24.24 --> 04:52:28.72
And you don't, there are numerous ways to have that conversation, but obviously it should

5429
04:52:28.72 --> 04:52:31.72
be consensual age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate.

5430
04:52:31.72 --> 04:52:41.28
But, but listen, what you're describing to me is for interrogatory because I'm not,

5431
04:52:41.28 --> 04:52:48.68
I just not of the, the ilk that is in the habit of, of having a lot of, you know, friendships

5432
04:52:48.68 --> 04:52:50.08
as I for male friendships.

5433
04:52:50.08 --> 04:52:54.12
I wouldn't, that's just as unhappy.

5434
04:52:54.12 --> 04:52:56.12
This is a, was that, I think we just got a humble brag.

5435
04:52:56.12 --> 04:52:59.48
I think we got a, he's like, listen, I don't know what you're talking about, this friend's

5436
04:52:59.48 --> 04:53:00.80
own thing, never been there.

5437
04:53:00.80 --> 04:53:01.80
Not a thing.

5438
04:53:01.80 --> 04:53:02.80
I like it, bro.

5439
04:53:02.80 --> 04:53:03.80
I'm saying that.

5440
04:53:03.80 --> 04:53:06.68
I'm just saying it's hard for a video of that.

5441
04:53:06.68 --> 04:53:10.24
And that anyone who'd find themselves in this position, I mean, also be a scientist, the

5442
04:53:10.24 --> 04:53:11.72
data or the data, right?

5443
04:53:11.72 --> 04:53:15.16
I do believe that somebody wants to do something they're basically going to do it.

5444
04:53:15.16 --> 04:53:16.44
And if they don't, they're not going to.

5445
04:53:16.44 --> 04:53:17.44
Yeah, yeah.

5446
04:53:17.44 --> 04:53:18.44
Jack.

5447
04:53:18.44 --> 04:53:23.96
The going back to a little bit more serious, no, what you said about, you know, you

5448
04:53:23.96 --> 04:53:28.60
shouldn't give to get, this is something I breathe leaders on all the time.

5449
04:53:28.60 --> 04:53:32.60
If the reason you're taking care of your team is so that you can get something out of

5450
04:53:32.60 --> 04:53:34.20
them, they're going to see that.

5451
04:53:34.20 --> 04:53:35.60
And it's not going to work out well.

5452
04:53:35.60 --> 04:53:40.000
So very similar, very similar, fought pattern there.

5453
04:53:40.000 --> 04:53:46.28
Andrew, are you going to, you know, closing thoughts before we shut it down?

5454
04:53:46.28 --> 04:53:49.84
Just really want to say thank you for having me here today.

5455
04:53:49.84 --> 04:53:51.92
It's a truly an honor and pleasure.

5456
04:53:51.92 --> 04:53:53.16
I don't say that formally.

5457
04:53:53.16 --> 04:53:59.04
And as a listener of your podcast, this has been a thrill for me.

5458
04:53:59.04 --> 04:54:00.64
I've learned a lot from both of you guys.

5459
04:54:00.64 --> 04:54:05.92
And while I'm not going to roll you to you, because I don't know how, maybe someday.

5460
04:54:05.92 --> 04:54:07.76
And yeah, thanks so much.

5461
04:54:07.76 --> 04:54:09.20
Well, thanks for coming.

5462
04:54:09.20 --> 04:54:13.28
And back at you, you know, as a listener of your podcast, it's awesome to be able

5463
04:54:13.28 --> 04:54:15.80
to sit down and drill down on some of these things.

5464
04:54:15.80 --> 04:54:19.48
And you know, really a really important thing.

5465
04:54:19.48 --> 04:54:26.16
I would say there's a theme that I've taken away from your podcast, but then that I absolutely

5466
04:54:26.16 --> 04:54:27.92
reinforced today.

5467
04:54:27.92 --> 04:54:29.16
I talked about it a little bit.

5468
04:54:29.16 --> 04:54:33.84
The fact that the things that you're talking about really allow us to bring awareness

5469
04:54:33.84 --> 04:54:41.08
to what's happening in our bodies, in our minds physiologically.

5470
04:54:41.08 --> 04:54:48.68
And therefore, we actually have more influence than we think over what our fault patterns

5471
04:54:48.68 --> 04:54:57.40
are and the way we behave, which ultimately allows us as people to take more ownership

5472
04:54:57.40 --> 04:55:00.64
over the way we feel the way we behave.

5473
04:55:00.64 --> 04:55:02.64
And those are really important things.

5474
04:55:02.64 --> 04:55:11.12
And I think just understanding the nature of our own physiology, better is a huge step

5475
04:55:11.12 --> 04:55:14.20
forward in people living better at lives.

5476
04:55:14.20 --> 04:55:16.88
So thank you for coming down and joining us.

5477
04:55:16.88 --> 04:55:21.72
And thank you for taking that information and passing it on to people for free.

5478
04:55:21.72 --> 04:55:23.76
You know, you do this stuff for free.

5479
04:55:23.76 --> 04:55:31.16
Your podcast is free and you've invested obviously a ton of time to try and learn these

5480
04:55:31.16 --> 04:55:32.16
things.

5481
04:55:32.16 --> 04:55:37.76
And the fact that you give it back to people for free is just a testament to the kind

5482
04:55:37.76 --> 04:55:39.04
of person you are.

5483
04:55:39.04 --> 04:55:40.64
And I appreciate it.

5484
04:55:40.64 --> 04:55:42.48
And I hope you keep getting after it, man.

5485
04:55:42.48 --> 04:55:43.48
Thanks for coming down.

5486
04:55:43.48 --> 04:55:46.36
Thank you.

5487
04:55:46.36 --> 04:55:50.16
And with that Andrew Huberin has left the building.

5488
04:55:50.16 --> 04:55:51.16
He's rolled out.

5489
04:55:51.16 --> 04:55:53.16
Echo, did you gather any good information?

5490
04:55:53.16 --> 04:55:54.16
Yes.

5491
04:55:54.16 --> 04:55:55.16
Lots of going on.

5492
04:55:55.16 --> 04:55:58.44
You can see there's probably going to be follow on podcasts.

5493
04:55:58.44 --> 04:55:59.44
Yes.

5494
04:55:59.44 --> 04:56:05.04
But you could have taken like one of those questions that you kind of like said and like

5495
04:56:05.04 --> 04:56:07.88
do four hours just on that.

5496
04:56:07.88 --> 04:56:09.96
Not to mention the stuff that you probably wouldn't even understand.

5497
04:56:09.96 --> 04:56:10.96
That's like another what?

5498
04:56:10.96 --> 04:56:12.44
12, 16 hours per week.

5499
04:56:12.44 --> 04:56:13.44
It's crazy.

5500
04:56:13.44 --> 04:56:16.52
Check.

5501
04:56:16.52 --> 04:56:17.52
No, great guy.

5502
04:56:17.52 --> 04:56:18.52
Great information.

5503
04:56:18.52 --> 04:56:22.76
Definitely cool to talk to and you know even just when he was leaving you know we'll

5504
04:56:22.76 --> 04:56:24.52
definitely get some stuff done.

5505
04:56:24.52 --> 04:56:26.76
Do some more stuff in the future.

5506
04:56:26.76 --> 04:56:29.28
Yeah, man.

5507
04:56:29.28 --> 04:56:34.36
I really, I really do the point that I was making kind of throughout the podcast and that

5508
04:56:34.36 --> 04:56:40.64
I kind of closed out with like look just being aware of these things makes you better off.

5509
04:56:40.64 --> 04:56:44.36
Then you realize that you can influence the way you feel the way you think, the way you

5510
04:56:44.36 --> 04:56:45.36
sleep, the way you be.

5511
04:56:45.36 --> 04:56:46.36
You have way more influence.

5512
04:56:46.36 --> 04:56:47.88
You don't have to wake up in the morning.

5513
04:56:47.88 --> 04:56:49.40
Go man, sleep good night.

5514
04:56:49.40 --> 04:56:50.40
No, why?

5515
04:56:50.40 --> 04:56:51.60
You don't need to do that.

5516
04:56:51.60 --> 04:56:52.60
You don't need to go.

5517
04:56:52.60 --> 04:56:53.60
I don't really feel like we're going out.

5518
04:56:53.60 --> 04:56:54.60
You don't need to do that.

5519
04:56:54.60 --> 04:56:57.24
I know why I don't feel like working right out right now because I expanded a bunch of

5520
04:56:57.24 --> 04:56:58.76
dope for me on something that's earliest morning.

5521
04:56:58.76 --> 04:56:59.76
But you know what?

5522
04:56:59.76 --> 04:57:00.76
It doesn't matter.

5523
04:57:00.76 --> 04:57:01.76
It doesn't mean I'm a bad person.

5524
04:57:01.76 --> 04:57:03.32
It just means that you need to go and get it started.

5525
04:57:03.32 --> 04:57:05.16
Take ownership of what's happened.

5526
04:57:05.16 --> 04:57:08.72
So I thought that was well worth the price of admission.

5527
04:57:08.72 --> 04:57:12.96
Oh, yeah. If you're at the tail end of a four something hour podcast right now, I think

5528
04:57:12.96 --> 04:57:15.56
that right there was worth the price that you just paid.

5529
04:57:15.56 --> 04:57:17.32
Maybe you two exit.

5530
04:57:17.32 --> 04:57:18.96
Maybe you listen to it at two x speed right now.

5531
04:57:18.96 --> 04:57:19.96
I'm not going to go.

5532
04:57:19.96 --> 04:57:20.96
I'm not going to go.

5533
04:57:20.96 --> 04:57:21.96
It's possible.

5534
04:57:21.96 --> 04:57:22.96
What do you think?

5535
04:57:22.96 --> 04:57:25.36
Well, percentage of people go to x speed when they're listening.

5536
04:57:25.36 --> 04:57:27.36
Well, depends on what portion.

5537
04:57:27.36 --> 04:57:28.36
Yeah.

5538
04:57:28.36 --> 04:57:30.36
Sometimes, it's suspect.

5539
04:57:30.36 --> 04:57:32.44
Sometimes they do two x.

5540
04:57:32.44 --> 04:57:35.40
Sometimes they do one x.

5541
04:57:35.40 --> 04:57:36.76
With this one, I don't know man.

5542
04:57:36.76 --> 04:57:37.76
This is a kind of where Brad.

5543
04:57:37.76 --> 04:57:39.32
I want to listen to it to x.

5544
04:57:39.32 --> 04:57:40.32
You want to get it.

5545
04:57:40.32 --> 04:57:41.32
That's going to go.

5546
04:57:41.32 --> 04:57:42.32
Some of that stuff's going to go over your head.

5547
04:57:42.32 --> 04:57:43.84
I think you're going to want one x on this one.

5548
04:57:43.84 --> 04:57:44.84
Yes, for sure.

5549
04:57:44.84 --> 04:57:48.80
I'd say a lot of our podcasts actually are one x series.

5550
04:57:48.80 --> 04:57:49.80
Yeah.

5551
04:57:49.80 --> 04:57:50.80
It's true.

5552
04:57:50.80 --> 04:57:54.96
I was surprised though, as you probably could tell, that he wasn't as familiar with

5553
04:57:54.96 --> 04:57:58.000
the idea of the frenzo.

5554
04:57:58.000 --> 04:58:00.56
Because I think this is just my hypothesis.

5555
04:58:00.56 --> 04:58:01.56
Yeah.

5556
04:58:01.56 --> 04:58:03.52
My neurobiological hypothesis.

5557
04:58:03.52 --> 04:58:04.52
That the frenzo.

5558
04:58:04.52 --> 04:58:05.52
The frenzo.

5559
04:58:05.52 --> 04:58:06.52
The frenzo.

5560
04:58:06.52 --> 04:58:09.60
The frenzo is a direct result.

5561
04:58:09.60 --> 04:58:12.40
But hey, wait, was the frenzo on a thing when you were a kid?

5562
04:58:12.40 --> 04:58:13.40
Yeah.

5563
04:58:13.40 --> 04:58:14.40
Okay, see?

5564
04:58:14.40 --> 04:58:15.40
Was it called the expression?

5565
04:58:15.40 --> 04:58:16.60
No, okay, but it was a thing.

5566
04:58:16.60 --> 04:58:17.60
Oh, yeah.

5567
04:58:17.60 --> 04:58:18.60
That you were in.

5568
04:58:18.60 --> 04:58:21.80
I think you were just kind of saying it.

5569
04:58:21.80 --> 04:58:25.40
To be honest, I remember one instance where I was in the front.

5570
04:58:25.40 --> 04:58:26.40
Well, put it this way.

5571
04:58:26.40 --> 04:58:33.48
I had like one foot in the frenzo and one foot out of the frenzo.

5572
04:58:33.48 --> 04:58:38.36
I was surprised on how little influence I had over the scenario.

5573
04:58:38.36 --> 04:58:41.40
And then thinking back, I was in the frenzo.

5574
04:58:41.40 --> 04:58:46.88
So because I was this person, man, if I understood this variable reward scenario, better.

5575
04:58:46.88 --> 04:58:47.88
Better.

5576
04:58:47.88 --> 04:58:50.12
I would have had more influence over that.

5577
04:58:50.12 --> 04:58:51.12
But it's true.

5578
04:58:51.12 --> 04:58:55.96
I think it's a direct result of this, of not understanding the variable reward.

5579
04:58:55.96 --> 04:59:00.92
If you're just like, oh, yeah, freaking, I'm just going to do everything that I think

5580
04:59:00.92 --> 04:59:03.44
this girl wants me to do.

5581
04:59:03.44 --> 04:59:07.12
That in and of itself creates a lack of variable reward.

5582
04:59:07.12 --> 04:59:08.12
That's right.

5583
04:59:08.12 --> 04:59:09.12
Yeah.

5584
04:59:09.12 --> 04:59:10.12
We're considering this to be a problem.

5585
04:59:10.12 --> 04:59:15.04
So it's going to keep you around for that whatever the serotonin, what is your tone.

5586
04:59:15.04 --> 04:59:21.16
But there's no real, there's no real dopamine because of that phenomenon.

5587
04:59:21.16 --> 04:59:22.72
It was flooding it with serotonin.

5588
04:59:22.72 --> 04:59:23.72
It's too much, too much.

5589
04:59:23.72 --> 04:59:24.72
Not enough dopamine.

5590
04:59:24.72 --> 04:59:26.72
So stay out the frenzo.

5591
04:59:26.72 --> 04:59:27.72
Just tell the frenzo.

5592
04:59:27.72 --> 04:59:31.96
Especially someone might you that apparently spent a lot of time in the frenzo.

5593
04:59:31.96 --> 04:59:35.80
That was a long time ago.

5594
04:59:35.80 --> 04:59:39.24
Hey, take your listening.

5595
04:59:39.24 --> 04:59:42.04
We started it long, but that's the way it happened sometimes.

5596
04:59:42.04 --> 04:59:45.16
If you want to support the podcast and you want to support yourself, you want to get

5597
04:59:45.16 --> 04:59:48.52
some, you used out for the, you used down for the discipline go.

5598
04:59:48.52 --> 04:59:49.52
Yeah.

5599
04:59:49.52 --> 04:59:50.52
And down for the discipline go.

5600
04:59:50.52 --> 04:59:54.40
And if you notice, with no one really made a thing out of it, but he mentioned

5601
04:59:54.40 --> 04:59:55.40
the anine, right?

5602
04:59:55.40 --> 04:59:58.88
When he was like, and he said, oh, I like the anine, I like it.

5603
04:59:58.88 --> 05:00:01.68
Some people mix it with coffee so you don't get the jitters a lot.

5604
05:00:01.68 --> 05:00:04.76
So, I was about to say, wow, well, I don't want to interrupt.

5605
05:00:04.76 --> 05:00:05.76
Yeah.

5606
05:00:05.76 --> 05:00:08.12
Plus then it sounds like you're trying to hard sell something.

5607
05:00:08.12 --> 05:00:09.12
Yeah.

5608
05:00:09.12 --> 05:00:10.12
Well, actually we did.

5609
05:00:10.12 --> 05:00:11.12
I don't want to be that guy.

5610
05:00:11.12 --> 05:00:12.12
Exactly.

5611
05:00:12.12 --> 05:00:16.56
But yes, we have the ultimate formulation for energy.

5612
05:00:16.56 --> 05:00:18.72
For the ultimate formula.

5613
05:00:18.72 --> 05:00:20.20
We have to kind of have the ultimate formulation.

5614
05:00:20.20 --> 05:00:21.20
Yes, sir.

5615
05:00:21.20 --> 05:00:22.20
And think about it.

5616
05:00:22.20 --> 05:00:24.96
And he said, he straight up takes alpha GPC.

5617
05:00:24.96 --> 05:00:28.84
Takes it as a supplement except when he's drinking the go.

5618
05:00:28.84 --> 05:00:32.08
Because alpha GPC, he mentioned the the anine and all the benefits of whatever.

5619
05:00:32.08 --> 05:00:33.48
Hey, look, we kept it cool.

5620
05:00:33.48 --> 05:00:36.32
We're not going to make a big deal out of it, but it's awesome.

5621
05:00:36.32 --> 05:00:38.72
We kind of got you covered on all fronts.

5622
05:00:38.72 --> 05:00:42.76
So, that's awesome.

5623
05:00:42.76 --> 05:00:45.24
If you want to get some of that, go to jockelfuel.com.

5624
05:00:45.24 --> 05:00:47.08
You go to wallongget some of it.

5625
05:00:47.08 --> 05:00:50.04
You can go to vitamin shop and get whatever.

5626
05:00:50.04 --> 05:00:57.36
You can get milk, by the way, which is, which is, look, I love to tell you, hey, you

5627
05:00:57.36 --> 05:00:59.16
need additional protein and you do.

5628
05:00:59.16 --> 05:01:00.16
I get it.

5629
05:01:00.16 --> 05:01:04.60
But you also need something that tastes hell a good.

5630
05:01:04.60 --> 05:01:08.64
Get yourself some milk, get yourselves some joint warfare, some super krill.

5631
05:01:08.64 --> 05:01:12.000
I've been noticing you've been saying, how a good lately.

5632
05:01:12.000 --> 05:01:13.000
Really?

5633
05:01:13.000 --> 05:01:16.000
That's like the third time you said in the last three days, two days.

5634
05:01:16.000 --> 05:01:17.000
Really?

5635
05:01:17.000 --> 05:01:18.000
Yes, sir.

5636
05:01:18.000 --> 05:01:21.92
Is it kind of an older, like, an 80s expression, isn't it?

5637
05:01:21.92 --> 05:01:24.84
If I'm not mistaken, it's just more than California expression.

5638
05:01:24.84 --> 05:01:25.84
For sure.

5639
05:01:25.84 --> 05:01:27.40
Because in Maine, we say wicked good.

5640
05:01:27.40 --> 05:01:28.40
Yes.

5641
05:01:28.40 --> 05:01:30.48
Yeah, those are those, that know about Maine.

5642
05:01:30.48 --> 05:01:31.48
Yeah, we know that.

5643
05:01:31.48 --> 05:01:36.08
But I think that's a hell of good is like, like, when you first said it, I was like, wait,

5644
05:01:36.08 --> 05:01:37.48
what is the reason for that?

5645
05:01:37.48 --> 05:01:40.68
Oh, I don't know, but that's still remains a mystery.

5646
05:01:40.68 --> 05:01:41.92
Now the last year, correct.

5647
05:01:41.92 --> 05:01:42.92
Yep.

5648
05:01:42.92 --> 05:01:44.32
It is hell of a good vitamin shop.

5649
05:01:44.32 --> 05:01:46.32
Wall-watt, jockelfuel.com.

5650
05:01:46.32 --> 05:01:51.96
Get yourself some supplementation that's going to make you bigger, faster, stronger, smarter,

5651
05:01:51.96 --> 05:01:52.96
smarter.

5652
05:01:52.96 --> 05:01:53.96
Pull mine yards.

5653
05:01:53.96 --> 05:01:54.96
There you go.

5654
05:01:54.96 --> 05:01:56.64
It's a chemically two.

5655
05:01:56.64 --> 05:01:57.64
Yeah.

5656
05:01:57.64 --> 05:01:59.04
Because we didn't talk that much about the sugar.

5657
05:01:59.04 --> 05:02:00.44
Oh, we did talk about the crash.

5658
05:02:00.44 --> 05:02:01.44
Right?

5659
05:02:01.44 --> 05:02:02.44
You get all these crashes.

5660
05:02:02.44 --> 05:02:03.88
You start doing all this stuff to your brain chemistry.

5661
05:02:03.88 --> 05:02:04.88
Get these crashes.

5662
05:02:04.88 --> 05:02:05.88
Don't get them.

5663
05:02:05.88 --> 05:02:06.88
Get them up.

5664
05:02:06.88 --> 05:02:07.88
Don't get them.

5665
05:02:07.88 --> 05:02:08.88
You don't have to deal with that kind of stuff anymore.

5666
05:02:08.88 --> 05:02:09.88
No, darkofool.com.

5667
05:02:09.88 --> 05:02:11.88
Check out origin usa.com.

5668
05:02:11.88 --> 05:02:14.20
You're probably going to need a ghee, right?

5669
05:02:14.20 --> 05:02:16.16
Because we're training GJ2.

5670
05:02:16.16 --> 05:02:17.16
It look.

5671
05:02:17.16 --> 05:02:22.44
I would love to tell you where that ghee down to the market, out to the club.

5672
05:02:22.44 --> 05:02:23.44
You can't.

5673
05:02:23.44 --> 05:02:25.44
You know, you can't.

5674
05:02:25.44 --> 05:02:26.64
It's probably going to get you friends on.

5675
05:02:26.64 --> 05:02:28.64
Don't let that happen.

5676
05:02:28.64 --> 05:02:31.28
No, you might have a female.

5677
05:02:31.28 --> 05:02:33.000
Let's say you're a male.

5678
05:02:33.000 --> 05:02:35.48
You might have a female that's real into GJ2, which is super cool.

5679
05:02:35.48 --> 05:02:36.48
Maybe she's down.

5680
05:02:36.48 --> 05:02:37.88
You know, maybe she's wearing a ghee.

5681
05:02:37.88 --> 05:02:39.28
Maybe we're wearing ghee's out.

5682
05:02:39.28 --> 05:02:40.28
Maybe that's what we're doing.

5683
05:02:40.28 --> 05:02:41.28
Just do it sometimes.

5684
05:02:41.28 --> 05:02:42.28
How about that?

5685
05:02:42.28 --> 05:02:43.92
But that might not be the case.

5686
05:02:43.92 --> 05:02:44.92
You might need it.

5687
05:02:44.92 --> 05:02:45.92
You might need a pair of jeans.

5688
05:02:45.92 --> 05:02:46.92
Right?

5689
05:02:46.92 --> 05:02:47.92
We got your jeans too.

5690
05:02:47.92 --> 05:02:48.92
Made in America.

5691
05:02:48.92 --> 05:02:50.92
Made in the United States of America.

5692
05:02:50.92 --> 05:02:51.92
Yeah.

5693
05:02:51.92 --> 05:02:53.80
DIY.

5694
05:02:53.80 --> 05:02:55.20
Do it yourself.

5695
05:02:55.20 --> 05:02:56.20
That's so.

5696
05:02:56.20 --> 05:03:01.16
You know, only because Andrew kind of mentioned this DIY mentality that you get from

5697
05:03:01.16 --> 05:03:03.12
the punk rock, the hard core scene.

5698
05:03:03.12 --> 05:03:04.60
It's kind of like do it yourself.

5699
05:03:04.60 --> 05:03:05.60
Right?

5700
05:03:05.60 --> 05:03:07.64
By the way, that's why jockel publishing exists.

5701
05:03:07.64 --> 05:03:09.08
That's why we have jockel few.

5702
05:03:09.08 --> 05:03:10.08
Because we're making stuff.

5703
05:03:10.08 --> 05:03:11.08
We don't go.

5704
05:03:11.08 --> 05:03:12.08
Hey, you know, we'd really like to do this.

5705
05:03:12.08 --> 05:03:13.96
So we'll just, you know, like, hey, hey, hey.

5706
05:03:13.96 --> 05:03:14.96
No, we're doing it.

5707
05:03:14.96 --> 05:03:15.96
That's what we're doing.

5708
05:03:15.96 --> 05:03:18.68
I don't want to split hairs here.

5709
05:03:18.68 --> 05:03:23.12
But this might be small tangent, but I think it's important.

5710
05:03:23.12 --> 05:03:28.20
DIY has like a contextual element to it.

5711
05:03:28.20 --> 05:03:29.72
It's short for do it yourself.

5712
05:03:29.72 --> 05:03:30.72
Yeah.

5713
05:03:30.72 --> 05:03:31.72
But so put it this way.

5714
05:03:31.72 --> 05:03:33.08
DIY doesn't mean do it yourself.

5715
05:03:33.08 --> 05:03:39.08
And do it yourself is do what I why, but not all the, I, why means all the things

5716
05:03:39.08 --> 05:03:40.08
that do it yourself mean.

5717
05:03:40.08 --> 05:03:41.44
Okay, so we're doing what you do.

5718
05:03:41.44 --> 05:03:44.88
So DIY, if you say, if you're on my idea, if you're going to do it, then you

5719
05:03:44.88 --> 05:03:50.16
move on, this is a technicality that may or may not be important.

5720
05:03:50.16 --> 05:03:56.16
And DIY, when you say DIY, if I say, hey, if jockel, you say, hey, can you get me some

5721
05:03:56.16 --> 05:03:57.16
water?

5722
05:03:57.16 --> 05:03:58.16
And I say, do it yourself.

5723
05:03:58.16 --> 05:03:59.16
Okay, so let's do it.

5724
05:03:59.16 --> 05:04:00.84
That is one of the many do it yourself.

5725
05:04:00.84 --> 05:04:08.04
DIY means like usually it's done, not like as a favor, but like as a production,

5726
05:04:08.04 --> 05:04:10.92
kind of a thing.

5727
05:04:10.92 --> 05:04:13.52
And then you just did it yourself, like kind of makeshift.

5728
05:04:13.52 --> 05:04:17.64
Okay, it has a makeshift, like kind of quality kind of feel to it.

5729
05:04:17.64 --> 05:04:18.64
So you can say.

5730
05:04:18.64 --> 05:04:19.64
You good?

5731
05:04:19.64 --> 05:04:20.64
Yes, okay.

5732
05:04:20.64 --> 05:04:22.28
Let's go to jockelstore.com.

5733
05:04:22.28 --> 05:04:31.84
So jockelstore, which started as a do I DIY scenario, but it's not anymore.

5734
05:04:31.84 --> 05:04:36.88
It's a well, you know, the varying levels of met, oiled machine.

5735
05:04:36.88 --> 05:04:37.88
Yeah.

5736
05:04:37.88 --> 05:04:41.72
Right now, got some good stuff on there, got some discipline equals freedom, shirts and

5737
05:04:41.72 --> 05:04:45.08
hat, turdies, merch, if you will, but it's good quality stuff.

5738
05:04:45.08 --> 05:04:46.76
Not just some cheap stuff.

5739
05:04:46.76 --> 05:04:48.08
It's good quality.

5740
05:04:48.08 --> 05:04:51.96
Arguably the most wearable clothing.

5741
05:04:51.96 --> 05:04:54.16
That seems to be the consensus kind of around.

5742
05:04:54.16 --> 05:04:55.16
Yes.

5743
05:04:55.16 --> 05:04:58.88
Many people, when I say men, I mean, for real, like countless, not the kind of like three.

5744
05:04:58.88 --> 05:05:03.80
Like countless people have said, it's my free favorite shirt, not just because of the design

5745
05:05:03.80 --> 05:05:06.80
and the representing on the path, but because of how it fits.

5746
05:05:06.80 --> 05:05:09.48
What about when they get a shirt locker shirt?

5747
05:05:09.48 --> 05:05:10.48
Same.

5748
05:05:10.48 --> 05:05:11.48
It's a lot of the same.

5749
05:05:11.48 --> 05:05:15.72
And they think, man, there's only a few people that have this shirt.

5750
05:05:15.72 --> 05:05:20.72
Like Andrew was talking about, he was talking about the thunder, trucks shirt.

5751
05:05:20.72 --> 05:05:21.72
Oh, it's limited.

5752
05:05:21.72 --> 05:05:22.72
That's why he saved.

5753
05:05:22.72 --> 05:05:25.08
He still has it to this day.

5754
05:05:25.08 --> 05:05:26.08
He has it to this day.

5755
05:05:26.08 --> 05:05:27.64
You can just shirt a locker shirt.

5756
05:05:27.64 --> 05:05:30.04
You're kind of in that arena.

5757
05:05:30.04 --> 05:05:31.04
Exclusive and limited.

5758
05:05:31.04 --> 05:05:32.04
Yeah.

5759
05:05:32.04 --> 05:05:33.04
It's true.

5760
05:05:33.04 --> 05:05:35.80
So what that is, if you don't know, it's a subscription scenario.

5761
05:05:35.80 --> 05:05:37.24
You can make sure every month.

5762
05:05:37.24 --> 05:05:39.04
Here's the thing about that shirt that you've talked about.

5763
05:05:39.04 --> 05:05:40.04
What did it say?

5764
05:05:40.04 --> 05:05:41.04
Something about something something.

5765
05:05:41.04 --> 05:05:43.08
It's only sponsored by thunder trucks.

5766
05:05:43.08 --> 05:05:45.08
And I only got this t-shirt.

5767
05:05:45.08 --> 05:05:46.08
It's just lousy.

5768
05:05:46.08 --> 05:05:47.08
T-shirt.

5769
05:05:47.08 --> 05:05:51.24
Okay, so this is why I remember that because there are other shirt companies that do, you

5770
05:05:51.24 --> 05:05:56.84
know, like the kind of shirt companies that make fun shirts, like that are knock up, like a,

5771
05:05:56.84 --> 05:06:00.96
they almost borrow like the concept in the design from like Coca-Cola.

5772
05:06:00.96 --> 05:06:01.96
But it says, chope.

5773
05:06:01.96 --> 05:06:03.32
Instead of Coca-Cola, it says chope.

5774
05:06:03.32 --> 05:06:05.68
You know, like that idea.

5775
05:06:05.68 --> 05:06:10.16
Like there's a few that I saw that had that same thing.

5776
05:06:10.16 --> 05:06:13.28
I said, I'm something something something like something real impressive.

5777
05:06:13.28 --> 05:06:15.44
And then it said, but I only got this lousy t-shirt.

5778
05:06:15.44 --> 05:06:16.48
It was like, that's hard.

5779
05:06:16.48 --> 05:06:17.48
I remember it.

5780
05:06:17.48 --> 05:06:18.48
Yeah.

5781
05:06:18.48 --> 05:06:19.48
That was the thing.

5782
05:06:19.48 --> 05:06:23.12
You know, I ran the Boston Marathon and all I got was this one.

5783
05:06:23.12 --> 05:06:24.12
Yeah.

5784
05:06:24.12 --> 05:06:27.92
I went to Bulgaria and all I got was this lousy t-shirt.

5785
05:06:27.92 --> 05:06:28.92
Yeah.

5786
05:06:28.92 --> 05:06:29.92
So yeah.

5787
05:06:29.92 --> 05:06:31.32
But yeah, some shirts are exclusive.

5788
05:06:31.32 --> 05:06:32.32
Yeah.

5789
05:06:32.32 --> 05:06:33.32
That's just the nature of the things.

5790
05:06:33.32 --> 05:06:35.72
All those things that we just said are a little bit lame.

5791
05:06:35.72 --> 05:06:36.72
Right?

5792
05:06:36.72 --> 05:06:39.64
Unless it's from thunder trucks and it's limited.

5793
05:06:39.64 --> 05:06:42.92
And then all of a sudden it becomes kind of rad.

5794
05:06:42.92 --> 05:06:44.92
You are kind of hype.

05:06:44.92 --> 05:06:49.96

Because you can't let the man control everything.

5803
05:07:13.16 --> 05:07:15.16
You can't get power to the man.

5804
05:07:15.16 --> 05:07:16.16
You can't.

5805
05:07:16.16 --> 05:07:17.16
You don't want to.

5806
05:07:17.16 --> 05:07:19.96
You've got to create your own platform over on the side in case you have to escape

5807
05:07:19.96 --> 05:07:21.68

You're trying to get that dopamine hitter.

it.

So thanks, Andrew, for driving all the way down here to make this happen.

5890
05:10:31.36 --> 05:10:34.24
And I look forward to returning the favor in the future.

5891
05:10:34.24 --> 05:10:40.64
And of course, thanks to the service men and service women out there on the frontlines.

5892
05:10:40.64 --> 05:10:46.40
Make it possible for us to sit back here and get educated and learn and live our lives.

5893
05:10:46.40 --> 05:10:47.64
Thank you for what you do.

5894
05:10:47.64 --> 05:10:53.24
Also, thanks for the service of our police and law enforcement firefighters, paramedics,

5895
05:10:53.24 --> 05:10:57.84
EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, border patrol, secret service.

5896
05:10:57.84 --> 05:11:03.56
All the first responders out there, you all do what you do so that we can do what we do.

Look, there's a lot of ways to get better.

5901
05:11:15.16 --> 05:11:17.20
We learn today that you can become aware of.

5902
05:11:17.20 --> 05:11:19.20
You should have become more aware of things.

5903
05:11:19.20 --> 05:11:21.24
You should realize you have more influence.

5904
05:11:21.24 --> 05:11:25.48
You realize you have influence over the way you feel, the way you think.

5905
05:11:25.48 --> 05:11:27.40
You could take ownership of that.

5906
05:11:27.40 --> 05:11:30.40
Learn a lot about that today.

5907
05:11:30.40 --> 05:11:31.76
And you know what?

5908
05:11:31.76 --> 05:11:35.72
Knowledge and learning and understanding are great.

5909
05:11:35.72 --> 05:11:40.28
But you know what else they don't mean anything without action.

5910
05:11:40.28 --> 05:11:47.64
So yes, learn and educate and enlighten yourself, but also don't forget to go out there

5911
05:11:47.64 --> 05:11:52.76
every day and freaking get after it.

5912
05:11:52.76 --> 05:12:13.64
Until next time, Zekko and Joko out.
