I took felt borrowed and every check of my watch brought disbelief that we had lived a few more minutes longer you get a little you get a little briefing from the army captain we came from that direction and we were heading in that direction toward those buildings early last night the US army captain vehicle commander of the Bradley that transported us here said jestering with a knife in hand this was a joint US Iraqi security security force patrol so there were five Americans and two ISFs in there the vehicle commander was ejected when it happened so we already have him recovered he was a good man what a fucking shame he pointed down the road that led off into the indistinguishable unknown of the delicate mist be careful the security team walked in that area a couple hours ago and the insurgents tried to get them by blowing up another big ID down that way those guys got lucky and nobody got hurt so don't have any of your guys go down there and stay off the sides of the road we don't know what's in that area the ID creator was the biggest I had ever seen taking up the entire road and it was just as deep as it was wide the Bradley suffered such a catastrophic blow that it was in several pieces the heavy diesel engine was ejected it's turret now lying 40 yards away and upside down and there was a whole several feet wide in the center of the chassis the vehicle was held together only by half of the frame the EOD professional slowly let solely yet cautiously work their way towards the smoldering mechanical carcass deliberately picking up the unexploded rounds along the way the rounds were meticulously collected and set into a pile of short distance from the Bradley my SNR team ready the body bags as I began to wonder if we brought enough of them for all the pieces of these poor guys the vehicle was actually going this way and the ID went off and it ended up going that way it was pointed in the total opposite direction of the way it was traveling the turret was popped off of it and I that's that chapter is the strongest man of the youngest and he definitely was like I said it's worth reading so that people can understand how all that unfolded and and what you guys did what how it affected him how you guys took care of him and and obviously the the outcome is positive I guess there's no other way to say it because I know it's not a positive situation but the outcome is positive you know you use able to continue on go on more deployments continue to do his job going back to the book 17 weeks at past since our arrival here to teach you and over that course of time I had watched our mission here take a toll upon each and every one of us in the platoon our mission of processing angels had slowly bled the color out of our lives until the one day when we woke up to find the whole world gray there was nothing to look forward to but the slow grind of our work and the end of our date the end date of our deployment which still seemed so far away our day to day reality here was filled with an ever increasing level of gruesomeness with the opening of each bag just when you thought you'd seen it all there would be one more unimaginable horror that would take your breath away it was said that there was no tougher duty than this mission and that there was no greater honor than more charity affairs duty but there was nothing about this mission that would be motivating to any of us because no matter how you looked at it at the end of the day you are putting the broken pieces of yet another American hero into another black vinyl bag to be sent home to another family who had soon have their world shattered and with each set of remains that we sent home a little piece of ourselves went with them we know we'll find another way so we chose another way and then another way well you explained it to your guys there is no other choice brother canly and I are going to ride in this Bradley here we're just going to have to stack all the body bags and gear on top of us this here is the shit that night mirrors are made of and I would never ask you guys to do anything that I wouldn't do myself the team just looked at me with wide eyes standing there and looking perplexed for a second it was a cardinal rule to never stack the remains and always treat the fallen with the utmost respect but the reality of the situation demanded that we do this way there clearly wasn't any other choice in a matter we had to get them and us home canly and I climbed in come on let's start getting these guys in here and get this shit over with the angels were stacked on top of us from Florida ceiling and they're uncomfortable weight crushed my legs causing my feet to fall sleep little rips of form little rips had formed in the corners of the black vinyl body bags from the difficulty of maneuvering inside the first and now the second Bradley allowing some of the viscocities to escape we were ready to go and I couldn't wait to get out of here as you guys are driving back you described this we passed a couple of M1 Abrams tanks at an intersection they were blocking traffic for us the entire way back to combat outpost correct or was guarded by one of the most beautiful sites that I've ever seen a US Army platoon of heavy armor taking over this side of the city ensuring our way home holy ship we just might make it I looked over at Sergeant Kimley to tell him yet it's a um and don't look at me bro come on look at me for a point you walked down the valley but and situation how about the you know it's a catch-off that is a terrible I use it a lot not only can you get geese and rash cart which are factually according to echelacharls and many other people many many other people I think everybody is the best are the best you can also get other clothes there you can get t-shirts you can get a heavyweight sweatshirt that is legitimately heavyweight four Montana four Michigan four Maine do you need it in Southern California probably not you can also get jeans for your legs and you can get there's two different kinds of jeans heavyweight called the factere jeans and then there's a lightweight jeans which are called the Delta 68 jeans so if you you know you have jeans you need jeans you might as well get the best jeans jeans that are comfortable functional durable and they happen to look like that that's what you're going to put something on your legs put those on your legs yes agree also through our workouts fitness jujitsu as well we can use we can utilize supplementation got to be good supplementation hard work clean fuel clean I was talking about supplements and how much of a part of my life supplements are specifically every single day I take joint warfare every single day I take krill oil every single day I have discipline and I drink milk every day that's a lot that's a lot of daily the one a discipline I don't necessarily drink this one every day I got to take that back because there's some days where I don't drink discipline or take discipline go but even I don't do that I usually have some talk away we all did we didn't know how bad it was we ran up asking where is he where is he they just pointed at all the pieces on the ground she fell back into shock and that was all we could get but that was enough information for the statement and then after a few minutes when she asked to leave she did by the front doors by the duty hut the major and I walked out to the processing floor and witnessed something that to this day I would never forget something that has haunted and will always haunt me to the end of my days black vinyl bags of nothing but a friend's body parts burnt torn bits of camouflage clothing and destroyed gear out of all the deaths that I had been surrounded by and all my time over here and in all my tours never had I seen anyone in such shape so catastrophically shattered I really think that in that long stare across the floor which took maybe only a minute or two I instantly felt myself age in a flash I felt as if all my youth and vigor for life had been sacked from me by one horrific scene in those hundred twenty seconds I knew that I never wanted to devote myself to such ugly work ever again in those hundred twenty seconds I knew that I was sick of death in all of its forms and in those hundred twenty seconds I knew I would never ever be the same and you know war doesn't stop and four days after Master Sergeant Angus died going back to the book the rear door slammed as they entered interrupting the unusual quiet and gaining the attention of all of us who called the CP home just as they did over a hundred times the team on duty carried in one litter with a large zipped up block black body bag on top and then gently lowered him onto the litter stance the processing was moving along I checked the penmanship lined by line to see if it was all legible if everything was spelled correctly and if they had used capital lettering for each entry as the regs mandated and you know we've been here for three and a half hours I just want to say thank you for coming on thank you for writing this book that tells the story of you know it's not just your story and you just point you just pointed out it's not just your story it's a story that so many people have gone through it's a story that if you don't know it you don't know it and that's a problem so many incredible sacrifices so thank you for coming thank you for writing the book and most of all thanks for your service and your sacrifice and to close this out of course separate for Dallas brother separate five and with that gunny L Christian busler Chris Bustler has left the building and heavy very heavy subject time for a little decompression which you're in charge of echo tross just proceed down the path of decompression for that though all right but how could we every inch of this road could be wired to blow so you guys wrap up that you guys finally have everyone and now well there's a situation that unfolds here's the problem staff sergeant we only brought enough vehicles to transport my security team out of here we were already out here at the scene last night and nobody at higher headquarters told us that they were going to fly you guys all the way out here to join us how we didn't even know that you guys what that you guys were even going to be here until you showed up at camp correct or we just do not have enough room to take the remains and all of you back to base we need to figure out a way to do that we can't make two trips so basically you're all out there you got the remains now and I'm thinking all of the things that could have happened like did his remains get ejected or we waiting for a video to show up with a captured set of remains were they gonna booby trap his remains and for us to go out there and find him and try to get more of us are they gonna ransom it you know what are they gonna do and and this all these different scenarios are popping up and and all of them were viable but we had no idea it's like he just disappeared you know nobody ever thought that a person could literally melt through a vehicle and what we were looking at it crazy crazy you guys and again this just kind of goes to the nature of the war that was happening in Alambar province and in Ramadhi you guys go back to Ramadhi again to get another blown up Bradley and we do that by living our lives to the fullest every second, every minute, every day, four those heroes make your life count this book will absolutely give you an appreciation it gives you a glimpse into these from it gives you a glimpse in the war, give you a glimpse into these sacrifices and as I said at the beginning of this the sacrifices aren't they don't end on the battlefield in many ways they start on the battlefield because the families have to carry on and like I said this book will remind you of what you got you got a website called notufferduty no tufferduty.com you're on Twitter, Facebook, Twitter is no tougher duty, Facebook is no tougher duty, no greater honor, Instagram is no underscore tougher underscore duty come sure people are going to want to reach out to you and communicate with you and talk to you you've been through some you know you've been an off-close and personal with a nightmare with a nightmare and it's not just me and I wanted to not be a sad story I wanted to be able to get back into living again not just being trapped inside my own four walls so through the book and through therapy and at the end of the book I'm thanking all the people that really you know sacrifice their time because they thought I was worth it you know when did you lose your dad 20 11 February of 2011 we would we would we would go in the work just like how we did before the war started we would you know I would pick him up we would go in one just days I would drive over to his place I mean literally you can walk in from one end to the other end with your arm straight out and not touch a thing it was totally wide open just like the other one was and you know and there was remains you know pretty much everywhere it was just a bad scene it might have taken maybe 30 minutes before EOD was done we had to start counting the remains so that we had all seven accounted for sergeant Kinley, Corporal Thomas and I began to search the incident site while each of us counted out loud cautiously crawling into the Bradley barely able to distinguish human remains from the charred remains of the tankled mess of burn wires and jagged metal the vehicle commander is already recovered so that makes one there's the driver he makes two a few seconds went by there's three four and five a few more moments went by and six I think and you did it the right way got him the break that he needed and this is something I talk about all the time is just like a car if you they check engine light comes on you got it you got to get it off the highway you got to get it serviced and if you get it serviced it'll be okay check light engine goes off you can take that thing back on the road again if you keep driving it when that check engine light comes on and then the temperature gauge comes on and then the oil pressure gauge comes on and you keep driving that thing you're going to destroy that vehicle thank you thank you for everything that you and you guys you and your guys are doing to bring him home really thank you for everything you're doing for all these guys you guys come all the way out here and risk your lives to get my buddies out I cannot thank you enough for doing this it really means a lot and then kaboon ground shook my heart stopped the ripples of concussive shockwave went through my innards uncomfortably tickling my stomach in my anxiety shot through the roof everyone got down and took cover behind anything the conservatives protection the tank record operator still kept walking on the open road back towards the record not at all influenced by the explosion his mind was struck by grief the blast might as well been a cool breeze and he looked as if he didn't care there was another ied that blew up on the tail end of the perimeter no one got hurt just a little shaken no one could relax well dad I wrote down all the stories that you wanted to know I just wish you were still here to read them and I also want to just you know you you have the book dedication here it says this book is dedicated to those who had shed their life's blood and defensive carnation to those loved ones who went for them and to those who ensured that they were returned home with honor so you know as much as I I think as much as I talk about the immense cost of war there's really just no way to capture and describe and properly communicate the impact that war has and and so my team is ready to do a they know for just like how we did in Ramadhi the other one for them to bring the vehicle to us on a low boy and for us to work so we were up the whole night prior working on other remains and you know getting those guys going home then all of a sudden we're standing a team up we're gonna go out my I have the answers that a lot of families, gold star families want to know they want to know how with their son or daughter taking care of when they lost her lives and my book stells that that they were surrounded by the ones that they loved and who loved them and I wanted them to know that the very last hands to touch and in our rack were carrying hands we were the ones willing to die to make sure that they got home and I wasn't going to give the satisfaction to the bad guys to let them use that as a recruiting tool that you know they just missed up these guys and I didn't want them to know how how bad they hurt these guys so I said no it's it's a whole bunch of other people who sacrifice their lives to ensure this they dedicated their lives to this mission and I'm thank you for allowing me to be that voice for them as well because throughout history it's always been an unsung heroes that they dedicate their lives to make sure these guys get home you know and thank you and the other closing thoughts I would like to thank the 0445 club Miss Elzarka my brother Sean Busler Paul Slade out there in South Africa you know thank you for all the support that in reaching out and getting me out here and and keeping up with me at home and we used to have all these big philosophy, philosophical conversations and you go you know what I know what you need I'm like what you need to start writing I'm like now I'm good man I'm out of writer a barely past high school English so he goes no that is what helped me when I was when I came back from Vietnam so period of time goes by but I know that if I was to give him a call three of them morning he's always going to be there and I think that's what really is is the key behind other people they need to have that family around them of support that you know they had a wife that she never gave up on me she always was there to to make sure I was taking my meds and make sure that I had somebody to talk to you if I needed to talk to one of the she would call up one of the Marines a bedlack he would come over and and I needed somebody to talk to you right thing who was there I didn't really know about all the running and all the, you know, hundred pound packs and, you know, going out for 27 miles and stuff like that. I think you call that a mystery a second ago of unraddling that first or unraveling that first Bradley the missing guy the MIA and you do a great job of going in those details it's a powerful story um that you cover I wanted I knew I was maybe their family members or the members of that unit would pick this up and would read it now I wanted to know let them to know that what how we saw it from our end that we weren't trying to not do our jobs that we were doing everything humanly possible to get him home and now I am reinventing myself and it's through you know people who love me and you know and people that have met and they've always been there for me and and going through the book and pulling out that jumble of experiences and pulling it out like a thread and being able to work on that hey you know your your buddies did where you know I wanted to be there for him and to be there to support him and because I knew it was going to be a huge deal our job isn't an easy one and when you realize that your buddies are there you know being worked on that takes it to a whole new level but I felt like it wasn't finished and after the five weeks of recovery you know I think back at maybe it was his spirit letting me know that here this is where I am don't quit don't quit you know now and then we were already associated with the EOD guys there are our buddies they would come over and hang out with us we go to their place and until you know after Angus got killed and they hooked up and then you know and once I realized who it was you know so we were both right that they treated the one out there as a torso as an angel and we did too and what had happened to the gunner was the ID breached right behind where he sat and when the vehicle melted it carried the bones out underneath the vehicle and it got in case under 12 inches of slag metal underneath the vehicle and it's first time we've ever ever seen anything like that you know we hit that piece sledge hammers try to break it and stuff you know I could talk you know if you want to talk about you know I didn't see anything that you like you saw yeah canley knew Doug's wife you know he knew you know it's been all this whole time together and didn't even know that each other the two of them were on the same base so it was it's more about the getting more like to to basically improve the quality of your own being kind of thing with whether it be giving others more or being in touch with like your temperer and like it's basically like who you're on the inside kind of thing and then maybe you know they're violating and that makes sense you know because they're like hey podcasts over when to this support mode is listed on the things it's like boom next up but done I get it Get off the back of duty go back to your regular lives there was nothing no gradual time you know I let them know that our first sergeant that I wasn't ready you know People forget that you know even preparing for something like this, we would always come out here to camp pelton and we would get ready to get trained and they were like, oh, what do you guys do? Now, of course, people like to talk now about the weapons of mass destruction, which you know, there was isolated things that were found, but you know, there wasn't, he never attacked US forces or coalition forces with weapons of mass destruction. oh this is not really part of him right right not part of exactly right it doesn't match exactly exactly right that's what I'm saying so the so the the creased or folded creases in the flags that that have been packaged how he said out of a box or something like that that feeling is really prevalent when you see the creases and something it's kind of like Here's someone, you know, some senior person back there is going, you know what, this war is going to be over pretty quick. so what they think is a piece of plastic silicon could actually be built and so they wanted people who were experienced to know what what is what and be able to capture everything that we could and but that scene was literally catastrophic it was the biggest idea creator I've ever seen you say here I was shaking from the cold shaking from the declining adrenaline shaking from the over consumption of coffee and shaking from the terrible fear of my impending death my stomach turned a nervous caffeine laden reflux up my digestive track that only pride kept down I'd taken too many chances in my tours over here I'd overplayed too many hands and this was my last of nine lives this was Ramadhi the devil's playground luck as a shelf life and mine was set to expire my only two hopes were that when the end came it would come fast and my body would be viewable so my family at home could have the luxury of closure each breath
