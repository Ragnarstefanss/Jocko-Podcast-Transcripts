00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.56 This is Jocopotcast number 178.
00:00:03.56 --> 00:00:06.72 With echo Charles, it me, Jocco Willink.
00:00:06.72 --> 00:00:08.12 Good evening, echo.
00:00:08.12 --> 00:00:10.96 Good evening.
00:00:10.96 --> 00:00:14.88 Honorable Mother and Father.
00:00:14.88 --> 00:00:21.40 The difficulty of the journey you made to see me was clearly evident in your disheveled
00:00:21.40 --> 00:00:26.68 hair and in the hollows under your eyes.
00:00:26.68 --> 00:00:32.60 It made me want to bend my knees and worship before you.
00:00:32.60 --> 00:00:39.92 In the wrinkles on your brows was vivid testimony of the pains you took to raise me.
00:00:39.92 --> 00:00:49.56 Words could not express my feelings and what little I did say was superficial in the extreme.
00:00:49.56 --> 00:00:54.36 Yet although a cutely conscious of how little time we had, I saw in your eyes and in
00:00:54.36 --> 00:01:00.84 your gaze all you wanted to say, but couldn't.
00:01:00.84 --> 00:01:06.72 When you took my hand, I experienced a sense of profound peacefulness unlike anything I've
00:01:06.72 --> 00:01:13.56 experienced since joining up, like being a baby again and longing for the warmth of a mother's
00:01:13.56 --> 00:01:16.000 love.
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.04 It is because I bask in the beauty of your deep devotion that I can margar myself for you.
00:01:24.04 --> 00:01:31.76 For in death, I will sleep in the world of your love.
00:01:31.76 --> 00:01:34.68 Honorable Mother.
00:01:34.68 --> 00:01:40.08 Even if I was never able to fully accept the love you gave me, I received so much wisdom
00:01:40.08 --> 00:01:42.88 from you.
00:01:42.88 --> 00:01:50.40 And Father, your silent words are carved deeply into my heart.
00:01:50.40 --> 00:01:57.76 If this I will be able to fight together with both of you, even if I should die, it will
00:01:57.76 --> 00:02:01.44 be with a peaceful spirit.
00:02:01.44 --> 00:02:04.72 I mean this with all my heart.
00:02:04.72 --> 00:02:11.32 The war zone is where these beautiful emotions are put to the test.
00:02:11.32 --> 00:02:18.84 If death means a return to this world of love, there is no need for me to fear.
00:02:18.84 --> 00:02:29.76 There is nothing left to do, but press on, then fulfill my duty.
00:02:29.76 --> 00:02:41.88 And that is the final letter written by a man named Captain Adachi Takoya.
00:02:41.88 --> 00:02:45.40 It was written obviously to his parents.
00:02:45.40 --> 00:02:52.40 And he was assigned to Kamakaze special attack group number one.
00:02:52.40 --> 00:02:55.40 And he did carry out his mission.
00:02:55.40 --> 00:03:04.68 A suicide attack on one of the US Navy vessels in the vicinity of Okinawa on 28 April 1945.
00:03:04.68 --> 00:03:12.92 He was 23 years old, which is actually pretty old for a Kamakaze.
00:03:12.92 --> 00:03:16.28 There is another last letter home.
00:03:16.28 --> 00:03:23.80 This one's from Ensin Kiyoshi Agawa, Father and Mother.
00:03:23.80 --> 00:03:30.68 It has been decided that I also will make a swordie as a proud special attack core member.
00:03:30.68 --> 00:03:35.56 Looking back when I think of your raising me in your arms for more than 20 years, I am
00:03:35.56 --> 00:03:38.44 filled with a sense of gratitude.
00:03:38.44 --> 00:03:43.28 I truly believe that no one else has lived at happier life than me, and I am resolved
00:03:43.28 --> 00:03:49.68 to repay the emperor and my father for your kindness.
00:03:49.68 --> 00:03:56.84 Beyond those boundless white clouds, I will make my attack with a calm feeling.
00:03:56.84 --> 00:04:00.36 Not even thoughts of life and death will come to my mind.
00:04:00.36 --> 00:04:03.96 A person dies once.
00:04:03.96 --> 00:04:11.08 It will be an honorable day to live for the eternal cause.
00:04:11.08 --> 00:04:17.48 Father and Mother, please be glad for me.
00:04:17.48 --> 00:04:21.76 Above all, Mother, please take care of your health.
00:04:21.76 --> 00:04:27.12 And I wish for everyone's prosperity.
00:04:27.12 --> 00:04:32.68 Father and Mother, I always and forever will be living near you.
00:04:32.68 --> 00:04:35.52 I will be praying.
00:04:35.52 --> 00:04:46.04 I will go smiling both on the day of my swordie and forever.
00:04:46.04 --> 00:04:56.32 And Ensin Ogawa was the pilot of the second plane to hit the USS bunker hill.
00:04:56.32 --> 00:05:05.24 And that Kamikaze attack killed 393 and wounded 264 and took the aircraft carrier out of
00:05:05.24 --> 00:05:10.88 commission for the duration of the war.
00:05:10.88 --> 00:05:14.72 Most of the Kamikaze were young.
00:05:14.72 --> 00:05:21.20 They were sometimes 17, but usually 1819, maybe 20 years old.
00:05:21.20 --> 00:05:25.12 They all wrote final letters home.
00:05:25.12 --> 00:05:32.16 All letters generally spoke of their commitment to the Emperor, their commitment to the
00:05:32.16 --> 00:05:34.64 Japan, their commitment to their parents.
00:05:34.64 --> 00:05:39.64 And there's a lot of these letters.
00:05:39.64 --> 00:05:40.88 There's thousands of them.
00:05:40.88 --> 00:05:45.68 And it's actually when you sit there and read them, it's actually kind of seconding
00:05:45.68 --> 00:05:46.80 to read these letters.
00:05:46.80 --> 00:05:52.88 These young boys, they're brainwashed.
00:05:52.88 --> 00:06:02.40 I know some people find some level of honor in the Kamikaze pilots.
00:06:02.40 --> 00:06:05.40 They sacrificed for their country.
00:06:05.40 --> 00:06:08.64 They put service above themselves for their Emperor.
00:06:08.64 --> 00:06:15.28 I've hard time with that.
00:06:15.28 --> 00:06:16.48 These are kids, right?
00:06:16.48 --> 00:06:19.12 These are pawns.
00:06:19.12 --> 00:06:22.56 And actually they weren't even that effective.
00:06:22.56 --> 00:06:29.56 They had a hit ratio of about 14%.
00:06:29.56 --> 00:06:35.08 There was 2,800 Kamikaze pilots that were killed.
00:06:35.08 --> 00:06:43.000 And they killed about 4,900 sailors, US Navy sailors.
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.08 And God bless all those brave sailors.
00:06:46.08 --> 00:06:53.08 Every one of those losses and deaths is a tragedy.
00:06:53.08 --> 00:07:00.52 And the US Navy in World War II and the Navy in general in World War II was a nightmare.
00:07:00.52 --> 00:07:13.20 The Kamikaze sank 34 ships, which is horrible, but it actually wasn't a game changer.
00:07:13.20 --> 00:07:20.20 But these suicide bombers, you know, you've got to think about how they ended up in that
00:07:20.20 --> 00:07:21.20 situation.
00:07:21.20 --> 00:07:23.76 And I don't like suicide bombers at all.
00:07:23.76 --> 00:07:28.76 And I guess I have a biased against suicide bombers.
00:07:28.76 --> 00:07:29.76 Fine.
00:07:29.76 --> 00:07:33.56 There was a lot of suicide bombers in Ramadi.
00:07:33.56 --> 00:07:38.000 And some people, like I said, some people trying to glorify a suicide bomber, whether
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.64 it's a Kamikaze, or whether it's a modern day, suicide bomber.
00:07:41.64 --> 00:07:44.60 They tried to glorify them, but there's no glory.
00:07:44.60 --> 00:07:54.000 The modern suicide bombers are either cowards that are afraid to face their enemies in
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.24 battle.
00:07:56.24 --> 00:07:59.40 And what's really sad is that's rare.
00:07:59.40 --> 00:08:06.20 More than likely, the modern suicide bomber that you're dealing with is an actual victim,
00:08:06.20 --> 00:08:15.76 himself, who is usually a young kid, been manipulated and lied to and or, or I should say,
00:08:15.76 --> 00:08:19.96 also coerced through threats.
00:08:19.96 --> 00:08:21.60 And that happened all the time.
00:08:21.60 --> 00:08:24.32 It was like, hey, if you don't carry out this suicide mission, we're going to kill
00:08:24.32 --> 00:08:26.64 your family.
00:08:26.64 --> 00:08:31.72 And so you might as well, you might as well do it.
00:08:31.72 --> 00:08:34.80 So that's what you're dealing with.
00:08:34.80 --> 00:08:38.000 But some of them, you know, sometimes people just get straight up brainwashed.
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.64 And it's the same thing with the Japanese Kamikaze's.
00:08:42.64 --> 00:08:49.36 I would say a lot less on the coercion side.
00:08:49.36 --> 00:08:52.24 You know, like, it wasn't like they were holding their family, but they did a great
00:08:52.24 --> 00:08:59.92 job of brainwashed these kids.
00:08:59.92 --> 00:09:03.60 And I'm no expert.
00:09:03.60 --> 00:09:05.08 I should have said that straight out of the gate.
00:09:05.08 --> 00:09:10.000 I'm just giving you my opinion, my, my thoughts about it.
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:19.56 There's some Japanese documents that I think paint a pretty clear picture of kind
00:09:19.56 --> 00:09:25.24 of the, the foundation of what the Japanese military was taught.
00:09:25.24 --> 00:09:27.80 And it's why they were, why they fought to the death.
00:09:27.80 --> 00:09:30.60 And there's a lot of propaganda that you can look at too.
00:09:30.60 --> 00:09:35.96 The propaganda that, you know, explains Americans as these evil people that were going
00:09:35.96 --> 00:09:39.68 to come and rape their women and knew it's better to die.
00:09:39.68 --> 00:09:40.52 So there's that.
00:09:40.52 --> 00:09:48.72 But there's, there's a more foundational thing I think that was printed in World War
00:09:48.72 --> 00:09:49.72 II.
00:09:49.72 --> 00:09:55.96 And it was called the Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors.
00:09:55.96 --> 00:09:58.92 And a rescript is like an official guidance.
00:09:58.92 --> 00:10:03.12 It's like this is the word from the boss.
00:10:03.12 --> 00:10:08.92 And it included in it something called the Sengikan, which, which meant instructions for
00:10:08.92 --> 00:10:10.48 the battlefield.
00:10:10.48 --> 00:10:17.52 And which we're about this document is it's got a lot of really, a lot of stuff in it
00:10:17.52 --> 00:10:23.40 that's when you hear it, it sounds, for like a little better word, it sounds good.
00:10:23.40 --> 00:10:28.60 The kind of thing that you think, oh, wow, that's, that's, that's honorable, that's good.
00:10:28.60 --> 00:10:33.08 It's very idealistic.
00:10:33.08 --> 00:10:38.84 And, and I think if this document, this Imperial rescript to Soldiers and Sailors, if it
00:10:38.84 --> 00:10:43.48 actually would have been followed, the, a lot of the problems, a lot of the atrocities that
00:10:43.48 --> 00:10:47.64 were committed wouldn't happen.
00:10:47.64 --> 00:10:58.56 Because the document, as you're going to hear, is a, is a, it's a fairly positive document.
00:10:58.56 --> 00:11:05.84 And I think sometimes people take and they hold up that attitude, that kind of
00:11:05.84 --> 00:11:09.52 Bushido attitude and hold it up on a pedestal.
00:11:09.52 --> 00:11:15.32 And like I said, I get it because when you, when you look at it on its own, you think, wow,
00:11:15.32 --> 00:11:17.48 this is, this is a good thing.
00:11:17.48 --> 00:11:21.32 This is a positive thing.
00:11:21.32 --> 00:11:29.20 But what you can't forget is that it's this attitude of, this attitude and this culture
00:11:29.20 --> 00:11:34.16 of extreme obedience, right, extreme obedience.
00:11:34.16 --> 00:11:38.52 I talk all the time about how you've got to question your leaders, right?
00:11:38.52 --> 00:11:43.56 And I talk all the time how if, if you're told to do something that's unethical or illegal
00:11:43.56 --> 00:11:50.88 or immoral, it is your obligation and your duty to disobey.
00:11:50.88 --> 00:11:52.80 So they, they didn't have that attitude.
00:11:52.80 --> 00:11:56.24 Their attitude was 100% obedience.
00:11:56.24 --> 00:12:01.84 They also had the strong attitude of ethnic superiority.
00:12:01.84 --> 00:12:08.16 So they, the Japanese people thought that their race and their ethnicity was superior to
00:12:08.16 --> 00:12:11.40 everyone else's.
00:12:11.40 --> 00:12:17.28 And that attitude led to things like these common, common cause, pilots.
00:12:17.28 --> 00:12:27.000 And it led to atrocities like the raponang king and like unit 731, a just horror, horror
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:34.32 show atrocities with the darkest evil imaginable.
00:12:34.32 --> 00:12:45.16 And you know, podcast 60, raponang king, podcast 133, unit 731.
00:12:45.16 --> 00:12:49.92 If you listen to those, you don't, you can't listen to those and feel normal when you're
00:12:49.92 --> 00:12:50.76 done listening to it.
00:12:50.76 --> 00:12:54.40 You can't.
00:12:54.40 --> 00:13:05.32 They're disturbing to listen to when you see how evil human beings can be to other human beings.
00:13:05.32 --> 00:13:16.60 So like I said, when you hear this imperial rescript, it, it sounds positive.
00:13:16.60 --> 00:13:22.92 A lot of it sounds good, but first of all, it wasn't followed.
00:13:22.92 --> 00:13:27.72 Because some, some of the positive parts of the code that they clearly did not listen
00:13:27.72 --> 00:13:29.36 to.
00:13:29.36 --> 00:13:35.88 And then other parts of the code that are positive, like anything that's positive, if you
00:13:35.88 --> 00:13:39.32 let it go too far, then it becomes a negative.
00:13:39.32 --> 00:13:47.44 And that's seems to me what happened, at least in some sense an imperial Japan.
00:13:47.44 --> 00:13:54.08 So I think this document kind of reveals how they framed their mindset.
00:13:54.08 --> 00:13:58.56 And there's like I said, there's lessons in here to learn and think about things that
00:13:58.56 --> 00:14:04.48 you can take away that you say, that's a good policy.
00:14:04.48 --> 00:14:11.36 But you can also see that when it's taken to the extreme, it becomes the framework for
00:14:11.36 --> 00:14:17.28 imperial Japan to become the sadistic evil that they originally believed they were fighting
00:14:17.28 --> 00:14:18.28 against.
00:14:18.28 --> 00:14:24.44 So let's get into it the imperial rescript to soldiers and sailor sailors.
00:14:24.44 --> 00:14:26.08 Here we go, introduction.
00:14:26.08 --> 00:14:32.84 The battle is where the imperial army acting under the imperial command displays its true
00:14:32.84 --> 00:14:36.56 character conquering.
00:14:36.56 --> 00:14:43.40 Whenever it attacks, winning whenever it engages in combat in order to spread codeau.
00:14:43.40 --> 00:14:47.04 And so codeau is the imperial way.
00:14:47.04 --> 00:14:48.04 That's what it means.
00:14:48.04 --> 00:14:49.60 And that's how they describe it.
00:14:49.60 --> 00:14:54.68 But what's interesting is it literally means like a fragrance, like a smell.
00:14:54.68 --> 00:14:58.20 So it's like the scent, the spirit, the heartbeat.
00:14:58.20 --> 00:14:59.52 So that's what codeau is.
00:14:59.52 --> 00:15:04.36 They want to spread the codeau far and wide so that the enemy may look up in awe to the
00:15:04.36 --> 00:15:08.76 august virtues of his majesty.
00:15:08.76 --> 00:15:14.08 Those who marched to the battlefield, therefore should endeavor to exalt throughout the world.
00:15:14.08 --> 00:15:20.04 The glories of the empire by fully realizing what the country stands for and firmly upholding
00:15:20.04 --> 00:15:24.36 the moral tenets of the imperial army.
00:15:24.36 --> 00:15:29.28 The imperial rescript to the armed forces is explicit.
00:15:29.28 --> 00:15:34.08 While regulations and manuals clearly defined conduct and combat and methods of training,
00:15:34.08 --> 00:15:39.56 conditions in the combat zone, however tend to cause soldiers to be swayed by immediate
00:15:39.56 --> 00:15:43.64 events and become forgetful of their duty.
00:15:43.64 --> 00:15:47.000 Indeed they should be wary.
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.04 Indeed they should be wary there, less they run counter to their duties as soldiers.
00:15:52.04 --> 00:15:58.000 The purpose of this code lies in providing concrete rules of conduct in the light of past
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.60 experience so that those in the zone of combat may wholly abide by the imperial rescript
00:16:04.60 --> 00:16:11.000 to enhance the moral virtues of the imperial army.
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.76 So hey, combat's going to be tough and you may forget your morals that they're talking
00:16:17.76 --> 00:16:24.20 about moral virtues and so we're saying hey, combat's going to be hard.
00:16:24.20 --> 00:16:28.36 It's going to be chaotic and when you get in that tough situation, you may forget your
00:16:28.36 --> 00:16:32.000 morals and so this guide right here is going to help you keep you on track.
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.16 That's what it's going to do.
00:16:33.16 --> 00:16:34.72 That's the idea here.
00:16:34.72 --> 00:16:38.44 Chapter one, the empire.
00:16:38.44 --> 00:16:45.44 Japan is the cocoa coup, which means the empire.
00:16:45.44 --> 00:16:51.64 The tenu, which is the Emperor of Japan, rules over it ever lastingly in a line unbroken
00:16:51.64 --> 00:16:57.000 through the ages as the successor in the high and broad cause established by the imperial
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.52 ancestor at the time of the founding of the empire.
00:17:01.52 --> 00:17:07.52 Imperial benevolence is extended to all without favor while the imperial virtues in light
00:17:07.52 --> 00:17:09.68 in the world.
00:17:09.68 --> 00:17:18.08 The people to handing down from traditions of loyalty, filial piety and valor from generation
00:17:18.08 --> 00:17:27.48 to generation and enhancing thereby their moral peculiar to the empire have assisted the
00:17:27.48 --> 00:17:34.20 throne, a perfect national unity under the throne, which has brought about the present
00:17:34.20 --> 00:17:36.56 national prosperity.
00:17:36.56 --> 00:17:40.68 They go back to a racial thing.
00:17:40.68 --> 00:17:50.80 This is an unbroken, unbroken line of royalty, per thousands of years.
00:17:50.80 --> 00:17:54.92 That's why we're here and they've been so benevolent.
00:17:54.92 --> 00:17:58.44 That's why we're living a good life right now.
00:17:58.44 --> 00:18:02.72 Soldiers on the field should seek to achieve with unshakable determination their mission
00:18:02.72 --> 00:18:09.96 of defending the empire by laying to heart the essential character of the national policy.
00:18:09.96 --> 00:18:16.96 The army under command of the emperor assists in furthering the imperial fortunes by enhancing
00:18:16.96 --> 00:18:24.12 the glories of the empire through the embodiment of the lofty spirit of valor.
00:18:24.12 --> 00:18:28.04 This spirit is the basic factor in realizing universal peace.
00:18:28.04 --> 00:18:33.16 We're fighting for peace over here. That's what we're doing. For this spirit of justice
00:18:33.16 --> 00:18:40.44 combined with valor and of valor tampered by benevolence in conformity with the imperial
00:18:40.44 --> 00:18:41.44 wishes.
00:18:41.44 --> 00:18:43.04 This is all good.
00:18:43.04 --> 00:18:44.24 That's where we're at.
00:18:44.24 --> 00:18:45.24 This is all good.
00:18:45.24 --> 00:18:46.84 This is a benevolent leader.
00:18:46.84 --> 00:18:53.68 You've got the spirit of the army is actually just the reflection, the arm of this benevolence
00:18:53.68 --> 00:18:57.72 that's going to go out and bring the spirit of peace to the world.
00:18:57.72 --> 00:18:58.72 valor.
00:18:58.72 --> 00:19:00.68 Then we get into it a little bit.
00:19:00.68 --> 00:19:03.32 Valor requires strickeness.
00:19:03.32 --> 00:19:08.24 While benevolence must be universal, should there be an enemy who dares oppose the imperial
00:19:08.24 --> 00:19:09.24 army?
00:19:09.24 --> 00:19:15.64 The army must resolutely resort to force of arms and deal him a crushing blow.
00:19:15.64 --> 00:19:17.88 We took a little one, 80, I didn't win.
00:19:17.88 --> 00:19:21.08 Hey, we're all about getting our peace on.
00:19:21.08 --> 00:19:25.60 But if you oppose, if you dare to oppose the imperial army, you can get a crushing
00:19:25.60 --> 00:19:26.60 blow.
00:19:26.60 --> 00:19:27.60 That's how we're rolling.
00:19:27.60 --> 00:19:34.88 However, even though force may compel the enemy to submit, should a lapse of virtue,
00:19:34.88 --> 00:19:39.32 should a lapse of invert you occur by the striking of those who do not resist or by failure
00:19:39.32 --> 00:19:45.68 to show kindness to those who surrender, it cannot be said that such an army is perfect.
00:19:45.68 --> 00:19:49.96 So there we got, we're going to take care of the people that if you surrender, you're
00:19:49.96 --> 00:19:51.76 good.
00:19:51.76 --> 00:19:54.52 If you don't resist, you won't be harmed, right?
00:19:54.52 --> 00:19:56.80 So we're like a benevolent army.
00:19:56.80 --> 00:20:00.000 If you stand up to us, we're going to crush you, but if not, it's cool.
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.68 We're going to take care of you.
00:20:02.68 --> 00:20:08.96 Here's modest in its strength, unostintacious in its kindness.
00:20:08.96 --> 00:20:16.48 The imperial army becomes an objective admiration when it quietly displays its valor
00:20:16.48 --> 00:20:17.76 and benevolence.
00:20:17.76 --> 00:20:18.76 So here we are.
00:20:18.76 --> 00:20:19.76 You know what to say in here?
00:20:19.76 --> 00:20:20.76 Gotta be humble.
00:20:20.76 --> 00:20:21.76 I say that all the time.
00:20:21.76 --> 00:20:22.76 Gotta be humble.
00:20:22.76 --> 00:20:23.76 That's what they're saying.
00:20:23.76 --> 00:20:25.56 You gotta be modest.
00:20:25.56 --> 00:20:29.000 You gotta, you gotta quietly display your strength, right?
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000 Sure.
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000 Just be modest.
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.92 We agree with that.
00:20:32.92 --> 00:20:38.92 The mission of the imperial army lies in making the imperial virtues, the objects
00:20:38.92 --> 00:20:46.08 of universal admiration through the exercise of justice tempered with mercy.
00:20:46.08 --> 00:20:54.52 Obviously, the folks in the NANDKING did not get this message.
00:20:54.52 --> 00:20:55.52 They were disciplined.
00:20:55.52 --> 00:20:59.04 And actually, they truly didn't because of this, this wasn't released when the
00:20:59.04 --> 00:21:00.44 RAPINAN KING took place.
00:21:00.44 --> 00:21:01.76 This hadn't come out yet.
00:21:01.76 --> 00:21:07.72 So they truly did not get the memo of this at that time.
00:21:07.72 --> 00:21:10.04 Discipline.
00:21:10.04 --> 00:21:15.68 The essence of discipline in the imperial army lies in the lofty spirit of complete obedience
00:21:15.68 --> 00:21:20.44 to his majesty.
00:21:20.44 --> 00:21:21.80 There you go.
00:21:21.80 --> 00:21:26.52 The essence of discipline in the imperial army lies in the lofty spirit of complete obedience
00:21:26.52 --> 00:21:27.52 to his majesty.
00:21:27.52 --> 00:21:35.48 High and low must have deeply engraved in their minds, the solemnly of the right of command.
00:21:35.48 --> 00:21:39.92 Those above who should exercise the right in all seriousness while those below should obey
00:21:39.92 --> 00:21:44.36 the commands in utmost sincerity.
00:21:44.36 --> 00:21:49.000 Essential of victory and requisite for maintaining peace is the condition where in the
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:57.44 entire army united in the bonds of absolute loyalty moves as one in response to a command.
00:21:57.44 --> 00:22:00.28 So this is where we're getting into it.
00:22:00.28 --> 00:22:06.76 Even the US military, you've got to obey the lawful orders of the people appointed above
00:22:06.76 --> 00:22:07.76 you.
00:22:07.76 --> 00:22:08.76 The lawful orders.
00:22:08.76 --> 00:22:12.76 That's the oath that you swear is that you obey the lawful orders.
00:22:12.76 --> 00:22:18.68 Doesn't just say, oh, bay, especially on the battlefield is the utmost
00:22:18.68 --> 00:22:22.000 observance of the spirit of obedience necessary.
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.08 The spirit of the soldier's bestics exemplified by those who silently do their duty, joyfully
00:22:28.08 --> 00:22:33.72 braving death in obedience to a command given at a time when they are undergoing great
00:22:33.72 --> 00:22:34.72 hardships.
00:22:34.72 --> 00:22:42.20 There's no more important time that you need to obey than on the battlefield.
00:22:42.20 --> 00:22:50.44 The next section, unity, the army looks up in awe to his majesty as its august head.
00:22:50.44 --> 00:22:57.88 It will be united in compliance with the imperial will as one in spirit and in body and
00:22:57.88 --> 00:23:02.04 in single-hearted loyalty.
00:23:02.04 --> 00:23:06.68 In keeping with the basic principles of command and army units should form a solid yet
00:23:06.68 --> 00:23:12.000 genial group with its commander as its center.
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.88 It is essential that each man, high and low, doodifully observing his place, should be determined
00:23:17.88 --> 00:23:23.64 always to sacrifice himself for the whole in accordance with the intentions of the commander
00:23:23.64 --> 00:23:29.68 by reposing every confidence in his comrades and without giving even the slightest thought
00:23:29.68 --> 00:23:36.16 to personal interest and to life or death.
00:23:36.16 --> 00:23:43.000 So hey, I'm a firm believer.
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000 In fact I think that's what makes a good team player is someone that puts the team above
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.96 themselves.
00:23:49.96 --> 00:23:52.32 No doubt about that's also what makes a good leader.
00:23:52.32 --> 00:23:58.24 Someone that puts the team's mission and the people on the team above themselves.
00:23:58.24 --> 00:24:01.92 That's I agree with that.
00:24:01.92 --> 00:24:08.24 I guess we're going a little next level here, maybe a little bit.
00:24:08.24 --> 00:24:12.52 You got to see, here's the difference, I think, it's in this word determined to always
00:24:12.52 --> 00:24:14.48 to sacrifice for yourself for the whole.
00:24:14.48 --> 00:24:16.04 That's going to the next level, right?
00:24:16.04 --> 00:24:17.64 It's not like, hey, I'm putting the team first.
00:24:17.64 --> 00:24:20.08 It's like my goal is to sacrifice myself for the team.
00:24:20.08 --> 00:24:21.08 That's where I'm head.
00:24:21.08 --> 00:24:22.80 That's what I'm trying to make happen.
00:24:22.80 --> 00:24:24.08 That's a little different.
00:24:24.08 --> 00:24:27.68 That's the little next level.
00:24:27.68 --> 00:24:29.40 Cooperation, next section cooperation.
00:24:29.40 --> 00:24:35.12 Oldiers not only should be united in mind in carrying out their tasks, but should also
00:24:35.12 --> 00:24:41.48 display the spirit of cooperation by forgetting themselves for the sake of victory.
00:24:41.48 --> 00:24:46.40 Every unit should carry out its mission with responsibility upholding its honor, placing
00:24:46.40 --> 00:24:53.20 confidence in others, and assisting one another, volunteering to face hardships, exerting
00:24:53.20 --> 00:25:01.12 all its strength and cooperation and fighting valiantly to achieve its objective.
00:25:01.12 --> 00:25:03.56 Teamwork.
00:25:03.56 --> 00:25:04.92 That's what we're saying.
00:25:04.92 --> 00:25:07.32 We're talking about teamwork.
00:25:07.32 --> 00:25:10.60 We are going a little next level here because we're talking about forgetting yourselves
00:25:10.60 --> 00:25:14.16 for the sake of victory.
00:25:14.16 --> 00:25:18.32 That's a little next level.
00:25:18.32 --> 00:25:21.92 Volunteering to face hardships while everyone does that in the military.
00:25:21.92 --> 00:25:25.12 Being strengthened cooperation, yes, everyone does that in the military.
00:25:25.12 --> 00:25:26.76 Fighting valiantly to achieve its objective.
00:25:26.76 --> 00:25:30.72 Yes, everyone does that in the military.
00:25:30.72 --> 00:25:36.40 But forgetting yourself for the sake of victory, that's again.
00:25:36.40 --> 00:25:39.20 This is like, hey, I'm putting the team and the mission above me.
00:25:39.20 --> 00:25:41.28 I get that.
00:25:41.28 --> 00:25:43.68 We're not going to forget ourselves though.
00:25:43.68 --> 00:25:47.64 We're not just saying, okay, I don't exist.
00:25:47.64 --> 00:25:53.28 We're not giving up our personal spirit for the collective spirit.
00:25:53.28 --> 00:25:54.68 We're not doing that.
00:25:54.68 --> 00:25:57.68 We're only just reefers that we're not doing that in America.
00:25:57.68 --> 00:26:00.08 That's not what we're doing.
00:26:00.08 --> 00:26:02.28 We join together the collective spirit.
00:26:02.28 --> 00:26:05.72 We're not giving up ours.
00:26:05.72 --> 00:26:08.28 Next section, aggressiveness.
00:26:08.28 --> 00:26:11.52 Can't argue with aggressiveness.
00:26:11.52 --> 00:26:16.76 Aggressiveness should constantly prevail in combat, which must be carried out with bravery
00:26:16.76 --> 00:26:18.32 and determination.
00:26:18.32 --> 00:26:23.96 When attacking, be determined and positive, always taking the initiative, fighting vigorously
00:26:23.96 --> 00:26:28.84 and stubbornly vowing not to cease until the enemy is crushed.
00:26:28.84 --> 00:26:32.68 I got no issues with that.
00:26:32.68 --> 00:26:38.84 In defense, always retain the spirit of attack and always maintain freedom of action.
00:26:38.84 --> 00:26:41.08 Never give up a position.
00:26:41.08 --> 00:26:44.000 But rather die.
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.96 And pursuit be thorough and inexorable.
00:26:48.96 --> 00:26:52.76 So, yep, never give up position.
00:26:52.76 --> 00:26:54.48 It's better to die.
00:26:54.48 --> 00:26:59.24 And I think we talked about what we've definitely talked about that on the podcast.
00:26:59.24 --> 00:27:02.24 When is it intelligent to make a tactical retreat?
00:27:02.24 --> 00:27:05.08 There are times without question.
00:27:05.08 --> 00:27:09.44 And there's been times throughout history where tactical retreats, giving up positions
00:27:09.44 --> 00:27:13.96 has caused victory.
00:27:13.96 --> 00:27:17.80 The Imperial Japanese Army is not talking about that.
00:27:17.80 --> 00:27:21.88 They're talking about it's better to die.
00:27:21.88 --> 00:27:26.68 Continue on, act boldly, intent upon victory.
00:27:26.68 --> 00:27:28.52 Be fearless and calm.
00:27:28.52 --> 00:27:33.44 Meeting the situation courageously undergoing hardships with indomitable perseverance
00:27:33.44 --> 00:27:35.44 so as to overcome all obstacles.
00:27:35.44 --> 00:27:44.68 Hey, I'm good with that, right?
00:27:44.68 --> 00:27:46.12 That's what you got to do.
00:27:46.12 --> 00:27:49.52 Indomitable perseverance, overcome all obstacles.
00:27:49.52 --> 00:27:53.32 Good, the next section, conviction to win.
00:27:53.32 --> 00:27:56.32 Faith is strength.
00:27:56.32 --> 00:28:00.68 He who has faith in combat is always the victor.
00:28:00.68 --> 00:28:05.40 The conviction to win grows from constant and rigorous training.
00:28:05.40 --> 00:28:12.16 Help the strength to conquer the enemy by every possible effort and by improving every moment.
00:28:12.16 --> 00:28:14.44 Got no issues with that?
00:28:14.44 --> 00:28:15.44 Get better?
00:28:15.44 --> 00:28:16.44 Yeah, train hard.
00:28:16.44 --> 00:28:21.12 Rigorous, rigorous training is definitely going to get you ready for tough situations.
00:28:21.12 --> 00:28:25.92 You got to have faith in what you're doing for sure.
00:28:25.92 --> 00:28:30.32 The destiny of the Empire, Ress upon victory or defeat in battle.
00:28:30.32 --> 00:28:34.36 It's a heavy weight to bear.
00:28:34.36 --> 00:28:40.34 You not give up under any circumstances, keeping in your mind your responsibility to keep
00:28:40.34 --> 00:28:47.72 untarnished the glorious history of the Imperial Army with its tradition of invincibility.
00:28:47.72 --> 00:28:53.40 Yeah, that one's a stretch.
00:28:53.40 --> 00:29:02.44 We're taking a stretch now because I promise you the no man and no army is invincible.
00:29:02.44 --> 00:29:05.96 So again, it'll stretch there.
00:29:05.96 --> 00:29:10.60 Going a little too deep.
00:29:10.60 --> 00:29:18.52 Next section, chapter two and part one is called Piety.
00:29:18.52 --> 00:29:23.40 The gods look upon us from above.
00:29:23.40 --> 00:29:30.42 Be worthy of divine protection by being pure and heart, just an action, profound and
00:29:30.42 --> 00:29:39.98 sincere in your Piety, constantly mindful of the loyalty you owe the Emperor and of duty
00:29:39.98 --> 00:29:43.58 to your parents.
00:29:43.58 --> 00:29:51.10 So we're talking, that's the first most important thing is your devotion to the Emperor.
00:29:51.10 --> 00:29:53.94 That's the most important thing that we're talking about.
00:29:53.94 --> 00:30:02.06 The gods look upon you from above, the gods are related to the Emperor.
00:30:02.06 --> 00:30:07.86 The next section is Filiol Piety.
00:30:07.86 --> 00:30:13.26 So now we're talking about reverence of our parents, loyalty and Filiol Piety as one formed
00:30:13.26 --> 00:30:17.66 the essence of our national morality.
00:30:17.66 --> 00:30:22.18 The loyal subject is always a beautiful son.
00:30:22.18 --> 00:30:27.86 The devoured man of fast, the best traditions of our forefathers by bearing in mind the
00:30:27.86 --> 00:30:37.58 wishes of your parents thereby fulfilling the sacred duty of a loyal subject on the battlefield.
00:30:37.58 --> 00:30:41.46 Hey, respect your parents, I can get behind that.
00:30:41.46 --> 00:30:45.02 Nothing wrong with that.
00:30:45.02 --> 00:30:47.66 Trying to be a good kid, sure.
00:30:47.66 --> 00:30:50.26 No objections.
00:30:50.26 --> 00:30:57.62 The Luts and Manors, the salute is the expression of a sincere feeling of obedience.
00:30:57.62 --> 00:31:02.10 And is also a symbol of unity between those above and those below.
00:31:02.10 --> 00:31:05.54 Salutes must be strictly executed on the field.
00:31:05.54 --> 00:31:10.94 If a soldier is filled with a sense of decorum and strict in practicing good manners, it shows
00:31:10.94 --> 00:31:12.66 that he is a strong warrior.
00:31:12.66 --> 00:31:14.14 To me, this is weird.
00:31:14.14 --> 00:31:25.78 Because Salutes are a definitely a time-honored military tradition throughout the world.
00:31:25.78 --> 00:31:30.30 And in the US military, you don't salute a lot in the field for sure.
00:31:30.30 --> 00:31:31.74 In the sealed teams, you don't salute.
00:31:31.74 --> 00:31:35.06 I mean, very rarely, there's not a lot of saluting going on, basically because you're
00:31:35.06 --> 00:31:39.02 not walking around when uniform all the time.
00:31:39.02 --> 00:31:41.78 So there's not a lot of saluting going on.
00:31:41.78 --> 00:31:47.18 But yeah, so there's a lot of different ways to show respect.
00:31:47.18 --> 00:31:51.26 And saluting is sort of the most visible, I guess, why?
00:31:51.26 --> 00:31:54.42 But it's just kind of interesting to me that they're so into it.
00:31:54.42 --> 00:31:56.18 Let me put it to this way.
00:31:56.18 --> 00:32:03.42 This is, you know, when you see like a military movie, which I'm sure you've seen some,
00:32:03.42 --> 00:32:04.62 yes sir.
00:32:04.62 --> 00:32:08.82 When you see like the new guy officer, and he says, hey, you better give me a salute
00:32:08.82 --> 00:32:13.94 sergeant, right? And everyone knows that that guy's not a good leader immediately, right?
00:32:13.94 --> 00:32:16.46 Because you don't get all freaked out because someone doesn't salute you the way they
00:32:16.46 --> 00:32:17.46 should.
00:32:17.46 --> 00:32:22.50 So now we have the whole military is acting like that.
00:32:22.50 --> 00:32:25.22 The whole Japanese military is like, hey, you better salute.
00:32:25.22 --> 00:32:27.10 That to me is a little bit.
00:32:27.10 --> 00:32:29.34 And I get it, right?
00:32:29.34 --> 00:32:31.58 It's the military tradition.
00:32:31.58 --> 00:32:34.02 It is, it's not a show of obedience.
00:32:34.02 --> 00:32:35.58 As far as I'm concerned, it's a respectful thing.
00:32:35.58 --> 00:32:40.22 Like, hey, you know, there you are, you're a senior officer or whatever, boom, you crack this
00:32:40.22 --> 00:32:41.22 salute.
00:32:41.22 --> 00:32:42.22 It's all good.
00:32:42.22 --> 00:32:50.98 Isn't it like a symbol of just extreme discipline, like, no your place, like, no your
00:32:50.98 --> 00:32:53.70 role, no your place?
00:32:53.70 --> 00:32:55.50 It does, I guess, signify that.
00:32:55.50 --> 00:32:58.50 But really, it's just about respect as far as I'm concerned.
00:32:58.50 --> 00:33:03.06 Boom, you see someone that senior to you, boom, you crack a salute, all good.
00:33:03.06 --> 00:33:10.78 Right, but it's like the kind of the functional use of that respect is like, you know,
00:33:10.78 --> 00:33:14.38 I'm gonna come, I'm gonna, you know, appear before you kind of thing.
00:33:14.38 --> 00:33:18.62 And it's basically recognizing, hey, I'm being if you, you're above me, you know, this
00:33:18.62 --> 00:33:21.70 is how we're functioning together right now.
00:33:21.70 --> 00:33:24.70 Yeah, there's my, you know, a firm, what do you call it?
00:33:24.70 --> 00:33:25.70 Confucianian.
00:33:25.70 --> 00:33:26.70 Confucianian.
00:33:26.70 --> 00:33:27.70 Yeah, yeah.
00:33:27.70 --> 00:33:29.98 There is a, that's there.
00:33:29.98 --> 00:33:34.62 And it's a way, to me, it's all about tradition and respect, more than anything else.
00:33:34.62 --> 00:33:35.62 Yeah.
00:33:35.62 --> 00:33:37.10 You know, that's what it is.
00:33:37.10 --> 00:33:38.62 It's about tradition and respect.
00:33:38.62 --> 00:33:42.66 You know, you see someone that's senior, you know, an officer, if you're an
00:33:42.66 --> 00:33:45.34 enlisted guy, you salute all the officers, boom, get them up.
00:33:45.34 --> 00:33:46.70 That's the way it is.
00:33:46.70 --> 00:33:54.78 But it's, yeah, to me, it's not like this crazy thing, like I never yelled at anyone
00:33:54.78 --> 00:33:56.42 for not saluting me, right?
00:33:56.42 --> 00:33:57.42 Yeah.
00:33:57.42 --> 00:34:02.46 You know, and you probably couldn't find a lot of seals that would that have done
00:34:02.46 --> 00:34:03.46 that.
00:34:03.46 --> 00:34:08.22 Now, could you say that, oh, this, there's, you know, you could see some kid that's
00:34:08.22 --> 00:34:12.42 being legitimately trying to be disrespectful, right?
00:34:12.42 --> 00:34:14.14 Yeah.
00:34:14.14 --> 00:34:17.50 And maybe that person could get tightened up.
00:34:17.50 --> 00:34:18.50 Yeah.
00:34:18.50 --> 00:34:23.34 But, yeah, like on a few good men, remember when he's like, hey, whatever happened
00:34:23.34 --> 00:34:27.42 that's alluding it officer when he leaves the room and then the guy puts his hands in his pocket.
00:34:27.42 --> 00:34:28.42 Oh, dang.
00:34:28.42 --> 00:34:30.42 Who put their hand in the pocket?
00:34:30.42 --> 00:34:36.42 His name was, downy or dogg, dogg, dogg, dogg, and dogg, and dogg.
00:34:36.42 --> 00:34:38.58 And who is he doing that, too?
00:34:38.58 --> 00:34:39.58 Tom Cruise.
00:34:39.58 --> 00:34:41.62 Oh, dang, Tom Cruise wasn't getting the respect.
00:34:41.62 --> 00:34:42.62 Correct.
00:34:42.62 --> 00:34:43.62 There you go.
00:34:43.62 --> 00:34:44.62 Yeah.
00:34:44.62 --> 00:34:45.62 There you go.
00:34:45.62 --> 00:34:46.62 Good example.
00:34:46.62 --> 00:34:47.62 Yeah.
00:34:47.62 --> 00:34:49.66 But see what I'm saying though.
00:34:49.66 --> 00:34:53.38 It's like, but what is that respect kind of reflecting though?
00:34:53.38 --> 00:34:54.62 Overal functionally.
00:34:54.62 --> 00:34:55.62 It does seem like that.
00:34:55.62 --> 00:35:00.14 It's like, okay, knowing your place, I'm here to kind of recognize that.
00:35:00.14 --> 00:35:04.58 Just in the small detailed way that apparently will be unnecessary in certain scenarios.
00:35:04.58 --> 00:35:05.58 Yeah.
00:35:05.58 --> 00:35:08.58 And I guess, I guess what you're actually talking about, it's just good order and discipline.
00:35:08.58 --> 00:35:09.58 Yeah.
00:35:09.58 --> 00:35:10.58 Good order in this month.
00:35:10.58 --> 00:35:11.58 Yeah.
00:35:11.58 --> 00:35:12.58 Like, beginning, and it's okay to do it.
00:35:12.58 --> 00:35:13.58 We just have this tradition.
00:35:13.58 --> 00:35:14.58 This is what's happening.
00:35:14.58 --> 00:35:15.58 Yeah.
00:35:15.58 --> 00:35:18.10 Same thing with like, polish shoes or, you know, uniform.
00:35:18.10 --> 00:35:19.10 Yeah.
00:35:19.10 --> 00:35:20.10 Yeah.
00:35:20.10 --> 00:35:21.10 Yeah.
00:35:21.10 --> 00:35:22.10 Exactly right.
00:35:22.10 --> 00:35:23.10 So it's like there's no questions.
00:35:23.10 --> 00:35:24.10 There's no wiggle room or whatever.
00:35:24.10 --> 00:35:26.10 Like we're here to do the job like from eight to ten.
00:35:26.10 --> 00:35:27.10 Yeah.
00:35:27.10 --> 00:35:32.22 And I'm just saying, if you're freaking out about sluts, then you probably need to look at
00:35:32.22 --> 00:35:33.98 some other stuff that's going on around you.
00:35:33.98 --> 00:35:36.02 You might be freaking out about the wrong thing.
00:35:36.02 --> 00:35:38.02 It's all I'm saying.
00:35:38.02 --> 00:35:41.98 And if you're good, like if you're a good officer, it's not like people are trying
00:35:41.98 --> 00:35:43.62 to avoid saluting you.
00:35:43.62 --> 00:35:44.62 Yeah.
00:35:44.62 --> 00:35:45.62 They're down.
00:35:45.62 --> 00:35:47.30 They're like, you know, hey, here's the salute.
00:35:47.30 --> 00:35:48.30 Let's do it.
00:35:48.30 --> 00:35:52.30 All right, getting back to the book, the way of comrades and arms, comrades and arms,
00:35:52.30 --> 00:35:58.06 united in life and death for the imperial cause should display full mutual trust.
00:35:58.06 --> 00:36:02.82 Should always endeavor to improve each other, assist each other in distress and restrain
00:36:02.82 --> 00:36:09.94 each other against excesses in order that they may jointly fulfill their duties as soldiers.
00:36:09.94 --> 00:36:11.34 It's all solid.
00:36:11.34 --> 00:36:13.38 Hey, we're going to trust each other.
00:36:13.38 --> 00:36:16.34 We're going to work always to improve each other.
00:36:16.34 --> 00:36:18.26 We're going to help each other if we got a problem.
00:36:18.26 --> 00:36:19.74 These are all fine.
00:36:19.74 --> 00:36:22.58 All good to go.
00:36:22.58 --> 00:36:23.58 Initiative.
00:36:23.58 --> 00:36:27.18 Next section, initiative in exemplary conduct.
00:36:27.18 --> 00:36:30.22 This is interesting because we're not just talking about initiative.
00:36:30.22 --> 00:36:31.50 Because initiative is good.
00:36:31.50 --> 00:36:32.82 We want people to have initiative.
00:36:32.82 --> 00:36:35.90 But this is initiative in exemplary conduct.
00:36:35.90 --> 00:36:41.78 Leaders should be zealous in giving a worthy example in everything.
00:36:41.78 --> 00:36:47.94 If there is disorder above, those below will be unruly.
00:36:47.94 --> 00:36:49.74 Innovation is prized on the field.
00:36:49.74 --> 00:36:54.94 Leaders should provide an example by acting more courageously than others.
00:36:54.94 --> 00:36:57.50 Yeah, good.
00:36:57.50 --> 00:37:02.46 I mean, can't really argue with those.
00:37:02.46 --> 00:37:03.82 You've got to have discipline.
00:37:03.82 --> 00:37:06.10 You've got to have order.
00:37:06.10 --> 00:37:08.14 You've got to set the example.
00:37:08.14 --> 00:37:10.02 Can't argue with those.
00:37:10.02 --> 00:37:12.46 Next responsibility.
00:37:12.46 --> 00:37:16.18 Duty is sacred.
00:37:16.18 --> 00:37:23.18 Once responsibility is extremely heavy, each and every task must be performed with the
00:37:23.18 --> 00:37:29.50 utmost care until all a field available means are exhausted.
00:37:29.50 --> 00:37:39.62 Those who have a strong sense of responsibility are bravest of the brave on the field.
00:37:39.62 --> 00:37:40.62 Okay.
00:37:40.62 --> 00:37:41.62 Okay.
00:37:41.62 --> 00:37:42.86 Duty is sacred.
00:37:42.86 --> 00:37:43.86 You got you.
00:37:43.86 --> 00:37:47.30 It's a bowl.
00:37:47.30 --> 00:37:49.30 You got to be responsible.
00:37:49.30 --> 00:37:51.30 You got to take care of what you're doing.
00:37:51.30 --> 00:37:53.02 Next one, view of life and death.
00:37:53.02 --> 00:37:58.34 The lofty spirit of self-sacrificing service to the state must prevail in life and in
00:37:58.34 --> 00:37:59.34 death.
00:37:59.34 --> 00:38:03.78 Do your duty with heart and soul regardless of life or death.
00:38:03.78 --> 00:38:10.34 After exerting all your powers spiritually and physically, calmly face death rejoicing
00:38:10.34 --> 00:38:17.70 in the hope of living in the eternal cause for which you serve.
00:38:17.70 --> 00:38:23.06 You see little Kamakaze activity creeping in right there.
00:38:23.06 --> 00:38:24.06 Honor.
00:38:24.06 --> 00:38:25.06 Next section.
00:38:25.06 --> 00:38:28.34 Strong are those who have a keen sense of honor.
00:38:28.34 --> 00:38:34.26 Meet the expectations of your family and home community by making effort upon effort, always
00:38:34.26 --> 00:38:38.78 mindful of the honor of your name.
00:38:38.78 --> 00:38:44.54 If alive do not suffer the disgrace of becoming a prisoner.
00:38:44.54 --> 00:38:53.10 In death do not leave behind a name, soiled by misdeeds.
00:38:53.10 --> 00:38:54.10 No surrender.
00:38:54.10 --> 00:38:55.38 I was reading something.
00:38:55.38 --> 00:38:57.34 I forget the facts off the top of my head.
00:38:57.34 --> 00:39:05.14 But the number of the number of Japanese military that were taken prisoner was like this
00:39:05.14 --> 00:39:06.86 tiny number.
00:39:06.86 --> 00:39:11.62 It was like, I don't know, 30, 40, 50,000 something like that.
00:39:11.62 --> 00:39:17.26 I say it's a tiny number when you compare it to the amount of Germans.
00:39:17.26 --> 00:39:22.18 There was millions of Germans that were taken prisoner at one point or another.
00:39:22.18 --> 00:39:24.14 Again, don't quote beyond the number.
00:39:24.14 --> 00:39:26.10 But the disparity is huge.
00:39:26.10 --> 00:39:32.62 This is why they were not going to be taken prisoner.
00:39:32.62 --> 00:39:35.06 Next simplicity and fortitude.
00:39:35.06 --> 00:39:38.50 Hey, law of combat, keep things simple.
00:39:38.50 --> 00:39:40.10 Fortitude, yes, you got to have fortitude.
00:39:40.10 --> 00:39:41.10 Here we go.
00:39:41.10 --> 00:39:44.18 Let simplicity guide your daily life on the battlefield.
00:39:44.18 --> 00:39:49.54 Promote habits of fortitude and the high morale.
00:39:49.54 --> 00:39:51.26 Can't argue with that.
00:39:51.26 --> 00:39:52.90 Life on the field must be plain.
00:39:52.90 --> 00:39:57.66 Consider privation your daily lot and endeavor to be thrifty.
00:39:57.66 --> 00:39:58.66 Luxury Saps Valor.
00:39:58.66 --> 00:40:00.98 Oh, I like that.
00:40:00.98 --> 00:40:02.98 There you go.
00:40:02.98 --> 00:40:04.70 Luxury Saps Valor.
00:40:04.70 --> 00:40:08.58 The Ovalon, are you listening?
00:40:08.58 --> 00:40:09.58 Luxury.
00:40:09.58 --> 00:40:11.66 Can't have those luxury days too often.
00:40:11.66 --> 00:40:15.26 This is this idea of simplicity, of course, important.
00:40:15.26 --> 00:40:22.06 And even, you know, I talk about simplicity from a, you know, from a, from a communications
00:40:22.06 --> 00:40:24.78 viewpoint and from a planning viewpoint.
00:40:24.78 --> 00:40:28.94 But in life, simplicity is a very positive thing.
00:40:28.94 --> 00:40:32.78 You know, you got the modern day minimalist movement.
00:40:32.78 --> 00:40:33.94 Are you familiar with that?
00:40:33.94 --> 00:40:34.66 Yes.
00:40:34.66 --> 00:40:35.66 Or you don't own anything.
00:40:35.66 --> 00:40:38.18 Or as little as you can.
00:40:38.18 --> 00:40:39.18 Yeah.
00:40:39.18 --> 00:40:47.58 Though the cool, one of the coolest things about going on deployment in the dams,
00:40:47.58 --> 00:40:48.98 perking their dirty.
00:40:48.98 --> 00:40:54.42 One of the coolest things about it is you, everyone's a minimalist.
00:40:54.42 --> 00:40:56.38 It's just, you go on deployment.
00:40:56.38 --> 00:41:00.78 You have, like, whatever, five bags.
00:41:00.78 --> 00:41:06.86 In the bags, you have three, you know, three pairs of pants, two pairs of boots, four
00:41:06.86 --> 00:41:08.78 t-shirts.
00:41:08.78 --> 00:41:11.62 Got your weapon, got your body armor.
00:41:11.62 --> 00:41:14.38 You're, like, you're, it's so awesome.
00:41:14.38 --> 00:41:21.10 And it feels really good when you're able to get away from all that stuff that you got
00:41:21.10 --> 00:41:25.78 piling up back in your big house with the big closets.
00:41:25.78 --> 00:41:27.42 You got all that stuff in there.
00:41:27.42 --> 00:41:30.14 And all that stuff weighs down on you.
00:41:30.14 --> 00:41:34.86 And when you get to, you know, Tony, BTF, Tony, we're used to joke about you and you
00:41:34.86 --> 00:41:38.86 got like, you know, you got problems going on, you know, at home and everyone's just like
00:41:38.86 --> 00:41:44.26 bothering you and you just like, get on a, you just get on a C13 ball.
00:41:44.26 --> 00:41:48.46 Everything's fine.
00:41:48.46 --> 00:41:50.02 And I agree with that.
00:41:50.02 --> 00:41:52.30 You would get that feeling of everything's fine.
00:41:52.30 --> 00:41:53.66 Your guess, hey, there's nothing.
00:41:53.66 --> 00:41:55.90 We're all you have to worry about as the bad guys.
00:41:55.90 --> 00:41:56.90 Right?
00:41:56.90 --> 00:41:57.90 It's very easy.
00:41:57.90 --> 00:41:58.90 It's very focused.
00:41:58.90 --> 00:41:59.90 It's just stuff going on.
00:41:59.90 --> 00:42:02.58 And you don't have all this other literal stuff.
00:42:02.58 --> 00:42:04.66 You just got what you need.
00:42:04.66 --> 00:42:08.50 You don't bring, if you don't bring it, if you don't need it, you don't bring it.
00:42:08.50 --> 00:42:10.82 Because you don't want this other stuff.
00:42:10.82 --> 00:42:11.82 Right?
00:42:11.82 --> 00:42:13.62 So you, you keep it.
00:42:13.62 --> 00:42:14.62 Keep it simple.
00:42:14.62 --> 00:42:16.26 It's what you keep it.
00:42:16.26 --> 00:42:19.18 And that's what they're saying here.
00:42:19.18 --> 00:42:25.54 And, you know, of course, I doubt, I doubt that the Emperor was living, you know, a simple
00:42:25.54 --> 00:42:28.38 life of privation in the palace.
00:42:28.38 --> 00:42:29.38 Right?
00:42:29.38 --> 00:42:33.82 But if we can convince all the people, if we can convince everyone that they should just
00:42:33.82 --> 00:42:38.78 be living like in the dirt, cool, more from me.
00:42:38.78 --> 00:42:40.86 So there's a little bit of that going on.
00:42:40.86 --> 00:42:44.94 Trying to keep the people with the positive mindset, even though they don't have anything.
00:42:44.94 --> 00:42:47.78 Telling them that you don't want anything because it's going to sap your valor.
00:42:47.78 --> 00:42:49.74 You want to live it lean.
00:42:49.74 --> 00:42:50.74 Right?
00:42:50.74 --> 00:42:54.34 Luxury, sap's valor.
00:42:54.34 --> 00:42:59.10 Ooh, true statement though, true statement.
00:42:59.10 --> 00:43:01.14 What happens to rock and roll bands?
00:43:01.14 --> 00:43:03.90 They're a valor gets saped.
00:43:03.90 --> 00:43:04.90 No.
00:43:04.90 --> 00:43:07.30 They come out with a good album.
00:43:07.30 --> 00:43:08.30 Right?
00:43:08.30 --> 00:43:09.30 Good hard album.
00:43:09.30 --> 00:43:14.14 They ever go, yes, that's a kick ass album.
00:43:14.14 --> 00:43:17.46 And then the next thing, you know, they're living a life of luxury in their music gets
00:43:17.46 --> 00:43:18.86 soft and weak.
00:43:18.86 --> 00:43:19.86 Yeah.
00:43:19.86 --> 00:43:23.86 Maybe it's sap's their valor.
00:43:23.86 --> 00:43:25.70 They're grit.
00:43:25.70 --> 00:43:27.06 Next up, integrity.
00:43:27.06 --> 00:43:30.70 Integrity is the foundation of the spirit of the warrior.
00:43:30.70 --> 00:43:36.98 How can a man who cannot conquer his worldly desires devote his life to the country?
00:43:36.98 --> 00:43:44.02 Be austere in your daily behavior, deal with matters justly so that you will not be ashamed
00:43:44.02 --> 00:43:48.86 of your conduct in the sight of God or man.
00:43:48.86 --> 00:43:51.78 Hey, cool.
00:43:51.78 --> 00:43:52.78 Right?
00:43:52.78 --> 00:43:55.26 You know, keep control over your desires.
00:43:55.26 --> 00:43:56.26 God it.
00:43:56.26 --> 00:43:59.26 Let that sounds like a good idea.
00:43:59.26 --> 00:44:02.86 You know, act in such a way that you're that people, you know, this is going to go
00:44:02.86 --> 00:44:07.34 back to the, hey, imagine you're being at someone's video and you at all times.
00:44:07.34 --> 00:44:11.58 And then how do you really want to act the way if everyone was watching you all the
00:44:11.58 --> 00:44:12.58 time?
00:44:12.58 --> 00:44:13.58 How would you act?
00:44:13.58 --> 00:44:18.78 You want to make the right decisions that you can stand up before other man or God
00:44:18.78 --> 00:44:22.14 and be like, yep, my actions were fine.
00:44:22.14 --> 00:44:26.70 So that's what that's what this is saying.
00:44:26.70 --> 00:44:28.14 Can we argue against that?
00:44:28.14 --> 00:44:32.66 Not really what was interesting is you read some of those Kamakaze letters.
00:44:32.66 --> 00:44:40.14 A lot of them specifically say there was no, I have no, I have no woman in my life.
00:44:40.14 --> 00:44:42.90 They specifically say that.
00:44:42.90 --> 00:44:44.30 Like I've read a bunch of those letters.
00:44:44.30 --> 00:44:46.18 I don't know how many, but a lot.
00:44:46.18 --> 00:44:51.42 And there's a decent percentage, I don't know, maybe 10 percent, which is a lot when you think
00:44:51.42 --> 00:44:54.86 about it, but a lot of the letters and who knows on the actual percentage.
00:44:54.86 --> 00:45:00.90 But if you read some of those letters, you'll see these young 18, 19, 20 years old,
00:45:00.90 --> 00:45:05.30 bragging to their parents, I have no female in my life.
00:45:05.30 --> 00:45:07.02 Oh, they say that I'm positive.
00:45:07.02 --> 00:45:11.78 They say, they're positive possible way that I have no, they'll say, you know, I have
00:45:11.78 --> 00:45:14.42 no need for money or women.
00:45:14.42 --> 00:45:15.66 They say these things.
00:45:15.66 --> 00:45:21.02 So they're actually telling their parents like, I all I have is you, right?
00:45:21.02 --> 00:45:27.78 They're more looking to honor their parents than they are looking to have a girlfriend,
00:45:27.78 --> 00:45:32.78 which to me is is really jacked up.
00:45:32.78 --> 00:45:37.78 You know, when you're 18 years old, you have a girlfriend.
00:45:37.78 --> 00:45:38.78 Sure.
00:45:38.78 --> 00:45:39.78 Am I wrong?
00:45:39.78 --> 00:45:42.46 I, you know, I'm teach their own, I guess.
00:45:42.46 --> 00:45:45.10 Bra, come on, you're 18 years old.
00:45:45.10 --> 00:45:47.66 An 18 year old needs a girlfriend.
00:45:47.66 --> 00:45:51.86 Yeah, no, not if he's like committed to the cause.
00:45:51.86 --> 00:45:57.10 You know, I always felt that like, especially at 18, if you're committed to like, I don't
00:45:57.10 --> 00:46:00.62 know, if it, well, again, to each their own, for sure.
00:46:00.62 --> 00:46:07.94 But it is not uncommon for an 18 year old dedicated to a, what's the cause to cause?
00:46:07.94 --> 00:46:08.94 I don't know.
00:46:08.94 --> 00:46:09.94 Whatever.
00:46:09.94 --> 00:46:11.98 In whatever situation to get, to get.
00:46:11.98 --> 00:46:13.94 And because they got some.
00:46:13.94 --> 00:46:14.94 No, that's true.
00:46:14.94 --> 00:46:17.62 I'm not saying the girlfriends won't jam you up.
00:46:17.62 --> 00:46:18.62 Yeah, they will.
00:46:18.62 --> 00:46:22.38 So especially when you're 17, 16, 18, 14, 13.
00:46:22.38 --> 00:46:23.38 It's 20, 24.
00:46:23.38 --> 00:46:26.66 Yeah, it even's out at about 30.
00:46:26.66 --> 00:46:27.66 It's 30.
00:46:27.66 --> 00:46:28.66 Yeah, it's where you get a grip.
00:46:28.66 --> 00:46:29.66 Yeah, it's where you get a grip.
00:46:29.66 --> 00:46:32.62 Well, probably because of yourself to be honest with you, but 100%.
00:46:32.62 --> 00:46:34.66 Yeah, it's not the grip.
00:46:34.66 --> 00:46:35.66 Yeah, it's you.
00:46:35.66 --> 00:46:41.50 But yes, so they, you know, like, I don't know, 18, what do you do at 18?
00:46:41.50 --> 00:46:42.50 Military, I would imagine.
00:46:42.50 --> 00:46:43.50 I know it football.
00:46:43.50 --> 00:46:44.50 It was like that.
00:46:44.50 --> 00:46:45.50 The girlfriend.
00:46:45.50 --> 00:46:47.50 You know, it's like kidding in the middle.
00:46:47.50 --> 00:46:49.58 No girls whatsoever.
00:46:49.58 --> 00:46:50.98 Are you talking like, yeah, oh, yeah.
00:46:50.98 --> 00:46:52.58 Just an inch from girls.
00:46:52.58 --> 00:46:55.14 I'm not saying actual accidents is the next level.
00:46:55.14 --> 00:46:56.14 Echoed.
00:46:56.14 --> 00:47:02.34 No, but I am saying if you're trying to demonstrate or illustrate the your loyalty
00:47:02.34 --> 00:47:05.26 to parents, the cause, whatever.
00:47:05.26 --> 00:47:06.70 Yes, you say like, proud.
00:47:06.70 --> 00:47:12.82 I don't even girls don't even like, you know, waiver my dedication to the cause.
00:47:12.82 --> 00:47:13.82 You know, okay.
00:47:13.82 --> 00:47:14.82 I get that.
00:47:14.82 --> 00:47:15.82 I get that.
00:47:15.82 --> 00:47:16.82 That's what this is saying.
00:47:16.82 --> 00:47:28.94 I don't think I necessarily agree with the 1918, 20 year old male human having no female interaction.
00:47:28.94 --> 00:47:29.94 Yeah.
00:47:29.94 --> 00:47:34.54 To me, that just sounds like not the best idea.
00:47:34.54 --> 00:47:36.90 Well, let's put it this way.
00:47:36.90 --> 00:47:39.86 I agree with you.
00:47:39.86 --> 00:47:44.90 But I agree with this because I feel like that's just what they're saying.
00:47:44.90 --> 00:47:46.42 No, it's definitely no.
00:47:46.42 --> 00:47:47.42 I agree with you.
00:47:47.42 --> 00:47:48.42 I agree with you.
00:47:48.42 --> 00:47:49.42 Yeah, I agree with you.
00:47:49.42 --> 00:47:54.90 It's, and I think what hit me weird was the, the Kamakaze violence that are just
00:47:54.90 --> 00:47:57.06 like so happy that they don't have a girlfriend.
00:47:57.06 --> 00:48:00.06 I'm thinking, are you really that happy that you don't have a girlfriend?
00:48:00.06 --> 00:48:04.42 And if you are that happy that you don't have a girlfriend, they kept you in lockdown.
00:48:04.42 --> 00:48:05.42 Right?
00:48:05.42 --> 00:48:07.34 They kept you in a serious lockdown.
00:48:07.34 --> 00:48:08.34 Yes.
00:48:08.34 --> 00:48:15.22 Because do you remember, I mean, when you're a boy, when you're 10 years old, when you're 11
00:48:15.22 --> 00:48:19.18 years old, 12 years old, like you're already looking at girls like, oh, I want to hang
00:48:19.18 --> 00:48:21.82 out with that thing right over there.
00:48:21.82 --> 00:48:24.62 That girl, I want to go like talk to that, right?
00:48:24.62 --> 00:48:25.62 Talk to that thing.
00:48:25.62 --> 00:48:26.62 Yeah.
00:48:26.62 --> 00:48:27.62 You know what I'm saying?
00:48:27.62 --> 00:48:28.62 Like it's an instinct.
00:48:28.62 --> 00:48:29.62 Yes.
00:48:29.62 --> 00:48:33.74 That is fully there as a, as a dude.
00:48:33.74 --> 00:48:34.74 Right.
00:48:34.74 --> 00:48:39.90 But at that most cases, at that point, I would argue that in most cases, you're not consciously
00:48:39.90 --> 00:48:44.70 thinking of a meaningful productive relationship necessarily.
00:48:44.70 --> 00:48:49.58 You just have a sort of a feeling in a sort of like attraction or draw towards this thing.
00:48:49.58 --> 00:48:53.26 And that attraction and draw towards this thing.
00:48:53.26 --> 00:48:54.26 Yeah.
00:48:54.26 --> 00:48:56.94 We'll get in the way or at the very least come here.
00:48:56.94 --> 00:48:57.94 You're right.
00:48:57.94 --> 00:48:58.94 I get you.
00:48:58.94 --> 00:48:59.94 I'm saying, I hear you.
00:48:59.94 --> 00:49:00.94 Yes, you gotta be.
00:49:00.94 --> 00:49:05.30 And definitely, if you're 17 years old, you gotta be careful that girls don't pull
00:49:05.30 --> 00:49:06.78 you off track.
00:49:06.78 --> 00:49:08.06 Yeah.
00:49:08.06 --> 00:49:09.90 And by the way, I'm saying this in one direction.
00:49:09.90 --> 00:49:11.26 Same thing opposite direction.
00:49:11.26 --> 00:49:12.74 I guess I should've said that.
00:49:12.74 --> 00:49:13.74 But wouldn't you know?
00:49:13.74 --> 00:49:17.18 Girls will get pulled off track by boys.
00:49:17.18 --> 00:49:18.18 Oh, yes.
00:49:18.18 --> 00:49:22.70 So I guess what we're talking about is getting the relationship going.
00:49:22.70 --> 00:49:23.70 Yeah.
00:49:23.70 --> 00:49:24.70 Okay.
00:49:24.70 --> 00:49:26.62 I agree with you.
00:49:26.62 --> 00:49:31.26 If you are fully committed to the cause, one thing that could fall away from your commitment
00:49:31.26 --> 00:49:33.82 would be, look, I'm not even, I don't care about girls.
00:49:33.82 --> 00:49:34.82 That's where I'm at.
00:49:34.82 --> 00:49:35.82 Okay.
00:49:35.82 --> 00:49:36.82 I get you.
00:49:36.82 --> 00:49:37.82 I'll give it to you.
00:49:37.82 --> 00:49:39.42 Actually, you kind of have to because you were like that.
00:49:39.42 --> 00:49:43.62 Even when you said when you were overseas, you didn't like, you know, you didn't want
00:49:43.62 --> 00:49:46.10 to think about your family, you don't want to do it.
00:49:46.10 --> 00:49:51.46 So what would have even made it better technically in this specific way is to not even
00:49:51.46 --> 00:49:54.66 have a family, not even have a girlfriend, not even have a wife to admit.
00:49:54.66 --> 00:49:55.66 Exactly.
00:49:55.66 --> 00:49:56.66 Right.
00:49:56.66 --> 00:49:57.66 So yeah.
00:49:57.66 --> 00:49:58.66 So that's what they're going to say, you know?
00:49:58.66 --> 00:49:59.66 Yeah.
00:49:59.66 --> 00:50:00.66 No, that's the ultimate commitment.
00:50:00.66 --> 00:50:02.70 You are correct.
00:50:02.70 --> 00:50:05.26 I don't agree with it, though.
00:50:05.26 --> 00:50:08.14 Well, ironically, I don't agree with it.
00:50:08.14 --> 00:50:09.14 Yeah.
00:50:09.14 --> 00:50:11.14 You're just, well, you see their point.
00:50:11.14 --> 00:50:12.14 Yes, sir.
00:50:12.14 --> 00:50:14.58 And that's why I kind of lived that way when I was overseas.
00:50:14.58 --> 00:50:16.98 Hey, I don't want to look at pictures of my wife and kids while I'm here.
00:50:16.98 --> 00:50:19.06 I want to focus on the mission at hand.
00:50:19.06 --> 00:50:23.54 But that's a lot different than coming home and saying, oh, I don't want to have any
00:50:23.54 --> 00:50:24.86 female in my life.
00:50:24.86 --> 00:50:25.86 Yeah.
00:50:25.86 --> 00:50:26.86 It's a lot different.
00:50:26.86 --> 00:50:27.86 Yeah.
00:50:27.86 --> 00:50:30.58 Or if you're a female, saying, look, I don't want to be focused on.
00:50:30.58 --> 00:50:33.90 I guess I guess that happens, you know, on the other way, too.
00:50:33.90 --> 00:50:34.90 Yeah, fully.
00:50:34.90 --> 00:50:37.22 You know, a female that's committed to her career.
00:50:37.22 --> 00:50:38.54 So she doesn't want to have kids.
00:50:38.54 --> 00:50:41.74 She doesn't want to get married because she's focused on the career.
00:50:41.74 --> 00:50:42.74 Yeah.
00:50:42.74 --> 00:50:43.74 Yeah.
00:50:43.74 --> 00:50:48.06 Which is actually cool, but it is an extreme way to get down.
00:50:48.06 --> 00:50:49.06 All right.
00:50:49.06 --> 00:50:54.90 Well, I don't believe there's any conduct that you need to be ashamed of if you have
00:50:54.90 --> 00:50:55.90 a girlfriend.
00:50:55.90 --> 00:50:56.90 It's what I'm saying.
00:50:56.90 --> 00:50:58.90 There you go.
00:50:58.90 --> 00:51:01.18 All right.
00:51:01.18 --> 00:51:06.26 Chapter three, Council Concerning Field Service.
00:51:06.26 --> 00:51:12.94 Moments negligence may result in an unexpected catastrophe, be constantly on your guard,
00:51:12.94 --> 00:51:16.78 do not despise your enemy or the natives.
00:51:16.78 --> 00:51:19.14 Do not be negligent after a small success.
00:51:19.14 --> 00:51:20.14 Okay.
00:51:20.14 --> 00:51:21.14 Let's just go through this.
00:51:21.14 --> 00:51:22.14 Okay.
00:51:22.14 --> 00:51:25.98 So a moment's negligence may result in an unexpected catastrophe.
00:51:25.98 --> 00:51:27.38 That's a great point.
00:51:27.38 --> 00:51:29.18 Pay attention.
00:51:29.18 --> 00:51:30.82 Be constantly on your guard.
00:51:30.82 --> 00:51:31.82 Great point.
00:51:31.82 --> 00:51:33.54 Pay attention.
00:51:33.54 --> 00:51:37.46 Do not despise your enemy or the natives.
00:51:37.46 --> 00:51:38.46 Great point.
00:51:38.46 --> 00:51:39.46 Right.
00:51:39.46 --> 00:51:44.50 We're going to go fight with honor and we're not going to abuse the natives.
00:51:44.50 --> 00:51:47.66 Do not be negligent after a small success.
00:51:47.66 --> 00:51:48.90 Great point.
00:51:48.90 --> 00:51:53.46 That's when you're going to get arrogant and your ego gets out of control and you get caught.
00:51:53.46 --> 00:51:58.46 Know that carelessness brings disaster.
00:51:58.46 --> 00:52:01.22 Great point.
00:52:01.22 --> 00:52:02.22 So there you go.
00:52:02.22 --> 00:52:03.22 That's just opening up.
00:52:03.22 --> 00:52:05.74 That's how we roll.
00:52:05.74 --> 00:52:10.98 I wonder if this document was written like as a reaction to NAN King.
00:52:10.98 --> 00:52:13.14 I wonder if they said, look, we let that happen.
00:52:13.14 --> 00:52:14.14 We got to tighten up.
00:52:14.14 --> 00:52:15.30 I wonder if they actually did that.
00:52:15.30 --> 00:52:17.30 The US military does that kind of thing.
00:52:17.30 --> 00:52:20.62 Something will go, hey, the prisoner abuse happened in Obegrabe.
00:52:20.62 --> 00:52:23.66 They made all kinds of rules and regulations about what you do with prisoners after that.
00:52:23.66 --> 00:52:25.54 I wonder if this is the same kind of thing.
00:52:25.54 --> 00:52:29.34 They tried to tighten them up.
00:52:29.34 --> 00:52:34.14 The entry duty is important upon the century rest the safety of an army.
00:52:34.14 --> 00:52:37.22 He also represents the discipline of an army.
00:52:37.22 --> 00:52:41.54 Those on sentry duty must devote their entire person to the task which must be sternly
00:52:41.54 --> 00:52:43.34 carried out.
00:52:43.34 --> 00:52:45.90 A cordva century high respect.
00:52:45.90 --> 00:52:46.90 Cool.
00:52:46.90 --> 00:52:49.10 Got to be on guard.
00:52:49.10 --> 00:52:55.06 Next ideological warfare is an important phase in modern conflict.
00:52:55.06 --> 00:52:59.18 Destroy propaganda and fabrications of the enemy.
00:52:59.18 --> 00:53:06.10 Why you're unshakable faith in the cause for which the Empire stands and endeavor to spread
00:53:06.10 --> 00:53:07.74 Kodo.
00:53:07.74 --> 00:53:09.94 Which again, that's the spirit of the Empire.
00:53:09.94 --> 00:53:15.26 So they're telling you to watch out for the enemy propaganda and how you overcome it
00:53:15.26 --> 00:53:20.14 is by having unshakable faith.
00:53:20.14 --> 00:53:23.66 Next up, rumors arise from a lack of confidence.
00:53:23.66 --> 00:53:25.30 Do not be misled.
00:53:25.30 --> 00:53:27.30 Do not be agitated by them.
00:53:27.30 --> 00:53:34.70 Normally believe in the strength of the imperial army and deeply trust your superiors.
00:53:34.70 --> 00:53:35.70 Deeply trust your superiors.
00:53:35.70 --> 00:53:38.18 There's no b-wise on the end of that.
00:53:38.18 --> 00:53:42.74 Like the American manual said, trust your superiors but b-wise.
00:53:42.74 --> 00:53:47.10 Also rumors arise from a lack of confidence.
00:53:47.10 --> 00:53:48.34 I disagree with that.
00:53:48.34 --> 00:53:54.18 I think rumors arise from lack of knowledge and lack of hearing the truth.
00:53:54.18 --> 00:53:59.18 That's the way you overcome rumors.
00:53:59.18 --> 00:54:01.18 That's how you stop rumors.
00:54:01.18 --> 00:54:05.46 Number 6, be mindful to protect the enemy property and resources.
00:54:05.46 --> 00:54:09.70 Requisitions, seizures and destruction of goods and similar actions must be executed and
00:54:09.70 --> 00:54:14.58 keeping with the regulations and always under the orders of your commanding officer.
00:54:14.58 --> 00:54:15.58 This is incredible.
00:54:15.58 --> 00:54:20.30 They're literally saying, hey, you know, when you defeat someone, you've got enemy property.
00:54:20.30 --> 00:54:22.70 You need to treat it well.
00:54:22.70 --> 00:54:23.70 You can't see it.
00:54:23.70 --> 00:54:24.70 You can't destroy it.
00:54:24.70 --> 00:54:25.70 There you go.
00:54:25.70 --> 00:54:27.70 This is like guidance.
00:54:27.70 --> 00:54:36.58 7, be gentle and protect innocent inhabitants in the spirit of benevolence and accordance
00:54:36.58 --> 00:54:41.74 with the true ideal of the imperial army.
00:54:41.74 --> 00:54:46.98 Like I said, maybe this is a reaction to what happened to Nan King because there was no
00:54:46.98 --> 00:54:53.98 being gentle and no protecting the innocent there.
00:54:53.98 --> 00:54:54.98 Those are on the field.
00:54:54.98 --> 00:55:01.30 Must not indulge in wine and women or allow desire to be clouded their consciences.
00:55:01.30 --> 00:55:07.22 They're by damaging the prestige of the imperial army and causing the dissipation of a body
00:55:07.22 --> 00:55:09.38 dedicated to service.
00:55:09.38 --> 00:55:12.74 So that one is written for echo trials.
00:55:12.74 --> 00:55:13.74 No wine, no women.
00:55:13.74 --> 00:55:16.10 Those are just going to just going to jam you up.
00:55:16.10 --> 00:55:19.62 They will concur.
00:55:19.62 --> 00:55:24.46 Okay.
00:55:24.46 --> 00:55:32.90 They should exercise self-control less than they per smurch the pure character of warriors.
00:55:32.90 --> 00:55:33.90 9.
00:55:33.90 --> 00:55:37.26 Control your anger, good to go, and suppress your grudges.
00:55:37.26 --> 00:55:39.98 The ancient said consider anger your enemy.
00:55:39.98 --> 00:55:44.26 A moment of violence often leaves cause for a long regret.
00:55:44.26 --> 00:55:47.02 It's great advice.
00:55:47.02 --> 00:55:49.38 Control your anger, control your emotions.
00:55:49.38 --> 00:55:53.38 The severity of military laws designed especially to uphold the good name of soldiers and
00:55:53.38 --> 00:55:55.78 the preserve the dignity of the imperial army.
00:55:55.78 --> 00:56:00.10 Always remember the oath that you made and the deep emotion that you felt when you left
00:56:00.10 --> 00:56:01.82 home.
00:56:01.82 --> 00:56:07.38 Call to mind how your parents, your wife and your children think of you and avoid exposing
00:56:07.38 --> 00:56:10.90 yourself to crime.
00:56:10.90 --> 00:56:19.22 Your guidance to achievements of soldiers in service foster the tradition of respecting
00:56:19.22 --> 00:56:24.86 martial attainments, cultivate and train the warriors of virtues and arts.
00:56:24.86 --> 00:56:34.62 Remember that do not allow yourself to become bored is the saying of an ancient general.
00:56:34.62 --> 00:56:38.54 So hey, look, we're telling people to train.
00:56:38.54 --> 00:56:41.50 When warrior arts train the virtues of the warriors.
00:56:41.50 --> 00:56:45.38 This is all good stuff.
00:56:45.38 --> 00:56:49.06 And remember that to don't allow yourself to become bored.
00:56:49.06 --> 00:56:50.62 When's the last time you were bored?
00:56:50.62 --> 00:56:53.10 I'm not really long time.
00:56:53.10 --> 00:56:57.42 Yeah, I'm not really one getting bored over here on my side either.
00:56:57.42 --> 00:57:01.50 Next do not allow yourself to worry about the fate of those at home in the event of your
00:57:01.50 --> 00:57:05.30 death but devote yourself wholly to service.
00:57:05.30 --> 00:57:10.06 Be always ready to meet death without regret by settling your affairs beforehand.
00:57:10.06 --> 00:57:15.78 A soldier is always prepared to expose his corpse on the battlefield.
00:57:15.78 --> 00:57:22.18 Let his family know that at times even his ashes may not reach them.
00:57:22.18 --> 00:57:28.42 So there's again there's some Kamikaze attitude sneaking in there that you may have to
00:57:28.42 --> 00:57:30.06 lay it all down.
00:57:30.06 --> 00:57:37.50 Next there is nothing more to be regretted than to fall victim to a disease on the field.
00:57:37.50 --> 00:57:44.54 Be particularly mindful of your health so that you may not be unable to serve because of
00:57:44.54 --> 00:57:45.54 excesses.
00:57:45.54 --> 00:57:47.82 So you gotta keep track of your health.
00:57:47.82 --> 00:57:51.46 Don't get sick.
00:57:51.46 --> 00:57:54.42 Late to heart the saying of an ancient warrior.
00:57:54.42 --> 00:57:57.94 My sword is my soul, my horse is my fortune.
00:57:57.94 --> 00:58:02.50 Always take care of your arms and supplies and give humane attention to animals on the
00:58:02.50 --> 00:58:04.50 field.
00:58:04.50 --> 00:58:07.38 Solid.
00:58:07.38 --> 00:58:09.54 Take care of your gear and your gear to take care of you.
00:58:09.54 --> 00:58:11.54 Have you heard that before?
00:58:11.54 --> 00:58:12.54 Yes, for me.
00:58:12.54 --> 00:58:13.54 Okay.
00:58:13.54 --> 00:58:14.54 That's a good one.
00:58:14.54 --> 00:58:15.54 Yes, seems good.
00:58:15.54 --> 00:58:17.02 It's a true one.
00:58:17.02 --> 00:58:18.02 Seems true.
00:58:18.02 --> 00:58:19.02 Yeah.
00:58:19.02 --> 00:58:24.78 Virtue in the battle zone is the source of strength in combat.
00:58:24.78 --> 00:58:31.10 Please consider the interests of other units and do not monopolize billets and materials.
00:58:31.10 --> 00:58:35.66 Remember the saying a bird taking flight does not muddy the water.
00:58:35.66 --> 00:58:43.14 Let the good reputation of the valorous impure army long remain the cause of fond recollections
00:58:43.14 --> 00:58:44.70 in an alien land.
00:58:44.70 --> 00:58:46.42 So there you go.
00:58:46.42 --> 00:58:54.14 They're telling everyone to have be virtuous in the combat zone.
00:58:54.14 --> 00:58:57.14 Bird in flight does not muddy the water.
00:58:57.14 --> 00:59:00.98 I think it just means as you elevate.
00:59:00.98 --> 00:59:04.26 Then you're not, you know, you don't need to get mad because it's not mudding the water.
00:59:04.26 --> 00:59:05.26 It's good.
00:59:05.26 --> 00:59:06.26 You're moving forward.
00:59:06.26 --> 00:59:07.26 Yeah.
00:59:07.26 --> 00:59:08.26 Could be wrong.
00:59:08.26 --> 00:59:10.26 Very obscure.
00:59:10.26 --> 00:59:13.94 A bird taking flight does not muddy the water.
00:59:13.94 --> 00:59:21.78 Let the good reputation of the valorous impure army long remain the cause of fond recollections
00:59:21.78 --> 00:59:22.78 in an alien in the land.
00:59:22.78 --> 00:59:23.78 Yeah.
00:59:23.78 --> 00:59:25.78 I mean, like, hey, this is where elevated.
00:59:25.78 --> 00:59:27.38 We're, hey, we're in this land.
00:59:27.38 --> 00:59:28.38 We're here.
00:59:28.38 --> 00:59:29.38 We invaded.
00:59:29.38 --> 00:59:30.86 But we're not going to muddy the water.
00:59:30.86 --> 00:59:35.38 We're, we're in flight.
00:59:35.38 --> 00:59:41.22 Next, you're not boast of one of one's achievements, but give others credit.
00:59:41.22 --> 00:59:46.10 But to give others credit is one of the most respected traditions among warriors.
00:59:46.10 --> 00:59:50.66 This is straight out of extreme ownership, straight out of the dichotomy of leadership.
00:59:50.66 --> 00:59:54.10 No, you don't, you don't boast of achievements.
00:59:54.10 --> 00:59:55.70 You give your credit to your team.
00:59:55.70 --> 01:00:00.86 Do not begrudge others their promotion or cherish resentment because your services are
01:00:00.86 --> 01:00:01.86 not recognized.
01:00:01.86 --> 01:00:03.98 But instead reflect upon your own shortcomings.
01:00:03.98 --> 01:00:06.66 This is, this is solid.
01:00:06.66 --> 01:00:08.66 That's solid advice, right?
01:00:08.66 --> 01:00:09.66 Oh, you got promoted.
01:00:09.66 --> 01:00:10.66 I didn't.
01:00:10.66 --> 01:00:12.66 I'm just going to hit mad at you.
01:00:12.66 --> 01:00:13.66 No.
01:00:13.66 --> 01:00:16.50 And said, I should look at myself and say, okay, what did that go do that I didn't do?
01:00:16.50 --> 01:00:17.50 What could I do better?
01:00:17.50 --> 01:00:18.50 What are my shortcomings?
01:00:18.50 --> 01:00:19.50 Yeah.
01:00:19.50 --> 01:00:27.10 Next, be honest, always consider exaggerations and lies dishonorable.
01:00:27.10 --> 01:00:28.10 Cool.
01:00:28.10 --> 01:00:30.74 Where we're 100% on board with that.
01:00:30.74 --> 01:00:34.54 Always bear yourself as a member of a great nation, trading the path of righteousness
01:00:34.54 --> 01:00:40.06 and seeking justice so that you may enhance the prestige of the empire.
01:00:40.06 --> 01:00:42.06 Totally positive.
01:00:42.06 --> 01:00:47.90 They, the seal teams for a little while, they were trying to, it was something along
01:00:47.90 --> 01:00:54.50 the lines of, I will not dishonor my team, my unit, my navy or my nation.
01:00:54.50 --> 01:00:57.58 This is the same exact thing they've got written right there.
01:00:57.58 --> 01:01:01.90 You know, you want to, you want to make the empire look good.
01:01:01.90 --> 01:01:09.22 You want to damage the reputation.
01:01:09.22 --> 01:01:12.54 Next.
01:01:12.54 --> 01:01:20.02 So do not show a lack of consideration for international currencies.
01:01:20.02 --> 01:01:21.02 Think about that.
01:01:21.02 --> 01:01:22.02 Yeah.
01:01:22.02 --> 01:01:25.98 Hey, when you go to another country, hey, don't, don't, you know, take in consideration
01:01:25.98 --> 01:01:27.98 there, their customs and currencies.
01:01:27.98 --> 01:01:32.70 That's a good thing to do.
01:01:32.70 --> 01:01:36.78 And the last one from this section, should you receive the order to return home alive after
01:01:36.78 --> 01:01:43.50 braving 10,000 deaths, think of those brave souls who will not return, be determined to
01:01:43.50 --> 01:01:50.26 become an example to the people by being careful in word and deed, renewing your vows
01:01:50.26 --> 01:01:52.22 to serve the country.
01:01:52.22 --> 01:01:57.74 It's nothing wrong with that.
01:01:57.74 --> 01:02:01.90 And then this is how this thing ends.
01:02:01.90 --> 01:02:03.62 The conclusion.
01:02:03.62 --> 01:02:13.06 The conclusion is above all the above originate from an end in the imperial rescript.
01:02:13.06 --> 01:02:19.62 Let them serve as a guide in putting into practice this battlefield morality so that all
01:02:19.62 --> 01:02:23.46 may be perfect in obeying the imperial commands.
01:02:23.46 --> 01:02:30.98 Soldiers and officers on the field lay heart, lay to heart the import of the above by
01:02:30.98 --> 01:02:37.22 fully realizing the significance of real service to the state in order that you may carry
01:02:37.22 --> 01:02:50.54 out your duty as soldiers thus responding to the boundless imperial benevolence.
01:02:50.54 --> 01:02:58.54 So like I said, there's parts of that document that you can't really argue with.
01:02:58.54 --> 01:03:00.98 And it's a powerful document, it's a powerful code.
01:03:00.98 --> 01:03:12.66 And that document obviously helped guide the actions of the military in Japan and of the
01:03:12.66 --> 01:03:26.06 nation of Japan who were highly committed to this cause.
01:03:26.06 --> 01:03:31.94 But one more letter from a Kamakaze.
01:03:31.94 --> 01:03:35.62 Dear mother and father, now it has been decided that I will participate in a sortie
01:03:35.62 --> 01:03:40.62 as a member of the Kamakaze Special Attack Corps Squadron.
01:03:40.62 --> 01:03:45.46 I am deeply satisfied that nothing will surpass this as the long cherished desire of a
01:03:45.46 --> 01:03:51.94 military man to die and attacking an enemy ship together with his aircraft.
01:03:51.94 --> 01:03:57.42 When I think of my 23 years of life, I have not been able to repay anything for your
01:03:57.42 --> 01:03:58.42 kindness.
01:03:58.42 --> 01:04:01.94 However with a smile, please forgive me from the beginning.
01:04:01.94 --> 01:04:05.50 I offered myself for the country.
01:04:05.50 --> 01:04:10.74 The war is plunging into an increasingly critical period.
01:04:10.74 --> 01:04:15.62 But I believe in victory for the Empire.
01:04:15.62 --> 01:04:17.94 I believe others will follow after me.
01:04:17.94 --> 01:04:22.62 I will make a body crashing attack against an enemy ship.
01:04:22.62 --> 01:04:29.22 I am resolved that I will repay a ten thousandth of the Emperor's kindness.
01:04:29.22 --> 01:04:35.94 I have not been as thankful as today to be born a Japanese person.
01:04:35.94 --> 01:04:41.06 I, thy humble subject, live not in vain.
01:04:41.06 --> 01:04:46.50 Having seen both heaven and earth prosper in this glorious age of vine.
01:04:46.50 --> 01:04:51.58 This is an old poem and it is my state of mind.
01:04:51.58 --> 01:04:57.98 Please give regards to my teachers at elementary school, junior high school and teachers
01:04:57.98 --> 01:05:02.26 in college, all of the relatives and the villagers.
01:05:02.26 --> 01:05:07.70 Finally I am praying for the welfare of everyone in the family, bravely I will fall
01:05:07.70 --> 01:05:11.54 knowing the way of samurai.
01:05:11.54 --> 01:05:16.46 For the Emperor who gave blessings.
01:05:16.46 --> 01:05:23.74 So, Ensign Shijio Kaira.
01:05:23.74 --> 01:05:37.02 And at twelve forty five on April 6, 1945, Ensign Kaira took off from Kusheira Air Base
01:05:37.02 --> 01:05:49.38 and carried out his suicide attack off the coast of Okanawa.
01:05:49.38 --> 01:06:00.02 And when you hear this code, when you hear these letters, you have to think yourself,
01:06:00.02 --> 01:06:11.46 who could defeat an enemy that is that determined what warrior culture could have the values
01:06:11.46 --> 01:06:20.94 and the courage to contend with and to actually defeat a people possessed with such willingness
01:06:20.94 --> 01:06:26.14 to make sacrifices.
01:06:26.14 --> 01:06:31.82 Such willingness to die for their cause, that is what you have to ask yourself.
01:06:31.82 --> 01:06:41.74 That is what I ask myself is what people could oppose and fight against this warrior
01:06:41.74 --> 01:06:46.14 breed.
01:06:46.14 --> 01:06:52.50 And the answer to that question and this isn't a theoretical answer, but it is a factual
01:06:52.50 --> 01:06:54.14 answer.
01:06:54.14 --> 01:07:07.18 So warrior culture that faced and defeated this fanatics society was the United States of America.
01:07:07.18 --> 01:07:14.82 And it was our own hardened breed of warriors from the army, navy, air force and marines
01:07:14.82 --> 01:07:20.54 the American warrior culture.
01:07:20.54 --> 01:07:28.22 The American warrior culture is what went from island to island and beach head to beach head
01:07:28.22 --> 01:07:37.02 and pill box to pill box fighting and sacrificing.
01:07:37.02 --> 01:07:48.70 Not only with a willingness to die, which they certainly had, but with a stronger willingness
01:07:48.70 --> 01:08:00.58 to live, to live and not to live a life of subservience and obedience, but a life of
01:08:00.58 --> 01:08:12.42 something much more powerful than all of that, a life of freedom.
01:08:12.42 --> 01:08:23.42 And that culture, that American culture of individual freedom has proven out to be the most
01:08:23.42 --> 01:08:30.74 powerful force in the world.
01:08:30.74 --> 01:08:36.78 And for us to be able to protect that freedom, what we do is we voluntarily impose discipline
01:08:36.78 --> 01:08:40.82 on ourselves.
01:08:40.82 --> 01:08:42.98 We have the things that this book talked about.
01:08:42.98 --> 01:08:45.38 We have conviction to win.
01:08:45.38 --> 01:08:47.50 We believe in loyalty and responsibility.
01:08:47.50 --> 01:08:52.66 We live with honor and valor and we work together to protect each other.
01:08:52.66 --> 01:09:00.50 But we don't do that because we're mandated to do that.
01:09:00.50 --> 01:09:07.02 We do it so we can defend our way of life.
01:09:07.02 --> 01:09:18.62 We make sacrifices to preserve our culture because our way of life offers something.
01:09:18.62 --> 01:09:28.70 Something that is the apex of human existence.
01:09:28.70 --> 01:09:33.98 Freedom.
01:09:33.98 --> 01:09:40.86 Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
01:09:40.86 --> 01:09:45.02 Then that's why we fight.
01:09:45.02 --> 01:09:47.66 And that's why we win.
01:09:47.66 --> 01:09:48.82 We don't fight for glory.
01:09:48.82 --> 01:09:50.46 We don't fight for personal gain.
01:09:50.46 --> 01:09:53.94 We don't fight to impose our will onto others.
01:09:53.94 --> 01:10:01.34 But we fight for freedom.
01:10:01.34 --> 01:10:05.78 Freedom itself, that is our ideal.
01:10:05.78 --> 01:10:11.22 That is our standard.
01:10:11.22 --> 01:10:21.46 And we will never, ever surrender that ideal.
01:10:21.46 --> 01:10:31.02 The ideal of freedom is our code.
01:10:31.02 --> 01:10:43.54 And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
01:10:43.54 --> 01:10:44.54 Echo Charles.
01:10:44.54 --> 01:10:47.10 Yeah, it's good.
01:10:47.10 --> 01:10:52.74 We are trying to maintain our freedom in order to do that.
01:10:52.74 --> 01:10:58.66 We all know that we have to impose some discipline on ourselves.
01:10:58.66 --> 01:11:05.66 That means putting in the work means trying to get better.
01:11:05.66 --> 01:11:06.66 Sure.
01:11:06.66 --> 01:11:13.66 You got some things that might help us as we had down that path.
01:11:13.66 --> 01:11:14.66 Yeah, very much so.
01:11:14.66 --> 01:11:25.14 But the imperial, the emperor seems like that's the part that kind of jammed everything
01:11:25.14 --> 01:11:26.14 up.
01:11:26.14 --> 01:11:30.02 The whole code, like the whole, what is this man?
01:11:30.02 --> 01:11:33.62 You will call imperial rescript for soldiers and sailors.
01:11:33.62 --> 01:11:35.90 Yeah, it's like man, this is all good.
01:11:35.90 --> 01:11:38.38 It's all good except that one spot.
01:11:38.38 --> 01:11:41.02 There were like, yeah, the emperor is like a lion.
01:11:41.02 --> 01:11:42.90 Kind of as if to say okay.
01:11:42.90 --> 01:11:47.38 But at the end of the day, like you got to listen to this like one.
01:11:47.38 --> 01:11:53.18 Whereas at the end of the day, what we do is individual freedom.
01:11:53.18 --> 01:11:54.18 Yeah.
01:11:54.18 --> 01:11:55.18 What else?
01:11:55.18 --> 01:11:56.18 Yeah.
01:11:56.18 --> 01:11:59.78 Like we were collectively protecting this freedom that we have.
01:11:59.78 --> 01:12:01.82 And we do that together.
01:12:01.82 --> 01:12:04.78 But once we have that freedom, it's not about for someone else.
01:12:04.78 --> 01:12:06.78 It's for the individual.
01:12:06.78 --> 01:12:08.62 It's for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
01:12:08.62 --> 01:12:10.38 That's what we're doing over here.
01:12:10.38 --> 01:12:16.26 That's what the, that's what Western culture is about.
01:12:16.26 --> 01:12:17.42 Yeah.
01:12:17.42 --> 01:12:21.50 And you know the fact that you have all this code written and everything right, you have
01:12:21.50 --> 01:12:23.90 these people raised the bushydo mindset and all that.
01:12:23.90 --> 01:12:28.94 But like the marines are going on to the beach at Guadalcanal.
01:12:28.94 --> 01:12:30.22 Yeah.
01:12:30.22 --> 01:12:32.30 That's what's going to happen.
01:12:32.30 --> 01:12:39.38 And going into a fortified island, you're at a complete disadvantage.
01:12:39.38 --> 01:12:43.10 Don't, don't, don't let anyone forget that.
01:12:43.10 --> 01:12:47.34 When you're going again, when you're on the offense against a defensive position, you
01:12:47.34 --> 01:12:49.58 are at a complete disadvantage.
01:12:49.58 --> 01:12:51.46 That's the way it is.
01:12:51.46 --> 01:13:02.02 And so this, this warrior culture that sometimes we put up on a pedestal because it sounds
01:13:02.02 --> 01:13:04.14 cool.
01:13:04.14 --> 01:13:05.14 It sounds cool.
01:13:05.14 --> 01:13:10.90 The imperial rescript sounds cool when you put this code out, right?
01:13:10.90 --> 01:13:14.46 But what you, what you just said is correct.
01:13:14.46 --> 01:13:23.74 And that code is not based and not the foundation of it isn't freedom.
01:13:23.74 --> 01:13:25.78 It doesn't turn out good.
01:13:25.78 --> 01:13:26.78 Yeah.
01:13:26.78 --> 01:13:32.46 And it's essentially like it sounds cool because you know how you, it kind of ties
01:13:32.46 --> 01:13:33.46 into it or you, okay.
01:13:33.46 --> 01:13:34.66 So this line equals freedom.
01:13:34.66 --> 01:13:35.66 We'll say, right.
01:13:35.66 --> 01:13:36.66 We'll start with that.
01:13:36.66 --> 01:13:37.66 You can say that.
01:13:37.66 --> 01:13:40.74 So this is a plain sounds cool and equals freedom.
01:13:40.74 --> 01:13:42.22 That whole thing sounds cool whatever.
01:13:42.22 --> 01:13:45.58 So this Bouchito thing kind of just seems like just the discipline part.
01:13:45.58 --> 01:13:49.22 So of course that part of it sounds cool, but when you look at big picture, you know how
01:13:49.22 --> 01:13:50.54 not cool that is?
01:13:50.54 --> 01:13:51.54 Yeah.
01:13:51.54 --> 01:13:56.46 Especially like to have to bow down to like some group of people that's the way it is.
01:13:56.46 --> 01:13:57.46 Exactly.
01:13:57.46 --> 01:13:58.46 Yeah.
01:13:58.46 --> 01:13:59.46 So you step back, you look at that.
01:13:59.46 --> 01:14:01.06 You're like, man, this isn't cool.
01:14:01.06 --> 01:14:03.10 Actually this is like kind of bad.
01:14:03.10 --> 01:14:10.54 Especially when you get corruption, which is kind of, it's one of the, I forget the same,
01:14:10.54 --> 01:14:13.54 but it's like absolute power is absolutely.
01:14:13.54 --> 01:14:14.54 Absolutely.
01:14:14.54 --> 01:14:15.54 Yeah.
01:14:15.54 --> 01:14:16.54 Yeah.
01:14:16.54 --> 01:14:20.10 So the man, so you kind of consider that and that's a big picture thing too.
01:14:20.10 --> 01:14:21.50 Because no one knows about it.
01:14:21.50 --> 01:14:24.98 I mean, I was saying no one comes out of the gate crap, but that's not true either.
01:14:24.98 --> 01:14:28.38 But when you can have something like this where it's like, hey, the emperor there, you
01:14:28.38 --> 01:14:32.50 know, they're benevolent, they're defined, you know, all this stuff or whatever.
01:14:32.50 --> 01:14:36.90 And it's like, yeah, okay, that sounds cool, but man, after a while, big picture, you're like,
01:14:36.90 --> 01:14:41.66 okay, I'm well, you're not divine, you're just a person and the whole absolute power
01:14:41.66 --> 01:14:45.30 crept us absolutely, it's like that's a very high likelihood and all this stuff.
01:14:45.30 --> 01:14:50.70 So given that, that they can just say whatever they want, they can be like, hey, I don't
01:14:50.70 --> 01:14:53.22 care 18 year old kid out of high school or whatever.
01:14:53.22 --> 01:14:55.42 Oh, yeah, we need to use you as a bullet.
01:14:55.42 --> 01:14:57.22 That's really what they're doing.
01:14:57.22 --> 01:15:01.54 Especially like the numbers, the numbers are like, bro, you killed one Japanese person
01:15:01.54 --> 01:15:04.94 for like every one point, something other person, like enemy.
01:15:04.94 --> 01:15:09.70 So it's like, about two bullets are worth more than you, really, in a way, you know, and
01:15:09.70 --> 01:15:14.34 some like person can just sort of make that determination with your whole life.
01:15:14.34 --> 01:15:16.66 I don't know, man, that doesn't sound good.
01:15:16.66 --> 01:15:23.62 Yeah, and that's why this whole, this whole thing, this, it just boils down to, it just
01:15:23.62 --> 01:15:26.10 boils down to, and it's such an overuse word, man.
01:15:26.10 --> 01:15:28.14 It boils down to freedom.
01:15:28.14 --> 01:15:30.30 That's what it boils down to.
01:15:30.30 --> 01:15:37.34 Like when you are a man and you're from Iowa and you're in the Marine Corps and you're
01:15:37.34 --> 01:15:47.18 going on to that beach, you're will as a free man is stronger than the will of this guy
01:15:47.18 --> 01:15:49.50 over on the other side.
01:15:49.50 --> 01:15:52.62 That is not truly free.
01:15:52.62 --> 01:15:58.62 And that, that right there, that's the, that's the crazy thing about this is you can
01:15:58.62 --> 01:16:06.06 take this, this entire warrior culture where these people are born and raised and caught
01:16:06.06 --> 01:16:07.54 this.
01:16:07.54 --> 01:16:13.46 And you see, you know, there's there's training videos for the Kamikaze, but even just
01:16:13.46 --> 01:16:19.42 the, just the militant life that these, the militaristic life that they led.
01:16:19.42 --> 01:16:25.58 And meanwhile, you take someone that was a shoe cobbler in Boston and you take another guy
01:16:25.58 --> 01:16:32.78 that was a farmer in Iowa and you take another guy that worked on the railroad in California
01:16:32.78 --> 01:16:42.58 and you put them together in a foxhole and there will to fight as free men is stronger than
01:16:42.58 --> 01:16:52.18 someone that was raised since birth to be a warrior, freedom and the individual human will
01:16:52.18 --> 01:16:58.62 to do what you want to do with your life as such is the most powerful force and it gets left,
01:16:58.62 --> 01:17:00.62 it gets left behind.
01:17:00.62 --> 01:17:03.70 And if you leave it behind, you might win for a little while, but you're not going to win
01:17:03.70 --> 01:17:06.78 in the long run.
01:17:06.78 --> 01:17:13.38 And that's the, that's the force, if you take that to a personal level, that's the force
01:17:13.38 --> 01:17:20.34 that you can use to drive discipline in your life because you want, you, you don't impose
01:17:20.34 --> 01:17:23.54 discipline on yourself for, for the sake of discipline.
01:17:23.54 --> 01:17:24.54 Yeah.
01:17:24.54 --> 01:17:27.42 That's going to be, you can, you can, you can do that, you can do that today, you can
01:17:27.42 --> 01:17:29.62 do that tomorrow, you can do that next week.
01:17:29.62 --> 01:17:34.58 But you can't do that for two years, three years.
01:17:34.58 --> 01:17:43.94 You need, it needs to be the foundation of the discipline needs to be the desire for freedom.
01:17:43.94 --> 01:17:45.46 That's what it has to be rooted in.
01:17:45.46 --> 01:17:47.66 At least that's for me.
01:17:47.66 --> 01:17:49.46 For me, that's what it's rooted in.
01:17:49.46 --> 01:17:50.46 Yeah.
01:17:50.46 --> 01:17:54.46 And like, okay, discipline for the sake of discipline, that sounds cool.
01:17:54.46 --> 01:17:55.46 Yeah.
01:17:55.46 --> 01:17:56.46 Right.
01:17:56.46 --> 01:17:57.46 Sounds awesome.
01:17:57.46 --> 01:17:58.46 Dig into it a little bit.
01:17:58.46 --> 01:17:59.46 Right.
01:17:59.46 --> 01:18:00.46 Not big.
01:18:00.46 --> 01:18:01.46 Dig into it a little bit.
01:18:01.46 --> 01:18:02.46 And what do you find?
01:18:02.46 --> 01:18:05.46 It's got to be discipline for freedom.
01:18:05.46 --> 01:18:11.46 And it's, and it's, it's functional on the battlefield.
01:18:11.46 --> 01:18:17.46 And it's functional in your life.
01:18:17.46 --> 01:18:20.86 You know, it's the same thing with the same thing with the Nazis.
01:18:20.86 --> 01:18:27.38 The Nazis were a martial culture.
01:18:27.38 --> 01:18:30.10 You know, that's what they were.
01:18:30.10 --> 01:18:33.54 But they were subservient to the fear.
01:18:33.54 --> 01:18:35.02 And guess what happens?
01:18:35.02 --> 01:18:41.82 When you take, guess what happens when you take a kid from North Carolina.
01:18:41.82 --> 01:18:44.22 And you take another kid from Florida.
01:18:44.22 --> 01:18:47.94 You take another kid from Tennessee.
01:18:47.94 --> 01:18:49.26 And you take those kids.
01:18:49.26 --> 01:18:51.10 They're not professional soldiers.
01:18:51.10 --> 01:18:52.78 They're going to go to boot camp.
01:18:52.78 --> 01:18:55.14 They're going to get trained in whatever they're going to get trained in.
01:18:55.14 --> 01:18:56.14 They're not right.
01:18:56.14 --> 01:18:59.62 They're not Hitler youth raised to fight.
01:18:59.62 --> 01:19:04.46 You ever seen little little Hitler youth training with weapons when they're 12 years old?
01:19:04.46 --> 01:19:07.34 Like meanwhile, this kid was in Tennessee, working on a farm.
01:19:07.34 --> 01:19:13.70 This other kid was in Brooklyn, working in a pizza shop, working on a restaurant, whatever.
01:19:13.70 --> 01:19:21.18 So you take these folks that are fighting for the fearer.
01:19:21.18 --> 01:19:28.02 And you put them up against someone that a group of people that are fighting for freedom.
01:19:28.02 --> 01:19:32.62 And freedom is going to win.
01:19:32.62 --> 01:19:34.22 You're right about it.
01:19:34.22 --> 01:19:38.34 Yeah, it's interesting.
01:19:38.34 --> 01:19:40.70 Like the freedom to do jiu-jitsu by the way.
01:19:40.70 --> 01:19:44.14 And the freedom to get any kind of gui-y-y-one.
01:19:44.14 --> 01:19:45.42 You're going to get the best gui.
01:19:45.42 --> 01:19:46.42 So I don't know.
01:19:46.42 --> 01:19:47.42 Squallified is a rough transition.
01:19:47.42 --> 01:19:52.66 Well, I'm just saying that's the first thing they came to mind at that point when you
01:19:52.66 --> 01:19:55.54 said that nonetheless, anyway, we're on the path.
01:19:55.54 --> 01:19:56.54 Yes, discipline.
01:19:56.54 --> 01:20:03.02 The path is the path of discipline that ends in, not ends in, but results in freedom.
01:20:03.02 --> 01:20:04.02 Yeah.
01:20:04.02 --> 01:20:10.26 So on this path, many activities, many things to do and to not do, by the way.
01:20:10.26 --> 01:20:13.62 And you know what you were talking about earlier with this salute thing.
01:20:13.62 --> 01:20:14.62 Yes.
01:20:14.62 --> 01:20:16.62 Look at that for a second.
01:20:16.62 --> 01:20:17.62 Right?
01:20:17.62 --> 01:20:20.62 If I'm a guy that's like, has an attitude.
01:20:20.62 --> 01:20:22.82 Look, I'm not salute anyone.
01:20:22.82 --> 01:20:24.82 Yeah.
01:20:24.82 --> 01:20:26.22 I'm not disciplining myself.
01:20:26.22 --> 01:20:27.22 Well, guess what?
01:20:27.22 --> 01:20:29.10 Then I'm not going to do anything in the military.
01:20:29.10 --> 01:20:30.54 I'm going to get kicked out of the military, actually.
01:20:30.54 --> 01:20:33.38 I'm going to lose the freedom to serve.
01:20:33.38 --> 01:20:36.18 Whereas if you discipline yourself like, hey, I'm going to show respect to the people
01:20:36.18 --> 01:20:38.74 that are above me and the chain of command, I'm going to do a good job.
01:20:38.74 --> 01:20:39.74 Yeah.
01:20:39.74 --> 01:20:40.74 I'm going to discipline myself.
01:20:40.74 --> 01:20:41.74 Yes, what?
01:20:41.74 --> 01:20:42.74 It's ridiculous.
01:20:42.74 --> 01:20:47.70 This is going to sound so ridiculous.
01:20:47.70 --> 01:20:53.82 For the most part, I could pretty much do whatever I wanted to when I was in the military.
01:20:53.82 --> 01:20:55.82 As crazy as that sounds.
01:20:55.82 --> 01:20:57.66 As crazy as that sounds.
01:20:57.66 --> 01:21:00.82 My boss is always gave me what I wanted.
01:21:00.82 --> 01:21:05.42 My, I could just kind of do what I wanted to do.
01:21:05.42 --> 01:21:07.14 It was crazy.
01:21:07.14 --> 01:21:09.70 It was crazy when I looked back on it now.
01:21:09.70 --> 01:21:13.22 And my bosses would give me what I want and help me and support me.
01:21:13.22 --> 01:21:14.22 Why did they do that?
01:21:14.22 --> 01:21:15.74 They didn't do it because I was manipulating.
01:21:15.74 --> 01:21:19.14 They did it because I was working hard and supporting what they wanted to get done.
01:21:19.14 --> 01:21:21.10 And it's like a positive thing.
01:21:21.10 --> 01:21:22.10 It's not negative at all.
01:21:22.10 --> 01:21:24.82 It's like it was awesome.
01:21:24.82 --> 01:21:29.10 But if you, and if you have that attitude in life, like, hey, I'm going to work hard,
01:21:29.10 --> 01:21:33.46 I'm going to discipline myself.
01:21:33.46 --> 01:21:38.70 I'm going to submit in situations that require it.
01:21:38.70 --> 01:21:43.90 I'm going to subordinate my ego in situations that require it now.
01:21:43.90 --> 01:21:49.62 So that in the long run, I can get the freedom.
01:21:49.62 --> 01:21:53.78 So often people, they don't want to, they want the freedom right now.
01:21:53.78 --> 01:21:55.46 Freedom isn't going to come right now.
01:21:55.46 --> 01:21:57.18 You don't get it.
01:21:57.18 --> 01:21:59.66 You have to work for it.
01:21:59.66 --> 01:22:01.46 You have to fight for it.
01:22:01.46 --> 01:22:06.18 You have to impose discipline on your life so that you can end up with it.
01:22:06.18 --> 01:22:08.78 You have to work hard.
01:22:08.78 --> 01:22:14.38 You have to work hard to get to a point when you get the freedom.
01:22:14.38 --> 01:22:18.54 But if you don't work hard, you won't end up with it.
01:22:18.54 --> 01:22:19.54 You just won't.
01:22:19.54 --> 01:22:24.98 You'll always end up being a slave to your paycheck.
01:22:24.98 --> 01:22:29.38 You'll be a slave to your jacked up friends.
01:22:29.38 --> 01:22:34.50 You'll be a slave to the manipulative partner you chose.
01:22:34.50 --> 01:22:38.54 You'll be a slave if you don't put discipline in your world.
01:22:38.54 --> 01:22:39.54 You'll be a slave to drugs.
01:22:39.54 --> 01:22:41.54 You'll be a slave to alcohol.
01:22:41.54 --> 01:22:42.74 You can be a slave to food.
01:22:42.74 --> 01:22:43.90 You can be a slave to doctors.
01:22:43.90 --> 01:22:48.02 Yeah, you can be a slave to all these things.
01:22:48.02 --> 01:22:52.66 So it's just you got to think about freedom.
01:22:52.66 --> 01:22:54.62 You got to have that in the back of your mind.
01:22:54.62 --> 01:22:58.86 But you can't live your life thinking that it's going to be given to you.
01:22:58.86 --> 01:22:59.86 Oh, free.
01:22:59.86 --> 01:23:00.86 No, it's not.
01:23:00.86 --> 01:23:02.58 Freedom isn't free, as they say.
01:23:02.58 --> 01:23:07.74 As this freedom isn't free in a country.
01:23:07.74 --> 01:23:09.82 And freedom certainly isn't free in your own personal life.
01:23:09.82 --> 01:23:10.82 It's not free.
01:23:10.82 --> 01:23:11.82 Oh, no.
01:23:11.82 --> 01:23:17.70 Yeah, like we talked about this earlier on where you're going to have to pay the price.
01:23:17.70 --> 01:23:20.70 You know, when you know, pay now, pay later, whatever.
01:23:20.70 --> 01:23:21.70 You say.
01:23:21.70 --> 01:23:27.14 So the whole pain now, I think that's the way to go.
01:23:27.14 --> 01:23:28.70 Paying now is definitely the way to go.
01:23:28.70 --> 01:23:29.70 Yeah.
01:23:29.70 --> 01:23:31.50 Yeah, you always got to pay.
01:23:31.50 --> 01:23:32.86 And it's a constant thing.
01:23:32.86 --> 01:23:36.70 And that that part can kind of be intimidating, you know, where it's like, like, let's say,
01:23:36.70 --> 01:23:41.46 you know, the real obvious one, it's like eating correctly and exercising.
01:23:41.46 --> 01:23:42.46 Right.
01:23:42.46 --> 01:23:43.46 Like that's.
01:23:43.46 --> 01:23:48.58 Well, what's good about those is they, their physical activities that have physical
01:23:48.58 --> 01:23:51.34 visible manifestations, right?
01:23:51.34 --> 01:23:54.54 If you eat like crap, you're going to feel like crap, you're going to look like
01:23:54.54 --> 01:23:56.50 crap, you're going to perform by crap.
01:23:56.50 --> 01:23:57.50 Yeah.
01:23:57.50 --> 01:24:01.34 If you are inactive, you're going to move like crap.
01:24:01.34 --> 01:24:03.94 You're going to be sick.
01:24:03.94 --> 01:24:06.10 So yeah, those are real clear.
01:24:06.10 --> 01:24:07.10 Yeah.
01:24:07.10 --> 01:24:08.10 So examples.
01:24:08.10 --> 01:24:12.58 So it's like so clear where you can be like, okay, I'm going to pay now.
01:24:12.58 --> 01:24:13.58 Right.
01:24:13.58 --> 01:24:15.50 How am I going to pay now and what price am I going to pay now?
01:24:15.50 --> 01:24:21.82 And that's with like, yeah, not eating things that you're so physically compelled to, yeah,
01:24:21.82 --> 01:24:27.22 for the most part, exercising, which can be a pain literally.
01:24:27.22 --> 01:24:31.30 And so, you know, most of the time you don't like,
01:24:31.30 --> 01:24:36.42 want to exit like that's not a natural thing, I think, to like, I would say that's
01:24:36.42 --> 01:24:37.42 true.
01:24:37.42 --> 01:24:39.78 I would say actually your right, I would say that you're right to the point where
01:24:39.78 --> 01:24:44.82 a normal human being is genetically programmed if they can conserve energy, then you
01:24:44.82 --> 01:24:46.26 want to conserve energy.
01:24:46.26 --> 01:24:49.66 Because otherwise, if you didn't have that instinct, you would waste all your energy
01:24:49.66 --> 01:24:51.46 as a caveman and you would die, right?
01:24:51.46 --> 01:24:52.62 Because you starve to death.
01:24:52.62 --> 01:24:59.10 So no, I think we're genetically programmed to to lean towards less activity.
01:24:59.10 --> 01:25:00.10 Yeah.
01:25:00.10 --> 01:25:05.10 Our energy conservation is what we're probably genetically programmed to do.
01:25:05.10 --> 01:25:06.10 Yeah.
01:25:06.10 --> 01:25:07.10 Yeah, genetic.
01:25:07.10 --> 01:25:09.70 Now you get it if you're sitting in an office all day and then you're like,
01:25:09.70 --> 01:25:11.02 we're going to go for run tonight.
01:25:11.02 --> 01:25:12.02 Yeah, of course.
01:25:12.02 --> 01:25:13.22 Yes, sitting in an office all day.
01:25:13.22 --> 01:25:16.22 So there's got to be some instinct to do that as well.
01:25:16.22 --> 01:25:21.10 But yeah, but most time too, though, if you're going to go for a run or go lift or something,
01:25:21.10 --> 01:25:24.66 like you're already familiar with like the payoff of that.
01:25:24.66 --> 01:25:25.66 Yeah.
01:25:25.66 --> 01:25:27.46 No, it's pretty rare.
01:25:27.46 --> 01:25:31.38 Maybe if you want to go plant plant the pool or something, I guess.
01:25:31.38 --> 01:25:32.38 But that's different.
01:25:32.38 --> 01:25:39.62 Like, no one's just genetically yearning to go do a met con or something, run like a marathon or something.
01:25:39.62 --> 01:25:40.62 Like that.
01:25:40.62 --> 01:25:42.14 Well, that's why I kind of threw that out there a little bit.
01:25:42.14 --> 01:25:48.46 Because sometimes if you, for me, yeah, like sometimes for you, no, but but for real, right?
01:25:48.46 --> 01:25:51.22 Let's say you could work out for two days.
01:25:51.22 --> 01:25:53.90 Do you have like a little like thing that's bad.
01:25:53.90 --> 01:25:55.54 I can't even get their jerks up.
01:25:55.54 --> 01:25:56.54 Yeah, big time.
01:25:56.54 --> 01:26:00.78 But then, so there's right, but that's for someone who's already collecting that payoff.
01:26:00.78 --> 01:26:01.78 Okay, I got it.
01:26:01.78 --> 01:26:05.46 And it's like, and he goes to, and we talked about this too, where that's kind of the same.
01:26:05.46 --> 01:26:08.14 Sometimes you just don't, don't you just like to just go get something.
01:26:08.14 --> 01:26:09.14 Yes.
01:26:09.14 --> 01:26:10.86 But only for the payoff.
01:26:10.86 --> 01:26:12.50 Something like to get some just to get something.
01:26:12.50 --> 01:26:13.50 Oh, because we're you.
01:26:13.50 --> 01:26:21.66 Well, and that's like, I was going to say that that's like one of the benefits of working.
01:26:21.66 --> 01:26:25.02 And this is, we're just talking about working out with this goes for kind of everything, where
01:26:25.02 --> 01:26:29.66 if you familiarize yourself over the years of the payoff, like your body kind of accommodates
01:26:29.66 --> 01:26:33.94 that, like your body's like, if you don't, you get a door fence and you get addicted to it.
01:26:33.94 --> 01:26:34.94 Yeah, right?
01:26:34.94 --> 01:26:35.94 And that's how we're talking about.
01:26:35.94 --> 01:26:37.30 Yeah, that becomes how you work.
01:26:37.30 --> 01:26:41.22 But let's say, like, okay, let's say I'm, I don't know, 35 years old will say, I've never
01:26:41.22 --> 01:26:42.22 really worked out ever.
01:26:42.22 --> 01:26:43.22 Right?
01:26:43.22 --> 01:26:44.22 Just live a normal life.
01:26:44.22 --> 01:26:46.34 What I just never really worked out, never like lifted weights.
01:26:46.34 --> 01:26:47.34 Never went for run.
01:26:47.34 --> 01:26:50.34 You'll have less of a desire than someone that's been working out their whole life.
01:26:50.34 --> 01:26:52.42 Should I go work out for the first time, a hard one?
01:26:52.42 --> 01:26:54.14 Do you want to jocos work out?
01:26:54.14 --> 01:26:55.14 You can be like, I don't want to do this.
01:26:55.14 --> 01:26:56.14 I don't want to do this.
01:26:56.14 --> 01:27:00.50 You're going to be thinking that while you're doing it and the next day when you're all
01:27:00.50 --> 01:27:03.30 sorry, you can be like, I don't want to do that ever again, actually.
01:27:03.30 --> 01:27:04.30 So it's different.
01:27:04.30 --> 01:27:08.22 But if you're you or someone who's like, you know, an athlete all their life or something
01:27:08.22 --> 01:27:16.66 like that, someone who who reap the benefits, they know they're familiar with with the payoff.
01:27:16.66 --> 01:27:21.66 Yes, when you don't work out for one day, two days, what, you know, however many days,
01:27:21.66 --> 01:27:26.30 you can be like, your body's going to be like, hey, we need that workout now.
01:27:26.30 --> 01:27:27.30 Kind of thing.
01:27:27.30 --> 01:27:30.70 For short term, short term payoff, we need that workout.
01:27:30.70 --> 01:27:36.18 So again, the benefit of getting into working on a regular basis, you get short term
01:27:36.18 --> 01:27:39.66 and long term payoff.
01:27:39.66 --> 01:27:42.18 And that's what the path is by the way.
01:27:42.18 --> 01:27:44.78 Anyway, same thing for jitsu, jitsu, it's a big one.
01:27:44.78 --> 01:27:48.10 If you take off, you did like, you've been out of jiu jitsu for a little bit because you're
01:27:48.10 --> 01:27:49.70 yeah, yeah, you're hurting right now.
01:27:49.70 --> 01:27:51.70 I'm just walking it.
01:27:51.70 --> 01:27:52.70 Yeah, I just walked out to the gym.
01:27:52.70 --> 01:27:53.70 I kind of looked at Matt.
01:27:53.70 --> 01:27:54.70 I got all excited.
01:27:54.70 --> 01:27:55.70 Yeah.
01:27:55.70 --> 01:27:56.70 You should be back.
01:27:56.70 --> 01:27:57.70 I'll be back.
01:27:57.70 --> 01:27:58.70 You'll be back in a week.
01:27:58.70 --> 01:27:59.70 Right.
01:27:59.70 --> 01:28:00.70 Well, no, sorry, two weeks.
01:28:00.70 --> 01:28:01.70 I'll be back on the Matt's of justice.
01:28:01.70 --> 01:28:02.70 Boom.
01:28:02.70 --> 01:28:03.70 There it is.
01:28:03.70 --> 01:28:07.70 So while you're doing jitsu, if you haven't started jitsu, if you haven't, like, because
01:28:07.70 --> 01:28:12.70 you know, there's a number of people who are like, hey, I hear the things, I'm on the fence.
01:28:12.70 --> 01:28:15.70 You know, they just haven't made the plans.
01:28:15.70 --> 01:28:18.70 They haven't taken the step to even just try it because usually, please, if you go, they'll
01:28:18.70 --> 01:28:19.70 give you it's free.
01:28:19.70 --> 01:28:20.70 Yeah.
01:28:20.70 --> 01:28:21.70 Try for free.
01:28:21.70 --> 01:28:22.70 Yeah.
01:28:22.70 --> 01:28:27.70 That's which tells you that jitsu is good because they don't say, hey, try this for free.
01:28:27.70 --> 01:28:28.70 They don't try and get your money.
01:28:28.70 --> 01:28:29.70 Oh, yeah.
01:28:29.70 --> 01:28:30.70 Just like, come on in.
01:28:30.70 --> 01:28:31.70 Yeah.
01:28:31.70 --> 01:28:33.70 It's like giving away free crack at the school yard.
01:28:33.70 --> 01:28:34.70 Yeah.
01:28:34.70 --> 01:28:35.70 But it's the good kind.
01:28:35.70 --> 01:28:36.70 No.
01:28:36.70 --> 01:28:38.70 We actually have for it's crack that makes you, like, a better human being.
01:28:38.70 --> 01:28:40.70 That's basically what jitsu is.
01:28:40.70 --> 01:28:41.70 It's like a car.
01:28:41.70 --> 01:28:47.70 It's like an addictive drug that makes you better, stronger, smarter, faster, more calm,
01:28:47.70 --> 01:28:48.70 more patient.
01:28:48.70 --> 01:28:50.70 Just a better person.

01:29:02.70 --> 01:29:03.70 should I or should I not?
01:29:03.70 --> 01:29:04.70 Maybe I should.
01:29:04.70 --> 01:29:05.70 Maybe I won't like it.

01:29:14.70 --> 01:29:16.70 I mean, I would never recommend having a defense.
01:29:16.70 --> 01:29:18.70 It's a defensive attitude towards it.
01:29:18.70 --> 01:29:20.70 I would never recommend that.
01:29:20.70 --> 01:29:21.70 But Brad, it's better than I'm going to do.
01:29:21.70 --> 01:29:22.70 Give yourself an attitude.
01:29:22.70 --> 01:29:24.70 If you don't like it, go prove that it sucks.
01:29:24.70 --> 01:29:25.70 Yes.
01:29:25.70 --> 01:29:26.70 Okay.

01:29:29.70 --> 01:29:30.70 Yeah.
01:29:30.70 --> 01:29:34.70 But when you fail to prove that it sucks, and you realize that it's awesome.

01:30:57.70 --> 01:30:59.70 It's a pre-mission situation.
01:30:59.70 --> 01:31:04.70 It's not, but don't get it confused with the traditional pre-workout.
01:31:04.70 --> 01:31:06.70 Stimulate.
01:31:06.70 --> 01:31:12.70 They get you all amped up by some, I was reading someone saying, oh, I don't want to take pre-workout before you get to.
01:31:12.70 --> 01:31:14.70 That's a pre-workout.
01:31:14.70 --> 01:31:21.70 And I don't recommend taking a pre-workout before you get to this has 15 milligrams of caffeine.
01:31:21.70 --> 01:31:22.70 Because that's what people worry about.
01:31:22.70 --> 01:31:23.70 My heart's going to be pumping.
01:31:23.70 --> 01:31:24.70 Right.
01:31:24.70 --> 01:31:25.70 No.
01:31:25.70 --> 01:31:30.70 This is going to, it's going to get you cognitively and physically ready to rock and roll.
01:31:30.70 --> 01:31:31.70 It's going to be primed.
01:31:31.70 --> 01:31:40.70 And discipline go, which is the pill form, when you, when you need, imagine, okay, you know what you feel like when you're in the zone.
01:31:40.70 --> 01:31:41.70 Right.
01:31:41.70 --> 01:31:46.70 Just imagine you could get in the zone like basically on demand.
01:31:46.70 --> 01:31:47.70 Sure.
01:31:47.70 --> 01:31:49.70 That's what's happening here with discipline go.
01:31:49.70 --> 01:31:52.70 You can feel it and it gets you in the zone.
01:31:52.70 --> 01:31:57.70 It's, you know what trips me out is I'll take discipline.
01:31:57.70 --> 01:32:01.70 I'll just go into, you know, speak with the company.
01:32:01.70 --> 01:32:02.70 I'm going to be sitting down.
01:32:02.70 --> 01:32:09.70 There's 20 like smart leaders in a room from a company.
01:32:09.70 --> 01:32:12.70 They got a lot of stuff going on big company.
01:32:12.70 --> 01:32:15.70 And I go in and I've got, I've got to be honest.
01:32:15.70 --> 01:32:18.70 I'm like, do you stop on like three disclin gop.
01:32:18.70 --> 01:32:19.70 You're ready to do that.
01:32:19.70 --> 01:32:20.70 Sorry, Rock, roll.
01:32:20.70 --> 01:32:24.70 But I get in there and I'm, I'm just feeling great, right?
01:32:24.70 --> 01:32:26.70 And I get out of there.
01:32:26.70 --> 01:32:30.70 And I'm like thinking myself, I'm like, you know, I should record it that.
01:32:30.70 --> 01:32:32.70 There's no, I'm not kidding.
01:32:32.70 --> 01:32:37.70 There's times where I go to, I work with a client and I think man, I should record it that.
01:32:37.70 --> 01:32:40.70 I even do phone calls sometimes a client's been like, I should just record it.
01:32:40.70 --> 01:32:41.70 My end.
01:32:41.70 --> 01:32:42.70 Sure.
01:32:42.70 --> 01:32:51.70 Because I'm telling people really important things about planning, about leadership, about decision-making.
01:32:51.70 --> 01:32:52.70 And it's getting lost.
01:32:52.70 --> 01:32:55.70 I mean, I told 20 people, what about everyone else I'm thinking of myself?
01:32:55.70 --> 01:32:58.70 And I'm out of there and I think to myself, I'm like, I was just in the zone.
01:32:58.70 --> 01:32:59.70 I wonder what happened.
01:32:59.70 --> 01:33:03.70 I'm like, oh, I took three discipline goes and I'm ready to rock and roll.
01:33:03.70 --> 01:33:04.70 That's what happened.
01:33:04.70 --> 01:33:05.70 So anyways.
01:33:05.70 --> 01:33:10.70 That sounds like you're like, all freaking, like, proud yourself.
01:33:10.70 --> 01:33:11.70 Like, oh, yeah, yeah, I know.
01:33:11.70 --> 01:33:12.70 I'm so good at what I do.
01:33:12.70 --> 01:33:14.70 But I felt like I cheated.
01:33:14.70 --> 01:33:15.70 But, no, no.
01:33:15.70 --> 01:33:17.70 It actually makes sense though.
01:33:17.70 --> 01:33:19.70 You know how like what you say when you're in the zone?
01:33:19.70 --> 01:33:20.70 Right.
01:33:20.70 --> 01:33:22.70 And you say, you know, like, I don't know even, like, in my case, like,
01:33:22.70 --> 01:33:25.70 you're from my friend, who has me like a question.
01:33:25.70 --> 01:33:29.70 And then I'll be like, wait, and I'll kind of cover all the aspects of the question,
01:33:29.70 --> 01:33:32.70 like, all fluidly, and I'm like, dang, I kind of said that kind of good right there.
01:33:32.70 --> 01:33:34.70 Not that I'm a great speaker, nothing like that.
01:33:34.70 --> 01:33:38.70 But I'm just saying, given the question, he asked at the certain time and the way I answered
01:33:38.70 --> 01:33:39.70 I really feel good about it.
01:33:39.70 --> 01:33:40.70 I really feel good about it.
01:33:40.70 --> 01:33:42.70 That's kind of like what you get into.
01:33:42.70 --> 01:33:44.70 You take, you know, like, you take the discipline.
01:33:44.70 --> 01:33:47.70 It's like, I, it's just, you just kind of flow with it.
01:33:47.70 --> 01:33:49.70 Kind of like surfing or something.
01:33:49.70 --> 01:33:50.70 I started to get a loan.
01:33:50.70 --> 01:33:54.70 Like, is it possible to become addicted to that feeling?
01:33:54.70 --> 01:33:56.70 Well, it depends on what kind of quote, what I'm going to get.
01:33:56.70 --> 01:34:00.70 And he's talking about, because there's psychological addiction, yeah.
01:34:00.70 --> 01:34:01.70 Yeah.
01:34:01.70 --> 01:34:02.70 Like that's the thing.
01:34:02.70 --> 01:34:03.70 But yeah.
01:34:03.70 --> 01:34:04.70 Anyway, that's the discipline.
01:34:04.70 --> 01:34:06.70 And that's the discipline go.
01:34:06.70 --> 01:34:09.70 And then we got some milk.
01:34:09.70 --> 01:34:11.70 And you know what, milk is?

01:36:29.70 --> 01:36:30.70 You know.
01:36:30.70 --> 01:36:32.70 And I was like, oh, that's awesome.
01:36:32.70 --> 01:36:33.70 And the guy I was talking was kind of, I don't know.
01:36:33.70 --> 01:36:36.70 He just had a look on his face like.
01:36:36.70 --> 01:36:41.70 Like I was like saying, oh, it's so awesome that guys are wearing.
01:36:41.70 --> 01:36:43.70 You know, the t shirt.
01:36:43.70 --> 01:36:48.70 And so I said, I said, it's awesome because like that's how the podcast is supported.
01:36:48.70 --> 01:36:52.70 It's like when you buy a t shirt, that's how the podcast is supported.
01:36:52.70 --> 01:36:53.70 So it is cool.
01:36:53.70 --> 01:37:01.70 And it's appreciated if you get a t shirt or a hat or a rash guard or whatever from the
01:37:01.70 --> 01:37:05.70 Jocquist store, because then we can have the podcast.
01:37:05.70 --> 01:37:06.70 Yeah.
01:37:06.70 --> 01:37:07.70 And the good, good.
01:37:07.70 --> 01:37:08.70 Good.
01:37:08.70 --> 01:37:12.70 Good.
01:37:12.70 --> 01:37:13.70 Good.
01:37:13.70 --> 01:37:14.70 Good news about this too though.
01:37:14.70 --> 01:37:16.70 It's not like the shirts and I said this from the beginning.
01:37:16.70 --> 01:37:20.70 I think this was kind of the goal when you know when you make shirts and you produce shirts.
01:37:20.70 --> 01:37:22.70 Yeah.
01:37:22.70 --> 01:37:26.70 It's it seems obvious to be like, oh, yeah, let's just get some shirts.
01:37:26.70 --> 01:37:27.70 No, no, no, no, no.
01:37:27.70 --> 01:37:32.70 I made it a point to get like literally the shirts that like that I wear or that.
01:37:32.70 --> 01:37:35.70 And which we're proving because I made shirts before in the past.
01:37:35.70 --> 01:37:39.70 I've actually been making shirts themselves like six years old to be on the city.
01:37:39.70 --> 01:37:42.70 So I find where you make shirts when you're six years old.
01:37:42.70 --> 01:37:45.70 But I mean, like we explain that a little bit.
01:37:45.70 --> 01:37:48.70 So you get shirt well, because it wasn't like you were running up silk screen.
01:37:48.70 --> 01:37:49.70 Um, operation.
01:37:49.70 --> 01:37:50.70 No, but my mom's a little.
01:37:50.70 --> 01:37:53.70 Yes, my mom's a mom was making shirts when you were six years old.
01:37:53.70 --> 01:37:55.70 Well, it kind of filtered down to us too.
01:37:55.70 --> 01:37:57.70 So they did's airbrush.
01:37:57.70 --> 01:37:58.70 They did silk screen.
01:37:58.70 --> 01:37:59.70 They did.
01:37:59.70 --> 01:38:03.70 I want to see some kid pictures of you with an airbrush t shirt.
01:38:03.70 --> 01:38:06.70 Unicorn rainbow.
01:38:06.70 --> 01:38:07.70 Shaka.
01:38:07.70 --> 01:38:09.70 Shaka, maybe they're, I mean, a lot of flowers.
01:38:09.70 --> 01:38:11.70 A lot of that kind of, it was on quite.
01:38:11.70 --> 01:38:15.70 So there is a, she worked at a place called Tropical shirts.
01:38:15.70 --> 01:38:17.70 Yes, on Hawaiian, low-y.
01:38:17.70 --> 01:38:21.70 Um, right, they shared building with like a can or pineapple cannery.
01:38:21.70 --> 01:38:23.70 I mean, make sure it was really interesting.
01:38:23.70 --> 01:38:24.70 Anyway, that's where we learned.
01:38:24.70 --> 01:38:27.70 Nonetheless, the point is, I mean, get some just random cheap.
01:38:27.70 --> 01:38:28.70 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:38:28.70 --> 01:38:29.70 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:38:29.70 --> 01:38:34.70 So, where are bull shirts is many people. And when I say many, I mean, more than I can, I can't
01:38:34.70 --> 01:38:36.70 recollect like a lot of people.
01:38:36.70 --> 01:38:38.70 Actually, it's actually a lot of people.
01:38:38.70 --> 01:38:40.70 Yeah, a lot of people tell me this too.
01:38:40.70 --> 01:38:44.70 Yeah, that it's the most like their favorite shirt to wear because it fits so good.
01:38:44.70 --> 01:38:45.70 It's like the soft and material.
01:38:45.70 --> 01:38:48.70 It's not just like some rigid thing, you know.
01:38:48.70 --> 01:38:49.70 They're good.
01:38:49.70 --> 01:38:51.70 It's quality stuff is what I'm saying.
01:38:51.70 --> 01:38:54.70 So, you know, Ben, beneficial in checks or that's.
01:38:54.70 --> 01:38:55.70 That's Jocos Door.com.

01:39:09.70 --> 01:39:12.70 And the more subscribers we get, that no, whatever.
01:39:12.70 --> 01:39:15.70 Subscribe to the podcast, get in the game.
01:39:15.70 --> 01:39:17.70 The warrior kid podcast as well.
01:39:17.70 --> 01:39:20.70 It's coming out a little bit infrequently right now.
01:39:20.70 --> 01:39:22.70 But we are getting them out.
01:39:22.70 --> 01:39:24.70 I'm working on another one right now.
01:39:24.70 --> 01:39:27.70 There's plenty of lessons in there for everyone from Uncle Jake.
01:39:27.70 --> 01:39:32.70 And then you can also get some more of your kids soap from Irish Oaks Ranch.com.
01:39:32.70 --> 01:39:35.70 Also, we have a YouTube channel.
01:39:35.70 --> 01:39:36.70 Yeah.
01:39:36.70 --> 01:39:37.70 It's a good channel.
01:39:37.70 --> 01:39:41.70 I think if you're interested in the video, version, that's mainly what it's for.
01:39:41.70 --> 01:39:45.70 Also, there's some excerpts on there that we put out.
01:39:45.70 --> 01:39:50.70 So you don't have to necessarily listen to the whole thing every single time.
01:39:50.70 --> 01:39:51.70 Yeah.
01:39:51.70 --> 01:39:58.70 But whenever I meet someone that has a commute more than 40 minutes to work in front of
01:39:58.70 --> 01:40:01.70 them, they're completely caught up in the podcast.
01:40:01.70 --> 01:40:06.70 When I meet someone that has a commute that's like 10 minutes, they're like, oh, you put
01:40:06.70 --> 01:40:08.70 out these podcasts too fast.
01:40:08.70 --> 01:40:11.70 And I say, well, listen, harg.
01:40:11.70 --> 01:40:14.70 You know, because you can unsan some apps.
01:40:14.70 --> 01:40:18.70 You can play it on the five or whatever to tend to speed.
01:40:18.70 --> 01:40:22.70 I don't know that I would recommend that I've accidentally, you know, something to accidentally
01:40:22.70 --> 01:40:23.70 press the button.
01:40:23.70 --> 01:40:24.70 And it'll go faster.
01:40:24.70 --> 01:40:25.70 It's kind of weird.
01:40:25.70 --> 01:40:29.70 But if you're trying to rush it, you can try to get used to it too.
01:40:29.70 --> 01:40:30.70 Yeah.
01:40:30.70 --> 01:40:34.70 But then the thing is with me a lot of times, obviously, I speak really slow with big
01:40:34.70 --> 01:40:35.70 giant pauses.
01:40:35.70 --> 01:40:36.70 I'm sorry.
01:40:36.70 --> 01:40:37.70 That's just the way I talk.
01:40:37.70 --> 01:40:39.70 But then also sometimes I speak really quickly and put my words together.
01:40:39.70 --> 01:40:40.70 And they kind of flow out.
01:40:40.70 --> 01:40:44.70 If you were listening to this right now at 2.0 speed, you'd be in a world of hurt trying to
01:40:44.70 --> 01:40:45.70 understand what I was talking about.
01:40:45.70 --> 01:40:50.70 So that's when you got to be able to get back to that button hammer it down, get you to slow
01:40:50.70 --> 01:40:53.70 back down to a normal speed of 1.0.
01:40:53.70 --> 01:40:54.70 Oh, 1.0.
01:40:54.70 --> 01:40:55.70 Yeah.
01:40:55.70 --> 01:40:55.70 Sure.
01:40:55.70 --> 01:40:56.70 But yeah.
01:40:56.70 --> 01:40:57.70 Either way, YouTube.
01:40:57.70 --> 01:40:58.70 Yes, YouTube.
01:40:58.70 --> 01:41:00.70 It's a, we do have YouTube channels.
01:41:00.70 --> 01:41:01.70 So yeah, check that out.
01:41:01.70 --> 01:41:02.70 If you're interested in that one.
01:41:02.70 --> 01:41:04.70 Also psychological warfare.
01:41:04.70 --> 01:41:05.70 If you don't know what that is.
01:41:05.70 --> 01:41:08.70 It's an album with tracks, chocolate tracks.
01:41:08.70 --> 01:41:14.70 Getting us all through our moments of weakness if they become prevalent, which they do
01:41:14.70 --> 01:41:15.70 sometime this time.
01:41:15.70 --> 01:41:18.70 They do way less now, by the way.
01:41:18.70 --> 01:41:23.70 But you know, those are on, wherever you can get an MP3, you can get the psychological
01:41:23.70 --> 01:41:24.70 warfare album.
01:41:24.70 --> 01:41:26.70 That's an audio.
01:41:26.70 --> 01:41:29.70 It's an audio reminder.

01:41:46.70 --> 01:41:50.70 That say good things on them to remind you of what you should be doing.
01:41:50.70 --> 01:41:55.70 He just made a new one that says all your excuses are lies.
01:41:55.70 --> 01:41:56.70 I saw them.
01:41:56.70 --> 01:41:59.70 There's no, they're not all fancy.
01:41:59.70 --> 01:42:00.70 Yeah.
01:42:00.70 --> 01:42:02.70 Because nothing fancy about all excuses are lies.
01:42:02.70 --> 01:42:03.70 It's simple.
01:42:03.70 --> 01:42:05.70 It's going for the simplicity element.
01:42:05.70 --> 01:42:06.70 Yes.

01:42:23.70 --> 01:42:25.70 So warrior bars.
01:42:25.70 --> 01:42:26.70 Here's the thing.
01:42:26.70 --> 01:42:30.70 I haven't been talking about the warrior bars, but those warrior bars are like key.
01:42:30.70 --> 01:42:34.70 They're, they're a, they're a good to have on the standby scenario.
01:42:34.70 --> 01:42:35.70 Oh, yeah.
01:42:35.70 --> 01:42:38.70 And even like, that's like a semi daily.
01:42:38.70 --> 01:42:41.70 What is semi daily? Is that every other day semi daily?
01:42:41.70 --> 01:42:44.70 It's not necessarily important.
01:42:44.70 --> 01:42:45.70 Yeah.
01:42:45.70 --> 01:42:46.70 Semi daily.
01:42:46.70 --> 01:42:50.70 Well, my frequency with these warrior bars is protein impact.
01:42:50.70 --> 01:42:52.70 Uh, food.
01:42:52.70 --> 01:42:55.70 They're not like, like, you know, a power bar.
01:42:55.70 --> 01:42:56.70 Yeah.
01:42:56.70 --> 01:42:57.70 It's not like that.
01:42:57.70 --> 01:42:59.70 It's like a protein meat.
01:42:59.70 --> 01:43:01.70 Anyway, it's called a warrior bar.
01:43:01.70 --> 01:43:03.70 Anyway, that's every other day.
01:43:03.70 --> 01:43:06.70 I would say it's like, I don't even like these words snack.
01:43:06.70 --> 01:43:08.70 Because it doesn't feel like a snack.
01:43:08.70 --> 01:43:13.70 It's like a hybrid snack slash meal protein, ish.
01:43:13.70 --> 01:43:16.70 Anyway, nonetheless, there's a lot of cool stuff on there.
01:43:16.70 --> 01:43:17.70 Cattle bells on there.
01:43:17.70 --> 01:43:21.70 Are you, are you, you say artistic kettle bells, even though they are artistic,
01:43:21.70 --> 01:43:22.70 but I do.
01:43:22.70 --> 01:43:27.70 I feel like it doesn't capture the glory of the kettle bells.
01:43:27.70 --> 01:43:29.70 Nonetheless, primal bells.
01:43:29.70 --> 01:43:31.70 Legend bells, where I get them.
01:43:31.70 --> 01:43:33.70 What do they call the Star Wars bells?
01:43:33.70 --> 01:43:35.70 They call them space bells.
01:43:35.70 --> 01:43:37.70 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
01:43:37.70 --> 01:43:41.70 Uh, I don't think they have a name for the group yet, but yes.

01:46:49.70 --> 01:46:55.70 and this is the reason we created it is because we work with companies that have 62,000 employees.
01:46:55.70 --> 01:46:59.70 And they say, hey, Jocco, can you train all of your employees?
01:46:59.70 --> 01:47:02.70 They're around the world. And I say, no, I can't.
01:47:02.70 --> 01:47:05.70 No, I actually say, stand by.

01:47:07.70 --> 01:47:09.70 And then it's, hey, we created it.

01:47:47.70 --> 01:47:50.70 Trust me, you put them in there. It's not about manufacturing.
01:47:50.70 --> 01:47:55.70 He'll learn about the manufacturing. But what he's going to know, what he knows how to do right now.
01:47:55.70 --> 01:47:58.70 He knows how to lead. And he's going to turn that organization around.

01:49:17.70 --> 01:49:20.70 Remember what it meant to people.
01:49:20.70 --> 01:49:29.70 And remember the will that it instilled in those people, a will so strong that they face death without fear.
01:49:29.70 --> 01:49:32.70 And then remember the will.
01:49:32.70 --> 01:49:40.70 The will that overcame that code was the will of freedom.
01:49:40.70 --> 01:49:47.70 The will that says, I will bow down to no man.
01:49:47.70 --> 01:49:58.70 The will to stand up no matter what kind of evil death code there was that attack and tried to enslave the world.
01:49:58.70 --> 01:50:08.70 That evil was overcome by the strength of freedom and the will to get up.
01:50:08.70 --> 01:50:15.70 And no matter what, get after it.
01:50:15.70 --> 01:50:41.70 And until next time, this is echo and jacco out.
