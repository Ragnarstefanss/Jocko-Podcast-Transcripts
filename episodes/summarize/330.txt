and so when I wrote the uh initial draft of this chapter the the thing that I felt like I had to convey was that uh uh the senior commanders in World War II they had uh they had a serious problem uh when it came to uh amphibious warfare one they didn't have landing craft uh but two even if they did have landing craft they didn't know uh the army's commanders they didn't know how to put troops ashore and there were uh there were logistics problems they they knew that they would need to even if they uh were able to land um men even if they were able to put landing craft on beaches uh they needed to put um men on beaches and which there were beach exits so exits so you could drive vehicles off the beach I mean if you land on a beach that has you know cliff faces and you can't drive off the beach then uh what good is it that you you know had all these landing craft you have to have uh guys that can find beaches good beaches uh and then alert the army out to where those beaches are so you know can bring an entire landing force ashore the army has completely um in the interwar period from World War I to World War II they've done almost nothing uh when it comes to the development of amphibious doctrine nothing showcased uh the threat of all of that more uh then uh the terrible disaster at D.A.P which happens in August of 1942 that's the first time uh the allies attempt to land um troops on an enemy beach or a Nazi controlled enemy beach now the proponents of troops in the battle are Canadians there's a decent amount of British commandos uh there's a handful of American army rainders um they go ashore uh most of the Canadians are killed or captured um and part of the reason that uh this raid or this assault or this attempted you know uh address rehearsal of D.A. fails is because they don't have a good assessment of um what the beach eggs it's were like they don't know how uh when they got ashore the tanks either um they weren't able to get off the beach because the sand was too uh too loose they couldn't their their their treads um buried up to the hubs they couldn't get out they couldn't get off the beach the tanks that or the tanks and the vehicles that were able to get off the beach they ran into tank traps almost immediately so um um the idea was you know creating you know writing this whole chapter on you know the deep raid was just you know uh away from you to talk about uh you know all the imperatives that a uh a scouting radar force would need to um um solve yeah bring to bring to the table they they didn't have any decontriction they get stopped by British uh shore but patrol boats uh thinking that they're a German boat you know trying to send uh raiders ashore um and when the and when the um uh the coast guard comes aboard their their vessel uh all the British commandos are drunk so not only they get shot off the beach they drank the entire boats like or supply there you go how about the devil's brigade how was that played to this uh whole scene the devil's brigade or um they were just one they were one of those uh units that I was really interested in and I really I was almost trying like looking for an excuse to to write about them they were um they were a unit that uh was a it was a joint um uh Canadian and American uh unit and it was the kind of the brainchild of Mount Baton um Marshall had by and uh it was supposed to be a unit that they dropped into Norway on uh like snowmobiles or our snow tractors um that would lead raids and ultimately became a pretty adequate um uh semi-commando force uh it was an air sort of sort of sort of ranger sort of airborne um and Robert Frederick's uh became the commander of it and he was uh as um as interesting as Darby uh you know this um uh had you know as equally a story uh career I think he was uh wounded something like nine times uh during the course of the war um uh and what was the how come the devil's brigade didn't sustain well I mean the army special forces when they are um when they are claiming uh their their forefathers they always point to the devil's brigade and I don't really I was hoping you'd ask about him you could write a book about Red Mike that's uh Red Mike Hudson he's uh so when I was trying to you know sort through the the relevance of the Raiders the Raiders are important to the history of the seal teams because uh they're the first instance where the navy telegraphs its desire for its own rating force uh they want to um broadcast or they want to um franchise raids throughout the Pacific to draw the Japanese attention away from the areas that they're about to attack so Japanese defenses are too consolidated they want to spread them out on all these islands so uh when before uh the invasion of Guadalcanau uh it was the navy's idea to pull the Japanese attention all the way to the central Pacific you know 2,000 miles north um so the idea is launch some submarine raiders on these things and uh you know like I said spread the spread Japanese attention spread Japanese defenses and I was looking when I knew that you know I knew that that's that was the goal and there were two uh Raider battalions that do it or that there were designed to do it the first Raider battalion and the second Raider battalion now I knew the second Raider battalion had taken making and that was probably more in keeping with uh the the point that I needed to make uh to launch pad into my second chapter what I didn't like was that I would have to spend so much time with Evans Carlson now if you read the book Evans Carlson is one of probably the three most peculiar characters in the book uh he's really frustrating um and you know you you if you're writing history you know the goal is always to be objective with characters you don't want to telegraph to your reader that you don't like somebody uh Evans Carlson is a as a person it's hard not to dislike merit uh red mic heads in on the other hand is uh he's incredible like you I mean he's um but they uh after the second night they realized they're not going to be able to have a link up and uh three swimmers get left behind and they are three they're the as far as I know they're the only three missing um well there's there's a couple of others but um they're three on accountant for and SW members out there we still have not recovered their bodies we think um based off of the research of one uh archivist at uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh the national archives uh who's also uh Moonlight says a historian himself named patch he's put together a pretty uh pretty convincing argument the the bodies are probably a bubble through app um they're buried with uh handful of other uh captured American aviators but we have not not found them there's an effort right now uh by project recover uh to try and track their bodies down i i expected that um writing history of the seal teams or writing how the navy had you know been the first to create this type of unit i always expected that it'd be tough to justify how i put the you know the army or a marine court chapters and it wouldn't be tough to you know justify the navy chapters the navy chapters would just sort of write themselves i just had to say what happened just say what happened i found the opposite to be true because you know it was you know what the army chapters and the marine court chapters all you really just you know trying to show like why these units failed or why they um why the you know they're uh senior leaders pulled the rug out from under them the navy chapters you're you're having to you know show how um you know a unit like the NCD use which is you know created just a solve one problem and that problem is the obstacles in France where the obstacles on the coast how did that why is that relevant you know to the ultimate creation of go anywhere so i um it took a long time and it took multiple draft before i realized that the point of this whole thing or the the relevance to that story is not so much um you know the fact that they were uh you know just blowing up obstacles it's the fact that they left such an impression on the navy leaders after that you know there's you know there's you know all these um you know episodes of of naval bravery you know there's the experience of the uh uh the the the the the the the destroyers that ultimately save the day that pushed the army ashore these destroyers you know they're um they're on the outskirts of uh of the battle until um Admiral Hall uh uh uh the army the army is looking at what's happening on on a mobile beach there's there's there's successful landings on gold sword but I thought just going through some of the chapter it's going through the chapters and talking about some of the things that didn't quite make it uh chapter one is called the reluct by the way I was thinking about this as I was putting this together chapter one is called the reluctant creation and violent demise of the Navy's first commandos the Marine Corps Raiders your subtitles for each chapter indicate that you have a lot to say and this is going to be a long book like chapter one the reluctant you know my books have like chapter one get some you know boom we're done right chapter two get more like I'm an idiot you're over here the reluctant creation and final demise of the Navy's first commandos the Marine Corps Raiders that was my editors that was Julian Pavilion he he sort of insisted so each of my chapters or something like I don't know like it wasn't it wasn't as tight as like Carlson's Raiders but it was something like the the only one that I remember is for chapter five from my unit days it was like the the Merum and before before they had come up with the frogmen is like a moniker for them they were calling them like the really clunky oh god that's awful especially after that move what's that movie echo Charles which one uh Zulander you know what I'm talking about so in the movie Zulander which has Owen Wilson in it who's like one of my favorite people all the time that guy seems so chill and cool 're they're training them they're putting them through you know little little PT sessions like uh they're they're doing log PT's they're doing like little like group activities they stuff that you know uh either Jean Toney had pulled from the Marine Corps or uh that they had kind of uh developed along the way themselves which you know that's kind of plant a seed for later when you know the scouts and raiders uh uh conditioning curriculum gets compressed by driver coffin uh but they all volunteer for this uh this commando program they don't really know what it is uh I mean and to have to write about Darby critically um that wasn't easy to do I had the um it was the first time that I had to write about somebody who you know I knew to be you know a legitimate American hero um and write about them you know in a you know an a light that's not flattering and I'm not sure that anybody's ever done that before I'd read a lot of books about Darby and every single one of them they you know has they burnish as legacy they they consider him you know to be one of the the the founders are one of the the the most important you know greatest um contributors to American special operation history and that's true but there's also this other truth that Darby should have known better and he didn't um and I don't know why I mean I thought I spent a lot of time thinking about it like nobody in the US Army knew better than Darby what a raid was and how a raid could be successful and what elements would have to be put together for that raid to fail and but uh some of it's his personality some of it just he's got he's kind of ponderous like uh he's been boring like you know stuffy like uh one of the the things that I think is most telling the most descriptive uh episode I have a little vignette and the book is one one of his junior officers comes up to him and asks him for you know a few books uh to read uh that will help him understand you know the you know how to command or the military art better and and all the books the Carlson recommends are books that he's written they you gotta think a lot of yourself to tell somebody you know if they're looking for books to read these five that have written so he tried to read them huh no I thought Pete Ellis of Pete Ellis is relevant because Pete Ellis is the he's the Marine he's a first world war Marine who is he's the first Marine to articulate a vision for the Marine Corps that is more than just a subordinate service to the US Navy or the Navy's police force he imagines after he sees what the Marine Corps capable of on the Western Front the Marine Corps is the when World War I starts and the US military finds itself in the trenches not just in the trenches but then moving on the German Army the best force that the United States military has is the Marine Corps so there's all these marine officers staff officers, Marine commanders who suddenly by comparison with their peers in the US Army see that the Marine Corps is the best service the most capable service you know that we have so why not you know start thinking beyond you know just this idea of being you know the ship or the ship born utility force for the US Navy why not start thinking of the US Marine Corps as almost a rival to the US Army so in order to do that in order to justify that in Congress the Marine Corps had to articulate a mission for itself and that mission was you know it was essentially come up with by Pete Ellis Pete Ellis he identifies the enemy or at least you know he's writing this in 1922 20 years before World War II starts he knows that the next war the US is in is going to be with Imperial Japan he knows how rapacious Japan is he knows their ambitions to dominate all of Asia and if the US military wants to confront Japan it's going to have to have a force capable of doing that a force that's not just you know like I said the ship born utility force of Raiders or jungle fighters anything like that they're going to have to have all the logistics capable of supporting an amphibious army ashore artillery aircraft logistics ships landing craft all that stuff I was going to force a reader to kind of discover uh buckloom's relevance you know instead of like compressing buckloom into that final uh chapter and you know on the buckloom report and really you know instead of you know spreading spreading out your tanks you know consoling into one punch so the reader finally gets a sense of how important this person is I just didn't want to waste buckloom you know throughout the book I wanted to you know collect him all one thing but it took me you know almost until the book was entirely written no and everybody thinks 100 yards off the beach is freaking close everybody walks away or everybody you know comes away from you know the reading of Omaha Beach as this um as this victory of uh American infantry over you know the German obstacles um and that's true but there's also another truth and that's the um uh that's the commitment or that's the force that the Navy brought to bear on that day and then and the army would not have gotten off those killing fields or other killing beaches without the contribution of the US Navy but what I found was the point of this chapter was that with all of that with all of the the the the the contribution that the Navy had made with all the bravery um the the Navy walks away from that battle uh with knowing that the the greatest contribution that they'd given that day was with the naval over with with the NCDUs with the naval combat demolition units um they are awarded you know some this six Navy crosses um more silver stars and you can check a stick at they've got they they award the NCDUs only one of three uh presidential unit citations that are awarded from uh a naval unit on Omaha Beach um I I don't know what the the disconnect is because I find myself like whenever whenever I'm being instructed now or like I'm I find myself like I get real like I can't listen to this guy I gotta get out of here I'll find myself just leaving I would have thought you would have gone down the sniper because you have this you know super anyone that's you know going into archives and reading Carlson's third book on whatever communist leadership from 1932 now I didn't want to read it though like I remember looking at that book and just kind of like hanging my head like I got to read another one of these things I don't know what I don't know why I was compelled to do it and I know because of Burke I know because of every you know other people you hi achievers like somebody like Burke he never slept yeah that that why that passage stood out to me and look I've got so many marks in this book now from the last time we did this and just from reading it but that that idea that here's this guy who's listening to a young ensin go down with his ship and he's thinking to himself you know after this guy says forgive me the mistakes I'm about to make and you know Arlie Burke sitting there thinking he could have taught him he could have given him a heads up he could have given whoever that commander was or the lieutenant commander or the lieutenant that was above this guy in the chain of command all these guys could he could have taught them something that maybe they wouldn't be in this situation and just knowing that every effort that you gave to pass on the lessons they failed and now this this guy is just young man just young ensin is dying and he's gonna go down with his ship with all these sailors on board and there's there's just all these lessons and and I mean there's so many times where when I was in the teams well good example is Mike Thornton you know Mike Thornton came on this podcast a couple years ago and we went moment by moment and debriefed the the operation where he for which he was awarded the the Medal of Honor and it's it's three hours it's like a three hour debrief and I was in the sealed teams with at the same time as Mike Thornton I knew Mike Thornton and they're protected by you know multiple battleships one being the USS Colorado and I'm like Colorado has lighted self up um a midships or uh uh uh with a broadside uh to the beach um and it takes devastating um uh nail gunfire uh shore gunfire um and the guns are knocked out and the suddenly uh all the swimmers of UDT7 are exposed and they're they're about to uh the Japanese are about to switch their guns away from the ships they're defending them two of the swimmers in the water now see more ons is the brother and law of Draper Coffman he sees what's happened he sees that the Colorado's guns have been knocked out and he commands his ship without orders he commands uh the Norman Scott to get between the Colorado so one the Colorado can escape and two so he can also protect uh the UDT swimmers that are in the water suddenly uh the USS Norman Scott becomes the center of all Japanese uh nail gunfire Juno there's successful landings at Utah beach everywhere the you know the you know the the you know the the landing to get troops ashore on dda is going well except here at Omaha Omaha you know the army commander's like i we might need to pull our troops off they might need to do something they've never trained to do which is a full scale evacuation in front of the enemy at Mohal who has um made it a point to make sure that he's in charge of the invasion until uh forces are firmly established ashore says no we're not doing that and he does what you know nobody has done up to that point which is push uh destroyers right up to the uh to the the as close to the coast as possibly pushes them 800 yards away uh from from the coast that's the same destroyers they they come in a flank speed and as soon as they get to about uh where their poles are about three feet off the bottom they all turn left I mean you see the you see the paralysis and you know like we talked about last time the paralysis and the letters between the two like he knows that the sun's going to be committed or sent on these you know terribly dangerous missions it's never been done before like when before draper coffin heads out with UDT5 to scout the beaches for a side pan his dad knows that these guys are going into combat with nothing and the letters are you know he signs them off you know just the same way you know anybody any any other dad would you know love you lots and lots of luck and that's all I can do like it's all I can do for you he's in fact we were with the chinese he thinks that these are uh uh you know members of the most you know one of the most civilized um you know uh countries on the planet um and he uh has a respect for them in a way that other america does don't um he he totally rejects uh the the orientalism or the uh the the superior american idea in that way he's he's just like you know teelorns i mean the i mean the emergency or i i can see a movie of you know these guys you know totally you know going into battle with just knives and you know fins and masks let me pretty need you have another character that you bring in here uh going to the book at 60 years old thick jowled and with white hair parted just off center wild build dawn event a nickname he had earned as a volunteer leading soldiers through mud gas and death on the western front looked in his uniform nothing like the head of an insatiable unconventional warfare organization and more like an overweight toddler playing dress up for signs of the former one had to look elsewhere first to his left breast where he had humbly affects a single ribbon his metal of honor in effect saying to his peers that no other awards mattered and second to a career as an attorney as a new York attorney and politician occupations that it introduced him to everyone from movie stars to Mussolini and taking him farther around the world than most presidents he had been to cyber it aside as a bolster vix to the far east a hunt down business Ethiopia to toward the Italian front the balklands turkey and Spain as a presidential presidents unofficial envoy in past ages a hero milionaire like donovan could have responded to a world crisis simply by raising his own regiment equipping it and leading it into battle in the 20th century such impulses had been curbed by the increasing complexities of modern warfare and a corresponding bureaucracy that recognized the limited value of eccentric amateurs metal of honor not now blocked from commanding regular troops donovan courageous entrepreneurial imaginative and most of all unstoppable had set his sights on the only field of action whose battle lines had not yet been drawn and on the one man who stood in his way what's up with donovan dude well it's an it's an impossible contest i mean donovan is when i when i set out to write this not this chapter but when i i i set out to write an OSS chapter and then he fights in successive battles the what's important about Carlson though is that the Marine Corps um loses all respect for him after the making island raid they give him another chance with the long patrol on Guadalcanal and he does admirable work there but it's not enough to overshadow uh the the defeat and the uh the aftermath of the making island raid the making island raid um it is really known how uh disaster disaster it is until 1943 a whole year later when uh U.S. forces retake the island and they discover that the um that the Marines that uh they believe to have been drowned uh in the uh evacuation weren't drowned but captured and killed it'd be headed by the Japanese um so it's sort of a uh sort of a uh a failure that kind of unfolds over time but when the the full scope of the failure the making island raid is understood um the Marine Corps never lets Evans Carlson command troops ever again now that's perfectly you know find for the Marine Corps leadership they was there something about his personality that is a personality right i'll match as any other tragedy or uh that NSW has experienced it's far far exceed anything it'll at least in any single day experience and this happens mostly in the space of of around three or four hours uh gap assault teams um three and fourteen eleven they're all destroyed even before i'm right eleven destroyed as soon as it's ramp drops three and fourteen or destroyed uh destroyed before the ramps even drop there they would mourn mortars and just about everybody and all of a board is killed um it's the it's the most important day of the 20th century i mean it's the day that determines um whether or not Hitler's going to be removed from the continent um and it's uh uh it's tough to you know write this chapter and not make it you know out China everything else it's a um it's too much the chapter was twice as long when i you know when i finished the first draft it was i yeah that was one of the um that's in August of 44 there's a series of sort of secret um reconnaissance so after the Tinian reconnaissance which draper coffin leads um it's a it's a combined reconnaissance between uh back recon so the marine recon and UDT swimmers um the navy really sees the potential of doing these night secret reconnaissance of various islands so the next group of islands that the uh uh specific planners are hoping to capture are in the pull out so pelaloo that whole episode in the war so one of the satellite islands of pelaloo is this island of YAP and uh so the USS Burfish with a contingent of UDT swimmers half of whom are uh not haven't really been trained in the traditional UDT curriculum which they established at Maui but um half of them are actually OSS maritime swimmers they send a combined uh recon team ashore at YAP uh three of the swimmers get separated from their boat the boat ends up paddling back to the uh the U.S. at Burfish which is the submarine uh they come back out the next night trying to recover uh the swimmers hoping that they've managed to stay alive ashore and not get captured um but it was the birthplace of you know kind of uh American special operations thinking everybody took a turn at four pierces anybody was gonna do any sort of amphibious training any special unit was going to take a stop at four pierces the raiders the uh uh the army raiders that you know you know uh one of the subwoofer on the Dallas they all everybody everybody took a turn through four pierces it was the um um it was the garden bed of uh uh uh of special operations thinking at the time it's it's a perfect uh table top island um but before it can be that it has to be taken and one of the the biggest coups of the war is Draper Coffman's reconnaissance of the of the beaches that uh nobody ever thought anybody could land on but in order to sell that in order to land all those troops on those uh beaches that nobody expects uh UDT7 has to stage this elaborate um ruse uh on the south of the island uh uh at Tenian town and so um on the day of the actual invasion when all the Marines are secretly sneaking into the uh the beaches of the Draper Coffman has found um the UDT7 is you know conducting a daylight you know reconnaissance like and he finally gets there I was on modern day self that had a sea and there are super clean and we're not worried about getting depth charges drop them your freaking head imagine it till we transit I can't go to a few all up in there and he gets there they get on the island and they look around and there's you know there's nothing really to raid I mean just the fact that they landed there the fact that they were able to assault the Japanese position and win mission accomplished get off the island there's nothing else that you have to do here there's no intelligence that you're really gonna gather but he he just he's paralyzed which just you know like I said it conveys that he doesn't know what he's doing he doesn't really know what the the purpose of this mission is he hasn't connected you know the navy's planners vision you know to their actions on on that island this Ensign I imagine this Ensign you know probably 22 years old like I just didn't know anything doesn't know anything about the world he hasn't heard you know stories you know like the one that you just read um but what he does have uh he has this uh he's been imprinted by the institution that he served him and by the people that are around him um and that's and then you go to point to Hawke you can't even look over the cliffs I mean you see where these rangers they climbed up like and then I mean the Germans at the top are cut and ropes and they're throwing grenades and they're leaning over the cliffs and they're machine gunning them off the ropes and still they came um and the the section that you read of uh karnowski uh he dropped his helmet in the water before you know the operation even started before the you know the um for the ramp even dropped he did not have a helmet and you you know spent a ran you know from you know
