00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 326 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willing. Good evening, echo.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Good evening.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Throughout October 30th and 31st, 2011, in furtherance of the Drug Enforcement Administration's

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Drug Law Enforcement Mission in Afghanistan, special agents of the DEA's Foreign Deployed Advisory Support

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.36
or Fast Team, conducted counter-narcotics, counter-insurgency operations with their police partners

6
00:00:31.36 --> 00:00:37.20
from the Afghan National Interdiction Unit assisted by the Australian Defense Forces.

7
00:00:37.20 --> 00:00:43.44
The task force departed their base via four helicopters as part of a mission to execute Afghan

8
00:00:43.44 --> 00:00:48.64
drug warrants and to search for narcotics, cashes, and heroin production labs.

9
00:00:48.64 --> 00:00:56.80
The team began to search the target area and accompanying opium bizarre when they began to receive

10
00:00:56.80 --> 00:01:04.08
sporadic incoming enemy fire. They accomplished their assigned duties and then maneuvered

11
00:01:04.08 --> 00:01:10.72
to the extraction location all-wall under sporadic enemy fire. When the task force arrived at the

12
00:01:10.72 --> 00:01:15.36
helicopter landing zones, they continued to receive effective enemy fire. One of the four

13
00:01:15.36 --> 00:01:20.88
helicopters forced to make an additional orbit and subsequently land in the vicinity of special

14
00:01:20.88 --> 00:01:29.20
agents, pierceante, Johnson, Vanderbilt, Harris, Stewart, Fisher, Portinga, and five members

15
00:01:29.20 --> 00:01:34.56
from the Australian Special Forces. This helicopter landed under fire.

16
00:01:36.56 --> 00:01:41.92
Special agent, Pursante, laid down suppressive fire, which enabled special agents to

17
00:01:41.92 --> 00:01:46.56
Stewart Harris and Fisher to board the helicopter. Once inside, special agents Stewart

18
00:01:46.56 --> 00:01:52.32
continued applying suppressive fire. Special agents Stewart directed an Afghan door gunner to initiate

19
00:01:52.32 --> 00:01:57.84
suppressive fire in an attempt to cover the remaining members of the team still outside the helicopter.

20
00:01:58.96 --> 00:02:04.48
Special agent Pursante was approximately 10 meters from the rear of the helicopter when he was hit by

21
00:02:04.48 --> 00:02:13.44
enemy fire. The round penetrated his ballistic helmet, entered above his right eye and exited

22
00:02:13.44 --> 00:02:18.64
above his left eye and he was immediately rendered unconscious and fell to the ground.

23
00:02:20.96 --> 00:02:26.08
Special agent Portinga positioned himself at the rear of the helicopter and continued laying down

24
00:02:26.08 --> 00:02:31.92
suppressive fire as special agent Pursante was being brought back into the helicopter.

25
00:02:31.92 --> 00:02:38.000
He instinctively put himself in harm's way and returned fire until all personnel were on board

26
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.08
the helicopter as the helicopter took off. Special agents Vanderbilt, Johnson, and Harris immediately

27
00:02:44.08 --> 00:02:49.76
rendered first aid to special agent Pursante and controlled his bleeding, maintained an open air

28
00:02:49.76 --> 00:02:56.48
way and stabilized him. Special agent Pursante was eventually transferred to the Veterans

29
00:02:56.48 --> 00:03:03.76
Affairs Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia for continued treatment and rehabilitation. The actions of

30
00:03:03.76 --> 00:03:11.28
all agents involved both before and following the shooting were very clearly heroic.

31
00:03:15.68 --> 00:03:22.40
And that right there was an excerpt from an article by the US Department of Justice

32
00:03:22.40 --> 00:03:31.92
who oversees the DEA and special agent Joseph Pursante survived that round to the head.

33
00:03:33.20 --> 00:03:40.000
He became the first ever member of the DEA to receive the secretary of defense metal for the

34
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.24
defense of freedom and also received the federal congressional badge of bravery.

35
00:03:46.24 --> 00:03:58.08
But that bullet did do significant damage most significantly. It rendered special agent Pursante blind.

36
00:03:59.84 --> 00:04:07.04
But he has continued to drive on to grow to teach and a certain credible example of

37
00:04:07.04 --> 00:04:14.56
perseverance for all of us and is an honor to have him here with us tonight to share some of his

38
00:04:14.56 --> 00:04:22.16
experiences and lessons learned. Joe, thanks for coming on man. You're quite welcome. First I want

39
00:04:22.16 --> 00:04:28.32
to say it's an honor to be part of this podcast and I was very flattered that you guys asked me to

40
00:04:28.32 --> 00:04:35.84
be on it. Well you're the first DEA guy we've got here. So you got another first under your belt now.

41
00:04:38.08 --> 00:04:41.60
But you didn't start off in the DEA. Let's let's like I like to go back to the beginning.

42
00:04:41.60 --> 00:04:47.76
Let's figure out where you came from. How you ended up being who you are. Born in Detroit, right?

43
00:04:48.32 --> 00:04:54.64
Yes. Actually grew up was born and raised in the city of Detroit. My dad was a police officer there.

44
00:04:55.36 --> 00:05:00.80
And at the time there was residency so we had to live in a city. I'm actually third generation

45
00:05:01.52 --> 00:05:07.04
law enforcement officer and my family. When you say there was residency, what do you mean by that?

46
00:05:07.04 --> 00:05:10.96
You had to live in the city. You had to live in the city to be a police officer in the city. Yes. Or any

47
00:05:10.96 --> 00:05:16.32
at the time any city workers? Wow. If you're a fire fighter or you know work for the city's

48
00:05:16.32 --> 00:05:20.64
sanitation and things like that, you had to live in the city. So we all kind of clustered and huddled

49
00:05:20.64 --> 00:05:27.76
in little areas. And your dad was a cop. His whole career that was what he did. Yes. Some people

50
00:05:27.76 --> 00:05:34.16
tired in Detroit 1990 then went on to work at the University of Michigan. Their police department

51
00:05:34.16 --> 00:05:40.40
eventually became chief of police there. Did you have aspirations of being a cop as well?

52
00:05:41.68 --> 00:05:46.88
Yes. You know growing up I always played team sports. It was fortunate enough to

53
00:05:47.44 --> 00:05:52.72
play college and football to smaller school and southern Michigan. And I always like that kind of team

54
00:05:52.72 --> 00:05:59.20
atmosphere. And my father he worked conspiracy in our comics for years and years in Detroit police

55
00:05:59.20 --> 00:06:06.40
department. And I just saw that kind of team environment team atmosphere and it kind of drew me to it.

56
00:06:07.20 --> 00:06:13.36
Even though my father never pushed me to go into law enforcement and actually I'm when I went away

57
00:06:13.36 --> 00:06:20.48
to college. My major at first was sports medicine. I wanted to be an athletic trainer and then

58
00:06:20.48 --> 00:06:25.04
the more I thought about him like you know what I really want to do this law enforcement thing.

59
00:06:25.04 --> 00:06:31.44
So I talked to my dad and he's like okay you know I support you and if you're going to do

60
00:06:31.44 --> 00:06:39.68
the law enforcement he worked on a DEA task force and a drug task force there and he says you know

61
00:06:39.68 --> 00:06:45.60
I would encourage you to go federal just because the pay is a little better you get to travel the

62
00:06:45.60 --> 00:06:52.64
world and you get to see and do a lot of things and I've always been a kind of rough tumble person

63
00:06:52.64 --> 00:06:58.64
and DEA has always been known as the kind of blue collar, federal law enforcement. So he kind of

64
00:06:58.64 --> 00:07:04.64
tried to push me that way and he had friends that still worked there. But unfortunately when I

65
00:07:04.64 --> 00:07:12.48
graduated from college in December of 91 DEA was on a hiring freeze. So I went back home to the

66
00:07:12.48 --> 00:07:19.84
Detroit Michigan area and Detroit police was hiring so I put my application there and got hired

67
00:07:19.84 --> 00:07:27.28
by the Detroit police department and February of 1993. Now when you say you are a rough and tumble

68
00:07:27.28 --> 00:07:33.12
kid it to me it seems like when I talked to people that had police's parents they they're either like

69
00:07:33.12 --> 00:07:38.08
really good on the straight narrow and they kind of rebellious. Where were you at were you

70
00:07:38.08 --> 00:07:44.16
somewhere in the middle? You know I kind of had a rebellious street to me but luckily I had a strong

71
00:07:44.16 --> 00:07:52.56
father and a strong grandfather and kind of kept me on the straight in narrow and my father was pretty

72
00:07:52.56 --> 00:07:59.04
tough on me and but he always supported me. He always went to my athletic events. It was there all the

73
00:07:59.04 --> 00:08:06.96
time. You know we put a foot up my ass if I needed but also you know was very loving and supporting

74
00:08:06.96 --> 00:08:12.000
you know I could still call my father today hey dad I need help he's like okay I'm on the way and

75
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.76
a little more background my dad's father and actually my mother's father they both served and

76
00:08:19.76 --> 00:08:27.52
we'll work too and my dad's father he actually landed an Omaha Beach on D-Day and the second way

77
00:08:27.52 --> 00:08:35.28
even later got a silver star pushing through Germany. When you did you have brothers and sisters I

78
00:08:35.28 --> 00:08:41.12
have one sister she's four years younger than me but you were kind of the only son so your dad was

79
00:08:41.12 --> 00:08:48.48
at every sporting event that there was. Oh yes it coached me every sport but football

80
00:08:49.60 --> 00:08:57.60
so but to always even at grade school he would video of my games at the old VHS video camera

81
00:08:57.60 --> 00:09:03.52
and we sit down and watch the games after with him and he'd like you know Joey you know they called me

82
00:09:03.52 --> 00:09:08.48
he had my name is Joe too and my both grandfathers were Joe so they called me Joey. Joey you did

83
00:09:08.48 --> 00:09:14.88
this wrong you didn't have my mom would be like leave that poor kid alone. Where you how were you

84
00:09:14.88 --> 00:09:19.28
in school? Where you did you feel like you had to do good in school because your dad was kind of

85
00:09:19.28 --> 00:09:24.48
keeping an eye on you. Yeah you know I felt you know I needed to do you know well in school

86
00:09:27.76 --> 00:09:35.60
school things I would say I have you know I know what you're trying to say. Yeah you know

87
00:09:35.60 --> 00:09:41.20
I'm a pretty athletic guy but I've always had to work working life for things you know I was taught

88
00:09:41.20 --> 00:09:48.000
you work hard you put the effort in and if you didn't succeed at something you go back and look at it

89
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.36
and you kind of become kind of analyze yourself okay what did I do right what did I do wrong

90
00:09:53.36 --> 00:10:01.36
what can I do better I've had a good example to you know put hard work in you know and most often

91
00:10:01.36 --> 00:10:07.52
hopefully it's gonna pay off and I just had a good example that way and you played you played

92
00:10:07.52 --> 00:10:14.24
college football as well yes and you how was that how was that did you guys went a lot did you

93
00:10:14.24 --> 00:10:18.64
lose a lot well lessons you take away from playing college ball you know I tell you what I tell

94
00:10:18.64 --> 00:10:25.36
everybody sports teach us a lot of lessons in life teaches you how to win how to lose how to be a

95
00:10:25.36 --> 00:10:34.56
team player all those things and I learned valuable lessons from sports now in college I went to a

96
00:10:34.56 --> 00:10:39.52
small school and so the mission called Adrian College we were the most winningest football team in

97
00:10:39.52 --> 00:10:49.92
Michigan in the 80s all divisions so we did really well when I was there we won two league championships

98
00:10:49.92 --> 00:10:57.84
and actually went to division three college national playoffs in 1988 so it was a good you know I

99
00:10:57.84 --> 00:11:06.64
was able to get my education and I excelled in college in football I knew I wasn't going to be the

100
00:11:06.64 --> 00:11:11.92
tallest guy you know bless my mom she's only like five foot so I better be strong and fast so

101
00:11:11.92 --> 00:11:20.24
lesson I picked up the weights and kind of blew up as soon as I started lifting so in college I was

102
00:11:20.24 --> 00:11:28.88
an all league player twice I was team captain team MVP and our league we had every week they

103
00:11:28.88 --> 00:11:34.08
listed an offensive defensive player the week I made that defensive player the week numerous times

104
00:11:34.08 --> 00:11:38.40
so you know it was a good experience you know you get to get the bond with those you know the

105
00:11:38.40 --> 00:11:44.48
people you play with and you learn life lessons and actually in college you know you finally get to

106
00:11:44.48 --> 00:11:48.56
do think you know classes that you're interested in your major and I did really well in college

107
00:11:48.56 --> 00:11:54.40
and actually and my major I had over three point average and stuff so and you said you transfer

108
00:11:54.40 --> 00:12:01.92
you switched from being and want to become like an athletic trainer into what sociology criminal

109
00:12:01.92 --> 00:12:06.88
justice what so you made the decision having to go go be a cop or something like that after

110
00:12:06.88 --> 00:12:15.12
my freshman year at the time at our school we didn't have a just specific criminal justice program

111
00:12:15.12 --> 00:12:20.88
so it was sociology with the emphasis on criminal justice and I continued sports and medicine

112
00:12:20.88 --> 00:12:28.72
as my minor degree so then you get done with that the federal the DA's not hiring as you said

113
00:12:28.72 --> 00:12:35.84
and so now you decide you're going to go and become a Detroit cop yes is it hard to apply for

114
00:12:35.84 --> 00:12:40.48
how strict is it it was easy to get into did you third generation you just get like a welcome

115
00:12:40.48 --> 00:12:44.96
map at the front door to get in there I wouldn't say that but when I showed to recruit or you know

116
00:12:44.96 --> 00:12:49.12
it was like you know they didn't give me any cut me any slack at all you know you got to go take

117
00:12:49.12 --> 00:12:53.68
your little eye test and this and that and you know you go through the process of course it's not

118
00:12:53.68 --> 00:13:01.28
is intense and his details of process getting hard federally busy you have to get security

119
00:13:01.28 --> 00:13:07.52
clearance you know but I you know they do a good job and you know I had decent credentials

120
00:13:07.52 --> 00:13:14.08
and you know luckily I just didn't get in a lot of trouble or didn't get caught so I didn't have

121
00:13:14.08 --> 00:13:20.96
bad things on my record so you know I got in fairly easy and showed up there and went through

122
00:13:20.96 --> 00:13:27.28
the academy and I'm not only like kind of a muscle head guy but I'm fairly intelligent and I

123
00:13:27.28 --> 00:13:31.84
graduated top academically in my class and got just lamp on knowledge and plaque and stuff

124
00:13:31.84 --> 00:13:41.12
a little genie lamp on there you know I say there's no great shakes you know my I guess my

125
00:13:41.12 --> 00:13:47.36
competition there wasn't as as a greatest level as the DEA academics but it was pretty good you

126
00:13:47.36 --> 00:13:53.36
know you get to teach a lot of a lot of things and in Detroit I grew up there on my life so I

127
00:13:53.36 --> 00:13:58.08
kind of knew when I was getting into and Detroit on the police department is kind of a bat

128
00:13:58.08 --> 00:14:04.32
tip of my fire you get to learn how to be the real police real fast you know it's kind of

129
00:14:04.32 --> 00:14:09.60
sink or swim and you immediately just go right out being like a beat cop in the streets and where

130
00:14:09.60 --> 00:14:17.12
with they did is they took the top people out of our class and put us in this unit called

131
00:14:17.12 --> 00:14:28.000
tactical service section we were a citywide unit that did crowd control also if there was a

132
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.44
bearer-fated gun person we would do outer perimeter and we would work in areas where they were

133
00:14:35.44 --> 00:14:41.28
having problems certain precincts or the precincts got overrun with calls and we would go

134
00:14:41.28 --> 00:14:50.56
in flood the area and help the precincts out so it was kind of like a QRF like a quick reaction

135
00:14:50.56 --> 00:14:57.76
for us kind of like that in a way you know but you know we just answered the priority one

136
00:14:57.76 --> 00:15:02.96
in two calls like the shots fired things like that robberies and progress we took a little

137
00:15:02.96 --> 00:15:09.20
those higher level calls so it was pretty crazy and Detroit's kind of weird animal like I

138
00:15:09.20 --> 00:15:16.72
grew up in the east side so I mostly was the east side guy and when I became a TSS we worked the

139
00:15:16.72 --> 00:15:21.04
whole cities you might be in a couple different areas a couple different precincts as they call it

140
00:15:21.04 --> 00:15:26.16
in one day so when I grew up if I got out and chased somebody and jumped a couple of fences I knew

141
00:15:26.16 --> 00:15:32.88
where the hell I was you know beyond the west side bail out and I was pretty fast and I could jump

142
00:15:32.88 --> 00:15:37.92
fences pretty good so I could usually catch a lot of people and I was in shape so I jumped a

143
00:15:37.92 --> 00:15:44.48
couple fences I'd be in a yard holding a suspect at gunpoint and I wouldn't know where the hell I was

144
00:15:44.48 --> 00:15:50.40
at I'd be like radio, tech three I'm a couple blocks east of my original location

145
00:15:51.84 --> 00:15:56.48
next to the burnedout garage but the problem was like every third garage is burned out so

146
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.88
so that was the day to day so you did that right out of the academy that seems like a strange

147
00:16:04.88 --> 00:16:09.12
thing to take someone that's brand new and put them in that kind of situation we're going into

148
00:16:09.12 --> 00:16:15.04
these tough calls all the time out of the gate that's trial by fire oh yes but which was good

149
00:16:15.04 --> 00:16:20.80
is a lot of the better officers worked there at tactical service section so you got to be trained

150
00:16:20.80 --> 00:16:26.32
and learned from some of the better police officers so you know you really got to learn the job

151
00:16:26.32 --> 00:16:32.000
fast and from some good individuals like how many people were on the team did you guys show up

152
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.08
in like a freaking armored trucker we well each shift we had we ran two shifts a day shift

153
00:16:38.64 --> 00:16:42.96
and then a power shift the power shift was seven unlike the three in the morning those are like

154
00:16:42.96 --> 00:16:50.16
the busiest times day shift and power shifts so we've rolled out to eight to ten cars okay

155
00:16:50.16 --> 00:16:55.84
two people in a car you know so we would flood an area so it was good if you needed back up you

156
00:16:55.84 --> 00:17:04.32
needed help you know somebody usually was there fairly fast but it was it was intense and then

157
00:17:04.32 --> 00:17:12.08
after at the time my dad finished up he was on the full-time swatime in Detroit and was crazy

158
00:17:12.08 --> 00:17:18.88
about Detroit being a big city they didn't have a full-time swatime until 1986 which to me kind of

159
00:17:18.88 --> 00:17:24.32
blows my mind yeah that's crazy and he was on he was one of the original members on the team and then

160
00:17:24.32 --> 00:17:30.56
after three years of working up a troll type unit you could apply for a special unit or bureau

161
00:17:31.68 --> 00:17:39.36
they call them also and I tried out for the swat team and later made the swat team in my last year

162
00:17:39.36 --> 00:17:45.76
and the job I was on the full-time tactical team which was you know pretty pretty intense you

163
00:17:45.76 --> 00:17:50.40
got to do a lot of fun stuff and you didn't have to do a lot of paperwork but usually the

164
00:17:50.40 --> 00:17:55.36
sergeant the team you know he did the right up after the barricade gun person or unless you got

165
00:17:55.36 --> 00:18:00.72
into of course a shooting you would have to do a report and so so you went right from that

166
00:18:00.72 --> 00:18:06.96
tactical service section into the swat team yes how many years did you did you do the the

167
00:18:06.96 --> 00:18:11.12
tactical service section three years and then one year on the full-time swat team and then

168
00:18:11.12 --> 00:18:16.000
yes you did you shoot any did you fire your shot fire your weapon at all during those three years

169
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:24.16
with the tactical service and not with TSS but on the swat team and it took a while to get hired by

170
00:18:24.16 --> 00:18:31.28
D.E.A. you know government sometimes it's hurry up and wait and I was sitting around it didn't

171
00:18:31.28 --> 00:18:37.28
hear anything that I had failed something and have time went by months went by and I get a call

172
00:18:37.28 --> 00:18:42.08
then they're like Mr. Perceini you still interested in a job but D.E.A. I said of course I have

173
00:18:42.08 --> 00:18:49.20
yeah we had lost your application we found it now oh man I'm like this has every information about me you know

174
00:18:49.20 --> 00:18:56.80
parents siblings every neighbor I've ever had you know I've had and the the process kind of

175
00:18:56.80 --> 00:19:04.64
really sped up so I'm like three months out from the academy and we go to a barricaded gunman

176
00:19:04.64 --> 00:19:12.000
and one of the precincts and Detroit and it's an ex-military person they have kind of mental problems

177
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:20.16
and they would hold the neighborhood and their family at bay of shooting at them every so often so

178
00:19:20.16 --> 00:19:26.40
we respond and we begin take over from the precinct began negotiating with them and

179
00:19:27.20 --> 00:19:31.12
they start shooting at our armor personnel carrier through the window and

180
00:19:31.12 --> 00:19:40.000
it's starting to ramp up and we had some officer stationed in the backyard and the person goes out

181
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.84
and is you know exchanging shooting at them but they don't have a clear shot at the suspect

182
00:19:46.48 --> 00:19:52.88
and they had a car in the driveway and my team was on a break we were like four or five houses

183
00:19:52.88 --> 00:20:00.72
down between houses and we had one of the suburbans we had with us and we had like half our gear on

184
00:20:00.72 --> 00:20:05.04
and they're like do not let them get mobile we feel they're trying they're going to

185
00:20:05.04 --> 00:20:12.72
might try to go for the car and then sure is crap they go for the car so I jumped in the passenger

186
00:20:12.72 --> 00:20:16.24
side of the suburban my buddy drives it jumps in the driver seat for like half dressed

187
00:20:17.04 --> 00:20:23.68
we just got our MP5 submachine gun strapped around us so we pulled behind the car to try to

188
00:20:23.68 --> 00:20:30.72
block him in and they start to ram us and we're like oh crap and by this time it was dark and then I see a

189
00:20:30.72 --> 00:20:36.96
muzzle flash through the rear window and they start shooting at us so I

190
00:20:38.80 --> 00:20:45.36
exited the vehicle tactically and my partner did and we opened up into the car and unfortunately had to

191
00:20:46.56 --> 00:20:51.76
dispatch the person and I was like wait and all this time for DEA and then finally I get an

192
00:20:51.76 --> 00:20:55.76
shooting but thank you know thank god it was a good shooting I didn't you know there was no drama

193
00:20:55.76 --> 00:20:59.84
with that but I was just like just my luck you know wait all this time and then I get in this

194
00:20:59.84 --> 00:21:09.44
you know critical incident how often were you guys as a SWAT team doing hits you know it varied

195
00:21:09.44 --> 00:21:16.000
sometimes in a month we four or five times we may be a barricade a gun person sometimes we

196
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.72
would serve like felony warrants for more dangerous individuals once in a while we go out with

197
00:21:22.72 --> 00:21:28.72
narcotics if they were hitting a spot which they deemed was pretty dangerous and needed a little

198
00:21:28.72 --> 00:21:34.64
more trained units so we'd go and do that but you know did a lot of training tactical training a

199
00:21:34.64 --> 00:21:39.36
lot of shooting you know and as you can attest to the more you shoot the more efficient you know it's

200
00:21:39.36 --> 00:21:44.72
kind of a perishable skill so you know we got to do all those type of things so it was it was a good

201
00:21:44.72 --> 00:21:56.80
experience and you were just sporting that 1990s MP5 yes 9mm yeah I was like oh yeah you're in a vehicle

202
00:21:56.80 --> 00:22:03.44
and you have an MP5 and you know in the 90s for me in the SEAL teams you know we used the MP5

203
00:22:03.44 --> 00:22:08.24
but we thought it was cool until we had to shoot somebody that was more than you know 50 yards away

204
00:22:08.24 --> 00:22:12.56
and all of a sudden you think this is not a good weapon to have no or they have a ballistic vest

205
00:22:12.56 --> 00:22:19.28
the place is not going to hit yeah you know in the apillar and cars will stop that 9mm too yeah yeah

206
00:22:19.28 --> 00:22:27.36
that's I guess we've all transitioned away from the the MP5 now but damn that's an accurate easy to shoot

207
00:22:27.36 --> 00:22:33.12
weapon I think that's like sometimes people ask me about home defense weapons like for like for a

208
00:22:33.12 --> 00:22:38.64
female maybe and I think man an MP5 is not a bad call you're in the house you're only going to shoot

209
00:22:38.64 --> 00:22:44.40
someone that's in the house most likely you know so I think it's and it's so easy to shoot so accurate

210
00:22:44.40 --> 00:22:49.28
yes we you know you know there's very very little to almost no recoil on that weapon yeah

211
00:22:49.28 --> 00:22:57.36
and with a suppressor on them it's nothing nothing but that's a lot of experience that you had

212
00:22:57.92 --> 00:23:03.20
I mean just doing hits all the time in the 90s just that kind of experience I remember from

213
00:23:03.20 --> 00:23:08.48
the SEAL perspective in the 90s you know we looked at SWAT team especially you know city

214
00:23:08.48 --> 00:23:13.84
big urban center SWAT teams you guys were doing you guys were doing war call the time so the

215
00:23:13.84 --> 00:23:20.56
experience that you all had and and you know we would work with LA SWAT from time to time seals would

216
00:23:20.56 --> 00:23:28.32
work with LA SWAT and it was we were kind of who we were kind of envious of the fact that they

217
00:23:28.32 --> 00:23:34.32
got to go out and do the job and and you know same thing for you up there and Detroit in the 90s

218
00:23:34.32 --> 00:23:39.04
you just if you're in the military in the 90s chances were you weren't doing anything real yeah no so

219
00:23:40.24 --> 00:23:47.68
you get in that experience is that's a lot of experience to have in the 90s from that perspective

220
00:23:49.12 --> 00:23:54.88
so meanwhile you get done with that you spend that this year so how long were you on SWAT team for

221
00:23:55.52 --> 00:24:00.80
about a year year on the SWAT team and that's and you got picked up for the DEA after three months

222
00:24:00.80 --> 00:24:06.16
of being at the SWAT team is that what you said no I was there a little longer but it just took

223
00:24:06.16 --> 00:24:11.60
I got in that fatal shooting right three months before I was ready to start my academy day to

224
00:24:11.60 --> 00:24:19.44
order for the academy I I got hired with DEA in June of 1997 and and this was you like the DEA

225
00:24:19.44 --> 00:24:25.04
because they're and I actually never heard that the DEA was the blue collar of the feds I liked that

226
00:24:25.04 --> 00:24:30.96
I didn't know that before that's the reputation that they have on at the time you know things

227
00:24:30.96 --> 00:24:36.24
that things are changing and law enforcement now and everything and but at the time we were kind

228
00:24:36.24 --> 00:24:44.88
of the roughnecks so to speak so you get you get to go to what is it they have the DEA academy

229
00:24:44.88 --> 00:24:51.12
is that what they have yes it's in it was in in Quantico Virginia inside the Quantico military base

230
00:24:51.12 --> 00:25:00.56
and when I went through us in the FBI shared the same academy we since have our own academy

231
00:25:00.56 --> 00:25:08.96
that's right next to the FBI academy but we still share the gun ranges and driving track

232
00:25:08.96 --> 00:25:16.88
in gym with the FBI and how long is that pipeline you know it's like um like 16 18 week

233
00:25:16.88 --> 00:25:24.000
academy and what are you doing is it legal is it physical is it what are you doing it's a little bit

234
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:32.32
of everything um where the police academy was more paramilitary DEA was more gentleman academy

235
00:25:32.32 --> 00:25:35.68
you know you didn't have to line up for inspection every day I see a speck will win down

236
00:25:35.68 --> 00:25:39.84
your you know you're uniform and getting you know the front lean and rest position and all that jazz

237
00:25:39.84 --> 00:25:47.84
um but it was very intense very academically challenging very physically challenge challenging

238
00:25:47.84 --> 00:25:57.12
we did a lot of shooting a lot of tactical training a lot of scenarios I was very impressed

239
00:25:57.12 --> 00:26:01.76
with it the biggest thing was your way from your family for four months as opposed when I

240
00:26:01.76 --> 00:26:07.36
went to the Detroit police academy he wasn't an overnight thing you come and go and stuff but

241
00:26:07.36 --> 00:26:16.56
it was a very very intense academy and then when I went through the DEA you couldn't go back

242
00:26:16.56 --> 00:26:22.08
to where you were hired from they had this thing with our administrator who's the person who runs DEA

243
00:26:23.52 --> 00:26:30.08
you couldn't go back because there might be a potential for corruption and to me and my if you're

244
00:26:30.08 --> 00:26:38.000
going to be cropped you're going to be cropped wherever you go through this so uh we you know

245
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.68
three quarters of the academy they put a list out and a different spots opened and you know

246
00:26:43.68 --> 00:26:49.12
say you got 50 individuals in your academy class and there's 50 spots and of course it's where

247
00:26:49.12 --> 00:26:53.60
individuals are needed and of course DEA what the drugs come up for Mexico a lot of border spots

248
00:26:54.40 --> 00:26:58.16
so I'm like well I don't speak Spanish so maybe I won't have to go there

249
00:26:58.16 --> 00:27:05.04
um a lot of spots in your Calais you know big cities like that and you get to pick your

250
00:27:05.04 --> 00:27:10.96
top three choices you're not guaranteed necessarily to get any one of those and you can work

251
00:27:10.96 --> 00:27:15.28
it out with the class you know you get to sit there beforehand and okay there's so many spots

252
00:27:15.28 --> 00:27:19.92
here who wants to put in for one of these spots and you can kind of work it out and you submit

253
00:27:19.92 --> 00:27:25.36
your top three and like I said you're not guaranteed to get them any little spots and if you

254
00:27:25.36 --> 00:27:29.68
speak Spanish and there's some border spots you're probably going to go to the border and

255
00:27:30.56 --> 00:27:36.56
hi um so what'd you put for your top three slots that you wanted? I put Phoenix Arizona

256
00:27:37.28 --> 00:27:42.80
number one I had never been to Phoenix but was going to have to move and I was married at the time

257
00:27:42.80 --> 00:27:48.32
and my wife had had the time had dual custody with her children as a two boys young boys

258
00:27:49.12 --> 00:27:53.76
and she's going to have to move away from them so I kind of let her pick and then I put

259
00:27:53.76 --> 00:28:00.48
some Fort Lauderdale in Miami I was I had being from Michigan I had a lot of family that lived

260
00:28:01.20 --> 00:28:06.64
vacation seasonally and Florida and the winter months but I also had a grandmother

261
00:28:07.28 --> 00:28:13.76
that had a place in Arizona and then my wife at the time had a grandfather that lived there so

262
00:28:14.40 --> 00:28:20.88
put in for Phoenix Arizona and as long as you weren't like a butt head in the sedan and you

263
00:28:20.88 --> 00:28:27.36
know you more or less got one of your top three spots so I was very fortunate and that so I got that

264
00:28:27.92 --> 00:28:34.88
selected and got Phoenix and then what did you do when you show up you're a new guy or you new guy

265
00:28:34.88 --> 00:28:40.48
they call you new guy what are they calling you? Oh yeah I know you know f and new guy you know all kind of stuff

266
00:28:40.48 --> 00:28:47.28
you know and so I find out that I'm going to show up there I'm going to the

267
00:28:47.28 --> 00:28:53.28
clandestine laboratory task force group we're going to be doing moth labs now from Detroit

268
00:28:53.28 --> 00:28:59.44
I've never seen method in fedamine one time really um but this not really an urban city drug

269
00:29:01.68 --> 00:29:06.80
mess kind of more of a white trash drug we're saying you know in the city you know you have heroin

270
00:29:07.20 --> 00:29:14.24
or they call it a city heroin and of course cocaine crack cocaine marijuana and things like that

271
00:29:14.24 --> 00:29:17.52
so I just leave the academy and they're like Joe you're going back to the academy of for

272
00:29:17.52 --> 00:29:25.12
clan labs go on my gosh yet so I got stuck in the the clan lab group for my first four years but it

273
00:29:25.12 --> 00:29:30.88
was kind of good because it was a local task force ran out of the the Maricopa County Sheriff's office

274
00:29:32.16 --> 00:29:38.88
and you got to learn the basics of necotics and the investigations how to write a search

275
00:29:38.88 --> 00:29:45.92
warns how to deal with informants which is kind of our bread and butter and you get to learn

276
00:29:45.92 --> 00:29:56.56
the job so it really taught me how to become a DEA investigator and I would say on the low end

277
00:29:56.56 --> 00:30:02.16
of the estimate I've been in at least 500 method in fedamine labs and we you know we were on

278
00:30:02.16 --> 00:30:05.84
all the protective gear in it but we really don't know what the long term exposure is to

279
00:30:05.84 --> 00:30:18.32
the all these costic and hazardous chemicals are I had a neighbor who's nephew got involved in

280
00:30:18.32 --> 00:30:26.24
meth and he told he had been to prison and he got out of prison and when I met him the nephew had

281
00:30:26.24 --> 00:30:31.76
gotten out of prison and I met him and was talking to him and he was yeah I was I was just got out of

282
00:30:31.76 --> 00:30:39.04
prison he said and he told me he said when I tried crystal meth for the first time as soon as I tried it

283
00:30:39.04 --> 00:30:43.52
I realized that with the only thing I ever wanted to do for the rest of my life was more crystal meth

284
00:30:43.52 --> 00:30:49.12
and he stole everything from his mom everything else for grandma everything from his uncle

285
00:30:49.12 --> 00:30:54.72
everything from all of his friends ruined every relationship in San Diego and then

286
00:30:55.36 --> 00:30:59.52
went to somewhere else San Bernardino and made friends there and stole from all them and then did

287
00:30:59.52 --> 00:31:04.24
that all across the country until he finally wound up in Texas and you know that's where he finally

288
00:31:04.24 --> 00:31:09.76
got rolled up and sent to prison but that that that meth thing is freaking crazy huh you know it's

289
00:31:09.76 --> 00:31:14.72
crazy you know you know these drugs are crazy especially these harder drugs like as you kind of said

290
00:31:14.72 --> 00:31:20.000
he controls their whole life you know and most of the labs are smaller we call them mom and pop

291
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.92
labs are cooking ounces that's cute you know you know it's you know it's they make enough to get

292
00:31:25.92 --> 00:31:32.56
their own for free and you know and sell a little bit to their friends you know so they get there

293
00:31:32.56 --> 00:31:38.48
as for free and you know they're cooking in these houses with these little kids you know and everything

294
00:31:38.48 --> 00:31:44.000
is off-gassing into the you know into the air getting into the carpet and walls and everything else

295
00:31:44.64 --> 00:31:49.68
so we started bringing child protective services with us when we would do meth and fedamine

296
00:31:49.68 --> 00:31:56.64
lab warrants and they would bring the kids to the hospital and when they would test them you know

297
00:31:56.64 --> 00:32:01.28
high percentage of what test positive for meth and fedamine just because the staff you know

298
00:32:01.28 --> 00:32:07.36
was in the carpet and the atmosphere you know it just breaks my heart you know me having a daughter

299
00:32:07.36 --> 00:32:12.56
you know these little kids involved and then not only would they get charged with the meth lab

300
00:32:12.56 --> 00:32:19.12
and manufacturing they would get charged with child abuse from CPS also so you would do these

301
00:32:19.12 --> 00:32:25.68
investigations you're you're getting human intelligence that's telling you hey I get my I get my

302
00:32:25.68 --> 00:32:30.08
meth from this person over here then you find out where that person lives then you track them for a

303
00:32:30.08 --> 00:32:35.28
little while figure out you know where they're doing suspicious activity and then you do a hit on it

304
00:32:35.28 --> 00:32:41.04
how does that work yes that's one of the means with an informant hey you know you know

305
00:32:41.04 --> 00:32:44.88
informants you know summer will try to work off charge a summer just paid informants and they go

306
00:32:44.88 --> 00:32:49.76
around and that's what they do you know so-and-so is manufacturing meth here you know I've saw

307
00:32:50.32 --> 00:32:56.16
you know these class where items I saw this part of the cooking procedure I saw these chemicals

308
00:32:56.80 --> 00:33:01.76
you know and then you do you know some more background and then you do you know some investigations

309
00:33:01.76 --> 00:33:09.12
of aliens and use kind of some of our techniques that we use to you know kind of make sure and

310
00:33:09.12 --> 00:33:16.08
evaluate the informant and we also get information from different places as well these chemicals you know

311
00:33:16.08 --> 00:33:20.24
Joe blow is buying you know keeps buying you know every month so many pounds of red phosphorus so

312
00:33:20.24 --> 00:33:26.48
we found the eyedine crystals or the different stores when you get by the coal pills the

313
00:33:26.48 --> 00:33:32.16
pseudo-faggender or a faggender tablets over the counter they would kind of some stores would work with us

314
00:33:32.16 --> 00:33:39.76
and they would get license plates so we do a work-up and you know find out where these people live

315
00:33:39.76 --> 00:33:45.92
they'll start an investigation and then we got enough probable cause for a search warrant we would hit

316
00:33:45.92 --> 00:33:52.40
these locations you know because of the the dangers of meth labs a lot of times you don't know

317
00:33:52.40 --> 00:33:57.44
what the atmosphere was so you when you rated it you would have to go in with full

318
00:33:57.44 --> 00:34:03.36
SCBA self-contained breathing apparatus but you didn't know with the environment in oxygen level was in

319
00:34:03.36 --> 00:34:09.52
the houses and of course you got this big tank on your back and it's kind of cumbersome and a lot

320
00:34:09.52 --> 00:34:16.96
of local swathes where clan lab trained for tactics so there were little smaller tactical

321
00:34:16.96 --> 00:34:23.12
bottles you could use so a lot of unknowns and you know one of our investigative techniques you

322
00:34:23.12 --> 00:34:29.28
go through and garbage cans when they put it on the curb so a lot of these meth people

323
00:34:29.28 --> 00:34:34.80
to know that we would pull trash so they would save every bit of lab trash they ever had in one room

324
00:34:35.60 --> 00:34:40.56
so you're missing you know your missing mixing acids and bay bases together and things are off-cass

325
00:34:40.56 --> 00:34:47.44
and so it's not the very safe environment to say the least. What's the paid informant?

326
00:34:47.44 --> 00:34:55.36
um they're actually there's almost like a professional informant but it's like for money

327
00:34:55.36 --> 00:35:02.56
seizure and drug seizures we would pay them money so they'd go around and work and travel

328
00:35:02.56 --> 00:35:08.88
sometimes from city to city just to make money as an informant you know and at different times when

329
00:35:08.88 --> 00:35:15.36
you know budgets and we had good money and you know they got a certain percentage of a cash seizure

330
00:35:15.36 --> 00:35:20.24
or acid seizure you know they can make some fairly decent money and what these are just guys

331
00:35:20.24 --> 00:35:26.40
sort of off the street or do they apply for that job or it's really you know you have to fill

332
00:35:26.40 --> 00:35:31.28
a lot of package for a person that wants to be a confidential source of course you have to run

333
00:35:31.28 --> 00:35:36.88
their criminal history make sure they have no act of warrants and you know you have to

334
00:35:37.76 --> 00:35:44.80
supervise them pretty tight and you know some people get improved for work as informant some

335
00:35:44.80 --> 00:35:50.40
don't just because they're a criminal history and their stuff is just so bad you know so it's

336
00:35:51.28 --> 00:35:56.80
you know it's a catch-22 you know you can't get a choir choir person a choir boy you know

337
00:35:56.80 --> 00:36:01.52
to catch people but it's it's a fine line you have you have to manage it well

338
00:36:02.80 --> 00:36:09.28
and as you're doing this and you see you went into over 500 meth labs in how many years was that

339
00:36:09.28 --> 00:36:16.000
four years and four years so that's like you know up hitting a meth lab every two or three maybe four

340
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:23.60
days going into those things did you feel like hey they're we're making a dent or sometimes

341
00:36:23.60 --> 00:36:27.20
you just feel like we're just overwhelmed and this is we could keep doing this forever

342
00:36:28.88 --> 00:36:34.80
it got to the point where it was bad for a while you almost felt overwhelmed but there was so many

343
00:36:34.80 --> 00:36:41.76
and it was so easy to get the precursor chemicals to manufacture a meth infetamine here in the

344
00:36:41.76 --> 00:36:49.84
United States so then we started as a whole DEA we started cracking down into the companies that

345
00:36:50.56 --> 00:36:56.88
made the a federal tablets or the pseudo-fedron pills which is one of the primary precursor

346
00:36:56.88 --> 00:37:03.60
chemicals of meth infetamine and would track where their shipping in made him harder to get and

347
00:37:03.60 --> 00:37:08.24
that's why you probably see like if you buy any coal medication that has pseudo-fedron you

348
00:37:08.24 --> 00:37:12.72
got to buy it you have to get it from behind the counter now right this people were going in just you

349
00:37:12.72 --> 00:37:18.08
know buy in two stealing tool two boxes and they call it like smurfing pills and they would get

350
00:37:18.08 --> 00:37:24.56
enough to make you know how much meth infetamine they wanted to make so that started really

351
00:37:24.56 --> 00:37:30.72
putting we saw that started putting a dent into it you know and course then all then

352
00:37:30.72 --> 00:37:36.80
originally when I was working these labs of course there was a lot of meth infetamine coming

353
00:37:36.80 --> 00:37:42.96
up for Mexico but it wasn't that pure so a lot of the true tweakers did not want it they wanted

354
00:37:42.96 --> 00:37:52.96
that real pure glass 98 99 you know percent pure meth infetamine which was homegrown made

355
00:37:53.68 --> 00:38:00.08
and then once the we you know cracked down the precursors in harder to get here

356
00:38:00.08 --> 00:38:06.32
Mexico started picking up their game and started making the real pure meth infetamine down in

357
00:38:06.32 --> 00:38:10.88
Mexico and sending it up through the border so that means you were dealing with the cartel the

358
00:38:10.88 --> 00:38:18.16
big drug cartels um yes a lot and especially when I worked in Phoenix you know course that's

359
00:38:18.16 --> 00:38:27.52
what is you know the Southwest is controlled by the Mexican drug cartels um do you have any you know

360
00:38:27.52 --> 00:38:36.24
big memorable operations or that you did that you were part of? He yes um like I said most of the

361
00:38:36.24 --> 00:38:44.72
labs were like mom and pop tweaker labs but I was able to do a couple of pretty big we call

362
00:38:44.72 --> 00:38:52.08
a Mexican national labs where they're making multiple possible pounds at one time and

363
00:38:52.08 --> 00:38:59.60
um the Sheriff's Office had some information that uh that's a couple guys came in they wanted

364
00:38:59.60 --> 00:39:08.40
to work for money and they do this big Mexican national lab west of Phoenix in an area called

365
00:39:08.40 --> 00:39:13.92
Westbrane Ranch you know we're like okay I went with a I went with another partner to see what they

366
00:39:13.92 --> 00:39:18.56
had to say you know a lot of times a lot of things can be BS and people over hype and over blow it up

367
00:39:18.56 --> 00:39:24.48
you know so we go out there and you know hey this is group of these Mexican nationals you know they're

368
00:39:24.48 --> 00:39:29.60
making you know 30, 40, 50 pounds in math that is time they're cooking out in this real

369
00:39:29.60 --> 00:39:38.96
rule location you know so we get a work up and start doing some investigation and identify

370
00:39:38.96 --> 00:39:44.96
where the people are living in the city and we have an informant just willing and knows when

371
00:39:44.96 --> 00:39:49.92
they're out there cooking you know so we're building up a plan and you know of course it's on

372
00:39:49.92 --> 00:39:54.16
the mill nowhere so there's no address of this place there's a parcel numbers you're getting like

373
00:39:54.16 --> 00:40:00.96
a GPS grid coordinates did this place and that's what's on the search warrant you know you know

374
00:40:00.96 --> 00:40:05.20
how are we gonna hit this place in a cooking or are we gonna do an air assault or what are we going

375
00:40:05.20 --> 00:40:12.80
to do so we finally it got up and um got close okay they said they're gonna cook this weekend

376
00:40:12.80 --> 00:40:18.56
and what's the time for him on all this how long does this take is it is it weeks is it days is

377
00:40:18.56 --> 00:40:25.12
it months it all depends it varies I think this one in particular um I think we were working on it for a

378
00:40:25.12 --> 00:40:32.96
couple months so the informant says I think they're gonna cook this weekend is it okay we'll get ready

379
00:40:32.96 --> 00:40:38.56
so you know we're preparing and getting you know as much information as we have it typed up in the

380
00:40:38.56 --> 00:40:44.08
search warrant and everything and we knew there was a property close to them which the guy was kind

381
00:40:44.08 --> 00:40:50.16
of involved and if they were gonna run from the lab location they more than likely they were

382
00:40:50.16 --> 00:40:57.04
gonna go high that they're that residents you know so then informant calls me okay they're going

383
00:40:57.04 --> 00:41:02.96
out and buying a bunch of ice so one of the processes of cooking method and you got to start adding

384
00:41:02.96 --> 00:41:09.04
ice to things and cool it down so we knew okay they're cooking they're almost they're getting close to

385
00:41:09.04 --> 00:41:16.24
done so we spent up the team we've put an affidab at what the the informant says and we get it

386
00:41:16.24 --> 00:41:21.76
signed by a judge and we were working with the sheriff's office at the time and it was decided

387
00:41:21.76 --> 00:41:26.16
we're not gonna do an air assault we're gonna convoy in there and you know this is a real

388
00:41:26.16 --> 00:41:31.12
location you know in your convoy you know when a desert type environment you're kicking up

389
00:41:31.12 --> 00:41:34.96
dust and stuff they can see you coming from five miles away how big of a team are you bringing

390
00:41:34.96 --> 00:41:42.80
and this is like an assault team yeah we're bringing the the the the the Maricopa County

391
00:41:42.80 --> 00:41:49.92
SWAT team you know it's probably 20 something individuals are lab team you know we probably got

392
00:41:51.12 --> 00:41:56.88
10 individuals or so and then we're bringing chemists and has them at and everything out so it's a

393
00:41:56.88 --> 00:42:04.88
pretty good force big convoy big convoy lot of dust he does stuff so of course the plan was

394
00:42:04.88 --> 00:42:10.32
the SWAT team is gonna hit the lab location do you put a recon element out at all or just do

395
00:42:10.32 --> 00:42:17.84
an aerial or nothing we had an aerial prior but we didn't have time to get people light in there

396
00:42:17.84 --> 00:42:23.92
late in there to do it we would have liked that to happen but it just wasn't feasible with the situation

397
00:42:23.92 --> 00:42:29.60
so of course the SWAT team hits it hey we got a huge lab up cooking but nobody's here

398
00:42:30.80 --> 00:42:39.04
I like oh shit so the group I was with we go to you know we so we let me catch that so the

399
00:42:39.04 --> 00:42:46.88
SWAT team hits it they find the lab and there's no people there yes it's up and cooking okay so

400
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.16
like I said earlier I said if they run they're probably gonna go to this other gentleman's house

401
00:42:52.16 --> 00:43:02.000
so we go to that house and we hear some noise and some scurrying in the house and

402
00:43:02.72 --> 00:43:09.04
we hear like a lady like calling for help so we're like damn they're in there

403
00:43:10.24 --> 00:43:16.16
so eggnets and circumstances we enter the house and they're all trying to hide in this back

404
00:43:16.16 --> 00:43:22.000
bedroom got one guys halfway up the chimney like guys lying in bed with his muddy boots and everything

405
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.96
all like he's sleeping and laying on the couch and I'm like really guys we're gonna fall for this

406
00:43:28.96 --> 00:43:33.76
so we brought him back over to the lab and you know processed the lab and then I'd be in a

407
00:43:34.80 --> 00:43:38.40
nice ice lab they think they had like 50 pounds of methane fedemine in solution

408
00:43:39.52 --> 00:43:46.64
and then at later led to they end up cooperating and then hit another big lab in south

409
00:43:46.64 --> 00:43:54.80
Phoenix and that individual he also was running labs in Riverside California too

410
00:43:55.76 --> 00:44:00.16
so he was wanted you know by Riverside Sheriff in this and that we end up hitting them and

411
00:44:00.88 --> 00:44:07.04
getting a big lab at that time when we make entry with the SWAT team and that's

412
00:44:07.04 --> 00:44:11.76
this guy was living on a horse property at horses and stuff. Where was this this guy was in Phoenix

413
00:44:11.76 --> 00:44:16.64
as well. Yes in our area. Yeah south Phoenix actually so this guy was a legit

414
00:44:17.92 --> 00:44:23.68
like yeah horses and a ranch of some kind. Oh yes I was doing well. In head of ranch in

415
00:44:25.04 --> 00:44:28.48
Riverside too. Yeah because I kind of get the impression you know when you talk about like the

416
00:44:28.48 --> 00:44:32.72
mom and pop labs that a lot of people are just kind of getting away with what they can

417
00:44:32.72 --> 00:44:36.40
and then they eventually get busted. Yeah they're broke but occasionally you have somebody that

418
00:44:36.40 --> 00:44:43.44
broke as a joke and these people they're they're in it for making the money and yeah it's

419
00:44:43.84 --> 00:44:51.36
this guy who we hit in south Phoenix he actually taught the other people in the lab how to cook.

420
00:44:52.40 --> 00:44:57.92
So yeah we we go in there and he's in the back cooking and he's cooking with a 22-liter

421
00:44:57.92 --> 00:45:02.72
flask. It's a big triple night flask. It's a good size flask about size of a basketball little bigger.

422
00:45:02.72 --> 00:45:09.36
So when a swat team goes in he takes the flask and smashes on the ground. But of course

423
00:45:09.36 --> 00:45:13.84
you take the samples there you know he's not gonna you know we figure out what's in there and

424
00:45:15.12 --> 00:45:20.80
so yeah I need you know we found some you know method that name in the house and everything

425
00:45:20.80 --> 00:45:25.92
we're like what's this? Oh that is feed for the horses and that's not feed for the damn horses come on.

426
00:45:25.92 --> 00:45:33.36
What happens to these guys you go then you wrap them up immediately go to jail.

427
00:45:33.36 --> 00:45:39.04
Wrap them up he went to jail you know they did some search warrants on his place in Riverside

428
00:45:39.60 --> 00:45:44.24
in California and then we and died at him and you know put him in prison for a while.

429
00:45:44.24 --> 00:45:50.24
How long is a while? Like this guy his name was Tara Thomas to Harrow Sanchez I think he got like 10 years.

430
00:45:50.24 --> 00:45:56.56
Hmm so he's probably out by he probably listening to this right now. Yeah probably perhaps you know

431
00:45:57.12 --> 00:46:01.52
you know but this lab oh hell this is back and who this one?

432
00:46:02.56 --> 00:46:09.76
99. So yeah foreshare yeah he's back out. You know I forgot to ask you this when you got in that

433
00:46:09.76 --> 00:46:16.64
shooting back when you're with the Detroit what did you have any lessons learned from that about the way it

434
00:46:16.64 --> 00:46:21.84
happened about what you what how your reaction was did you do something well did you do something bad

435
00:46:21.84 --> 00:46:25.68
did you feel like you're training work did you feel like your training didn't work like how how was that

436
00:46:25.68 --> 00:46:32.48
experience that yes that's a very good question with all the training we had you know the different

437
00:46:32.48 --> 00:46:38.000
scenarios and differentiated gun people I just reacted with my training you know I saw the

438
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.44
muzzle fly as I knew it was gunfire and you know I just did what I had to do to neutralize you know

439
00:46:45.44 --> 00:46:52.96
to stop the threat. So the training you had worked 100% you know I didn't even think you know I

440
00:46:52.96 --> 00:46:58.72
didn't even don't even remember looking through my sights I know I did you know you get that

441
00:46:58.72 --> 00:47:02.96
perceptual narrowing you know when you're in a fighter flight or a gunfight you know either

442
00:47:02.96 --> 00:47:08.72
eyesight increases you're hearing decreases you start so you fight motor skills so you felt all that

443
00:47:08.72 --> 00:47:14.80
stuff yes what about the you you were the passenger and another guy was driving yes did he get hit

444
00:47:14.80 --> 00:47:22.40
was he okay no he was okay he he fired like four or five shots and I had my MP five on full automatic

445
00:47:22.40 --> 00:47:30.08
and I just fired bursts into the weapon ran dry damn going full auto huh yeah I was like hey

446
00:47:30.08 --> 00:47:35.76
I'm gonna end this as quick as possible you know you people get all these you know lucky shots you

447
00:47:35.76 --> 00:47:40.56
chase and he's you know perpetrators whatever and they're running from you and they take the gun

448
00:47:40.56 --> 00:47:47.20
and shoot it over their head and hit you you know dead between eyes yeah yeah what about doing all

449
00:47:47.20 --> 00:47:53.60
these you know doing all these hits over the years with the DA down in the Phoenix area you know

450
00:47:53.60 --> 00:47:59.28
you you obviously are starting to pack away some good some good you know methodologies and

451
00:47:59.28 --> 00:48:04.64
and thought processes as you're going to do these things like all your big takeaways as you

452
00:48:04.64 --> 00:48:15.12
you as you developed as of you know as a agent I always was very tactically proficient and

453
00:48:15.12 --> 00:48:22.72
I think one of my four days in strong points as an agent was being able to deal with people

454
00:48:22.72 --> 00:48:28.64
and that's what I I suggest that anybody who gets in federal law enforcement I would advise them to be a

455
00:48:28.64 --> 00:48:33.92
local law enforcement officer first but you get to learn the job you get to learn how to deal with

456
00:48:33.92 --> 00:48:40.88
people and I happen to be very good at dealing with informants and I could work in formants well

457
00:48:40.88 --> 00:48:48.88
what do you think was that what made you good at it? One I think my street smart's growing up in Detroit

458
00:48:48.88 --> 00:48:53.92
you know and being able to talk to the lingo and look the part you know and life

459
00:48:54.56 --> 00:49:00.000
unfortunately a lot of times when you first go in a situation especially criminals they're going to

460
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.04
size you up they're going to say this this individual look like they know what they're doing

461
00:49:06.08 --> 00:49:11.44
can I trust this person you know but a lot of times these people that are working for us they're

462
00:49:11.44 --> 00:49:16.80
risking their life and they have to feel confident that you're going to do your best to protect them

463
00:49:17.52 --> 00:49:24.24
and I also learned never promise somebody something you can't deliver you know don't promise

464
00:49:24.24 --> 00:49:28.24
them well you know you work a couple weeks and you get a couple you know I can make all your

465
00:49:28.24 --> 00:49:33.28
charges go away it's not up it's not up to the agents you know you have to bring their

466
00:49:33.28 --> 00:49:39.44
cooperation attention to the prosecutor which then brings it to the judge and you know those decisions

467
00:49:39.44 --> 00:49:48.08
are made then and also treat people like a people a person you know you don't have to start you

468
00:49:48.08 --> 00:49:53.28
know I'll talking down to somebody you know I'm the big bad fad and you know you're just the

469
00:49:53.28 --> 00:49:59.76
lonely pion drug dealer you don't do that you know I start off giving everybody respect

470
00:50:00.48 --> 00:50:05.60
now if you want to go sideways we'll go sideways but I'm going to give you the benefit of the

471
00:50:05.60 --> 00:50:11.68
doubts at first you know we're in formance too you've got to be care you know they're in formance

472
00:50:11.68 --> 00:50:17.52
they're they're criminals you know you know that they can turn their back on you too

473
00:50:17.52 --> 00:50:24.64
so you've got to you know you never can trust them 100% you do your best and you know and

474
00:50:24.64 --> 00:50:29.84
you lay the you know lay the ground rules and everything and then you know you manage your

475
00:50:29.84 --> 00:50:36.24
informants you know going on from there but you know being you know having a good

476
00:50:36.24 --> 00:50:41.76
informant you're kind of like you know they're they're confident you know there's therapist everything

477
00:50:41.76 --> 00:50:45.12
else you know you're phone's gonna be ringing in middle of the night you're always going to

478
00:50:45.12 --> 00:50:49.20
want to talk to you you know because it's girlfriend left the left home he's you know they're doing

479
00:50:49.20 --> 00:50:53.36
this you know there you know you thinking about making a bad you know you need dance or

480
00:50:53.36 --> 00:51:00.16
little calls and a lot of people don't like to do that but if you want to do well at the job

481
00:51:00.16 --> 00:51:04.64
at a high level it's kind of things you have to do you gotta put the work in how many sources

482
00:51:04.64 --> 00:51:08.000
would you be running out of time I come in people would you be working with how many informants

483
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:15.20
I'm usually I kept anywhere from three to five informants at anyone given time

484
00:51:16.32 --> 00:51:22.56
what what is the trajectory of their lives look like I mean do they they end up they just do that

485
00:51:22.56 --> 00:51:26.64
to lay eventually get caught killed do they do it until they eventually you know do something

486
00:51:26.64 --> 00:51:34.64
that sends them to jail do they ever get out of that life it's kind of a mixture you know some

487
00:51:34.64 --> 00:51:38.24
do it you know they think they're slick and they're gonna play both sides and do they get caught

488
00:51:38.64 --> 00:51:44.000
they go to prison you know some get killed you know they get found out you know we do everything

489
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:49.52
we can to protect their identity and some do it for a while or some are you know trying to help

490
00:51:49.52 --> 00:51:56.88
their legal situation or a family member situation or just doing it for money and you know eventually

491
00:51:56.88 --> 00:52:04.48
move on and get on with their lives and get back into some normalcy of life you know and when I was

492
00:52:05.04 --> 00:52:10.40
a de agent and a police officer you know I didn't gauge my success on how many people I

493
00:52:10.40 --> 00:52:18.32
arrested and this and that I gauge my success on how many people did I help they get their life together

494
00:52:18.96 --> 00:52:23.68
you know just be as a person you know gets caught up in drugs or some crime activities

495
00:52:23.68 --> 00:52:28.24
it doesn't necessarily mean they're a bad person you know they made some bad decisions

496
00:52:28.24 --> 00:52:32.80
so I gauge my success mostly and hey how many people this year did I help?

497
00:52:35.20 --> 00:52:42.000
Yeah that's you must start to really understand the way people operate too especially dealing

498
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.04
with all these people and you're hearing from them all the time like the insight that you get

499
00:52:47.04 --> 00:52:51.76
into interacting with people are they they're showing up they're most of them though

500
00:52:51.76 --> 00:52:55.04
they do they most of the informants have some kind of criminal background and that's how they

501
00:52:55.04 --> 00:53:04.40
end up in this situation most of them do yes okay so at what point or where were you when

502
00:53:04.40 --> 00:53:10.88
September 11th happened? I was in my house in Phoenix beginning ready to go to the gym

503
00:53:11.68 --> 00:53:16.64
because I never knew how long I was going to work so I always been into working out and keep my

504
00:53:16.64 --> 00:53:21.84
stuff fit so I'd get up and work out before work and I'm sitting there watching the news and

505
00:53:21.84 --> 00:53:27.76
when the first plane hit said a small plane just hit the world trade center so then of course

506
00:53:27.76 --> 00:53:33.04
we're all you know people who grew to the TV then the second plane hit and they're like this is not a

507
00:53:33.04 --> 00:53:38.72
small plane and you know of course all the chaos and everything that went on that day I ended up

508
00:53:38.72 --> 00:53:44.72
going to the gym and you know work you know hey you know we don't know where we're going to get hit from

509
00:53:44.72 --> 00:53:50.32
next you know so it's all hands on deck and you know you know you had to plane hit the Pentagon

510
00:53:51.04 --> 00:53:56.40
and our DEA headquarters is right across the expressway from there so people went off

511
00:53:56.40 --> 00:54:02.64
and that side saw the plane smashed into the Pentagon and so if things were in chaos for a minute

512
00:54:02.64 --> 00:54:08.64
like to say the least and did they did they they start to think about how to utilize the DEA for

513
00:54:08.64 --> 00:54:15.44
immediately trying to assist like the national effort did it change I'm saying I guess I'm

514
00:54:15.44 --> 00:54:22.08
asking did it change like you're immediate life your immediate job or was it okay well we still

515
00:54:22.08 --> 00:54:27.04
got to you know arrest people that are making math so you're going to continue doing that or was

516
00:54:27.04 --> 00:54:32.32
it some kind of change what kind of happen that's one of the change that happened pretty fast was

517
00:54:32.32 --> 00:54:38.80
when we when we debrief in informant there's different things you have to put in there like

518
00:54:38.80 --> 00:54:44.40
different blocks you know what is the drug related activity they have known right now what

519
00:54:44.40 --> 00:54:49.44
is the non drug related activity and then they started a terrorist related activity

520
00:54:50.08 --> 00:54:59.20
did you know you know any people do interrius related activities and being in the clan lab scene

521
00:54:59.20 --> 00:55:07.68
so a lot of the individuals who sold and made money out of the effedrant in pseudo-fedron

522
00:55:08.24 --> 00:55:13.44
were middle eastern individuals so of course you know they were like you know you know

523
00:55:13.44 --> 00:55:18.64
get all your middle eastern informants and see if they have any terrorist activity and we had a lot

524
00:55:19.28 --> 00:55:22.88
DEA had a lot of middle eating you know with the drugs in the pseudo-fedron so

525
00:55:23.52 --> 00:55:27.68
FBI then wanted to come over started to brief in our informants you know about terror

526
00:55:27.68 --> 00:55:32.32
it terrorist related activities within a much of a connection there was a more than just trying to make

527
00:55:32.32 --> 00:55:38.24
money there was some you know there was some you know somewhere you know sending money back

528
00:55:38.24 --> 00:55:45.12
and things like that and you know when the military first went over to Afghanistan you know we

529
00:55:45.12 --> 00:55:49.92
had some intel we didn't know you know all the you know Ben Laden had his trained facilities over there

530
00:55:49.92 --> 00:55:56.80
but when the US military went over there they shortly realized that the Taliban in those

531
00:55:56.80 --> 00:56:02.000
and surgeon groups were making their money for their legal territories by the sale and

532
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:07.60
reduction of heroin and that's one of the first questions I get why is DEA I was DEA over in

533
00:56:07.60 --> 00:56:15.04
Afghanistan so and also the the military they knew they were not subject matter experts on that

534
00:56:15.68 --> 00:56:24.40
so that's when they reached out to the DEA hey guys gals we need help here and we didn't have a kind of

535
00:56:24.40 --> 00:56:33.76
tactical team that was up to speed to do this at the time years prior to that we had an operation

536
00:56:33.76 --> 00:56:41.44
called operations snow cap where we were in Columbia and other cocaine manufacturing destinations

537
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:49.12
and hitting Coca-labs you know with you know partner forces in this and that so DEA had to start

538
00:56:49.12 --> 00:56:55.76
up a team so they used some of the individuals that we were working snow cap and developed this

539
00:56:55.76 --> 00:57:05.04
fast team this foreign deployed advisory and support team to help the military and mentor our

540
00:57:05.04 --> 00:57:12.80
partner force over there because we really don't have over there you know any like criminal authority

541
00:57:13.68 --> 00:57:17.84
so in the Afghans they were behind the time so we went over you know the military you know they

542
00:57:17.84 --> 00:57:23.44
got plenty of trigger pullers and of course we can pull triggers too but they went for expertise on

543
00:57:23.44 --> 00:57:30.56
investigations and how do we handle these how do we process these lab because in Afghanistan even though

544
00:57:30.56 --> 00:57:35.44
heroin production is crazy the the penalties for getting caught manufacturing drugs over

545
00:57:35.44 --> 00:57:41.36
there are very very severe and we can actually take somebody off the battlefield a lot longer

546
00:57:42.16 --> 00:57:47.04
you know for drug related things then just for say you know you you know him somebody up

547
00:57:47.04 --> 00:57:53.92
for tactical questioning and then they're back directly on the battlefield you know but the issue is you

548
00:57:53.92 --> 00:58:01.12
know we're working with US and coalition special ops teams over there but most of these labs are

549
00:58:01.12 --> 00:58:06.32
well behind enemy lines and that's their money you know so they're going to fight like hell to keep

550
00:58:06.32 --> 00:58:12.08
them so you have to be up to speed to run with these you know these special ops guys you know so

551
00:58:12.08 --> 00:58:20.32
at first they just had a you know put a solicitation out hey you know this is what the mission is

552
00:58:20.32 --> 00:58:24.56
going to be we need some volunteers you know some of the guys been that done that in the past

553
00:58:24.56 --> 00:58:29.28
and maybe were special ops guys but at the current time maybe they weren't in the best shape

554
00:58:30.32 --> 00:58:36.08
and they would get over there and we're having problems keeping up got it so that's when

555
00:58:36.08 --> 00:58:43.04
our fast team institute a selection process and that selection process they took various

556
00:58:44.64 --> 00:58:50.16
areas of selection from different special ops teams and put a selection together you know

557
00:58:50.80 --> 00:58:55.92
and at what point did you hear about that and at what point did you volunteer for it

558
00:58:58.72 --> 00:59:05.52
I knew the fast team was going on you know I started hearing rumbles and rub out it

559
00:59:05.52 --> 00:59:16.08
in 2005 time frame but the problem is in the field the basic agents didn't really know

560
00:59:16.08 --> 00:59:21.84
was going on with this fast team I had a buddy that went to the fast team he was

561
00:59:23.36 --> 00:59:29.36
Marine Corps officer and I was pushing on with my career and I've always no matter what I've done

562
00:59:29.36 --> 00:59:36.08
I've tried to go to the highest level whatever I did in life so you know I was just kind of like

563
00:59:36.08 --> 00:59:41.28
sitting around and like hey you know what is fast team doing were you still in Phoenix at this time

564
00:59:41.28 --> 00:59:53.20
yes I was so you were in Phoenix from like 1998 1998 all so 1997 and until I actually got selected

565
00:59:53.20 --> 01:00:03.92
on the fast team and October 2009 so you there for a while you have over 10 years experience

566
01:00:04.56 --> 01:00:12.24
as a DEA agent on the ground doing and was that whole 10 years was that all that time doing the

567
01:00:12.24 --> 01:00:18.000
math lab stuff the first four years and then I went on to a conspiracy group where we were

568
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:27.12
higher level traffickers I worked on a task force with a lot of local officers when you're

569
01:00:27.12 --> 01:00:32.64
what's the conspiracy group all of a sudden it sounds cool we know that right you know he's

570
01:00:32.64 --> 01:00:37.60
exactly a lot of things are my sounds real cool you know if we have you know real cool acronyms

571
01:00:37.60 --> 01:00:43.12
and everything else you know you go you're going after mid level to higher level dealers

572
01:00:43.12 --> 01:00:50.72
and still mathematically or they're dealing everything math cocaine marijuana I'm okay

573
01:00:50.72 --> 01:00:56.96
heroin so you had a mixture of Phoenix is kind of a weird animal you're kind of close to the

574
01:00:56.96 --> 01:01:02.88
border so it's a trans shipment point so a lot of the drugs are coming in coming up from the

575
01:01:02.88 --> 01:01:09.28
southwest border into cities like Tucson and Phoenix in their states they're they only stay

576
01:01:09.28 --> 01:01:14.24
their short period of time and those drugs are picked up and sent out to the east coast you

577
01:01:14.24 --> 01:01:19.76
got to be like on your game to get stuff you know you might have a stash house loaded up one

578
01:01:19.76 --> 01:01:26.48
day and it's gone the next so you had to really be on your game you know and move fast to do these

579
01:01:26.48 --> 01:01:33.52
things so you know I worked in a combination of different groups and I call my buddy and I'm like hey

580
01:01:33.52 --> 01:01:38.32
what's how you guys doing there are you guys just doing training or you guys going out and doing

581
01:01:38.32 --> 01:01:44.16
missions he's also Joe you know we're you know working with some of the best units in the

582
01:01:44.16 --> 01:01:48.80
words this is when you're asking what your buddies about fast yes okay I got it you know

583
01:01:48.80 --> 01:01:52.56
what are you guys doing you know we're training working with some of the best units in the world

584
01:01:52.56 --> 01:01:58.40
world you know we're doing things what you would think DEA would be doing you know we're doing

585
01:01:58.40 --> 01:02:06.80
this high level stuff and at the time every year they would put out a solicitation for solid

586
01:02:06.80 --> 01:02:13.44
first to go through the fast selection and you need it to be at least a GS12 so that

587
01:02:13.92 --> 01:02:19.20
usually takes about three to four years to get to a GS level 12 and they wanted people who

588
01:02:20.08 --> 01:02:25.52
had experience of how to be a DEA agent so you and then you put in for the selection and then

589
01:02:25.52 --> 01:02:32.56
if you get picked you know you go through tryouts and I was 39 when I put in for selection

590
01:02:32.56 --> 01:02:37.76
you know as we get older we don't recover as fast as we once did some people yes

591
01:02:39.36 --> 01:02:44.24
if you're a pension you're you're a potential for injury sometimes increases so

592
01:02:44.24 --> 01:02:49.04
I knew I wouldn't quit anything I was just worried about my old body you know holding up I

593
01:02:49.04 --> 01:02:53.68
got a lot of miles out of you know 50,000 miles is kind of up and you know there's a lot of

594
01:02:53.68 --> 01:03:00.48
different swimming and different testing and different things and you know so I started training

595
01:03:00.48 --> 01:03:07.60
and and you're still doing your job working the conspiracy stuff this time I was on a task

596
01:03:07.60 --> 01:03:13.84
for a screw but what's the task force group there we were task force on the west side of the

597
01:03:13.84 --> 01:03:22.72
city and we worked with various west side police departments and they were all sworn in as

598
01:03:24.08 --> 01:03:29.28
federal task force agents so they had the full powers like a BDA agent you could you know do

599
01:03:29.28 --> 01:03:34.48
investigations over state lines and everything and we were hitting a lot of like big marijuana

600
01:03:34.48 --> 01:03:40.32
hits, meth hits, cocaine hits so I was still yes doing my full-time job and then have to

601
01:03:40.88 --> 01:03:47.84
get ready and train for the selection any good between on the conspiracy thing like what's the

602
01:03:47.84 --> 01:03:57.52
biggest people you ever rolled up when you're doing the conspiracy gig we had one case this one group

603
01:03:57.52 --> 01:04:08.000
and they were an African American group they were had people out of Detroit, Ed Lanta and Los Angeles

604
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:15.60
and Phoenix they would get their large amounts of shipments of marijuana from the Phoenix and

605
01:04:15.60 --> 01:04:25.60
Tucson area now we're talking large amounts I'm talking they would buy 23,000 pounds of marijuana at a time

606
01:04:25.60 --> 01:04:33.84
and we had in front of Mexico yes well they buy it in Phoenix they don't the marijuana came

607
01:04:33.84 --> 01:04:39.36
up from Mexico you know of course you buy it in south west is a lot cheaper than you bring it

608
01:04:39.36 --> 01:04:43.76
out east and you can sell it from a double the price so there's a lot of money involved we have

609
01:04:43.76 --> 01:04:48.40
an informant you know these guys are rich and they have this huge place in this gated community

610
01:04:48.40 --> 01:04:53.92
and Scott's Dale and all these truckers that are driving for them and everything so it's full on

611
01:04:53.92 --> 01:04:59.60
you know full on enterprise you know but you you gotta be kind of suspect a little bit you know

612
01:04:59.60 --> 01:05:08.56
yeah this is a little far fetched you know so the informant says okay they're meeting they're

613
01:05:08.56 --> 01:05:14.72
gonna meet their sources supply and they're gonna do a deal and I'm gonna be at the house

614
01:05:14.72 --> 01:05:22.72
so like okay we set up we have a general area where we think they're in nice house is

615
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.36
and so we got some people set up in that vicinity and they go into this residence

616
01:05:30.40 --> 01:05:35.52
in Phoenix and they pull a van in the garage we're like okay this looks good

617
01:05:36.64 --> 01:05:41.44
so the van leaves the garage and informant says okay they picked up

618
01:05:41.44 --> 01:05:46.96
so sure a shit they're found a van and we take it this gated community in Scott's Dale

619
01:05:48.08 --> 01:05:52.64
well you gotta you know get keyed in and buzzed in and everything and we

620
01:05:53.92 --> 01:05:59.44
sit on the house and get it identified where they're at and see people coming and going

621
01:05:59.44 --> 01:06:04.32
and they follow them out and sure a shit they go to a warehouse too or there's a semi truck

622
01:06:04.32 --> 01:06:13.60
oh like oh it's on and pop and now so we get enough for a search warrant for the house

623
01:06:14.56 --> 01:06:20.000
and the warehouse and hit it and get pretty good large amount of marijuana

624
01:06:20.80 --> 01:06:26.16
and during this time one of the we follow one of the guys and to the airport and you know

625
01:06:26.16 --> 01:06:31.52
work kind of short numbers we got people all over the place and I'm by myself following this guy

626
01:06:31.52 --> 01:06:36.16
and it's very hard to do surveillance by yourself without getting burnt you know without

627
01:06:36.16 --> 01:06:42.88
them seeing you and I don't know how I pulled it off but I did so what are you wearing

628
01:06:43.44 --> 01:06:48.88
just street clothes just street clothes you know I did some of those surveillance and counter

629
01:06:48.88 --> 01:06:54.16
surveillance and like dressed up and you know trying to look like a bomb in this in that man I

630
01:06:54.16 --> 01:07:00.80
I was horrible I was like the worst I was like the worst undercover person ever I don't know

631
01:07:00.80 --> 01:07:06.96
it seems like you would have a similar issue since you're pretty jacked you know you just

632
01:07:06.96 --> 01:07:11.28
stand out and a crowd yes you know so you just kind of you know if you were following me I'm

633
01:07:11.28 --> 01:07:17.20
100% gonna know you're not gonna sneak around following me is not happening yeah I'm

634
01:07:17.20 --> 01:07:20.80
foot spales is very hard you know so you're you're in a vehicle you're trying to stay far back

635
01:07:20.80 --> 01:07:25.60
as you can and everything and some of I pulled it off and as the person got out of the

636
01:07:25.60 --> 01:07:30.56
let they let the person out to go into the terminal I some I got one hand a snap the photo of

637
01:07:30.56 --> 01:07:37.92
Amanha I pulled it off but I did not happen to be the main guy so we ended up getting the

638
01:07:37.92 --> 01:07:42.56
again I'm getting a picture of him and we didn't know you know who he was at the time or not

639
01:07:42.56 --> 01:07:49.44
and he was flying back to LA you know so we headed you know get some people in custody and then

640
01:07:49.44 --> 01:07:58.40
get the person identified who dropped him off and she had some prior crammer history so we knew this

641
01:07:58.40 --> 01:08:04.48
case was you know bigger and tied into all these states and everything so I told my partner I said

642
01:08:04.48 --> 01:08:15.84
hey we're gonna go visit this lady tomorrow we're gonna bluffer and we're gonna say hey you know

643
01:08:15.84 --> 01:08:21.20
you know we got you taking this person yada yada yada yada you know and you're

644
01:08:21.20 --> 01:08:25.52
helped in the furtherance of this conspiracy to their drug traffic and organization you have

645
01:08:25.52 --> 01:08:29.84
some criminal history in the past you know you know we're gonna potentially look at and

646
01:08:29.84 --> 01:08:34.72
die to you and maybe season your vehicle and my partner had the time she goes it'll never work

647
01:08:34.72 --> 01:08:40.08
I said watch you just trying to get her to roll just get her to roll I said watch so we

648
01:08:40.08 --> 01:08:46.40
not gonna door so so you're wearing plain clothes plain clothes you got like a badge around the neck

649
01:08:46.40 --> 01:08:53.84
and the chain you know like TV and the pair jeans you want to look as unintimulating as

650
01:08:53.84 --> 01:08:58.48
possible if you want to look intimidating like what's your what's your like what's your character

651
01:08:58.48 --> 01:09:03.60
what character you're going into just kind of this kind of low key intimidating enough with

652
01:09:03.60 --> 01:09:08.08
you know you're you know federal law enforcement you know you're not playing around but you know

653
01:09:08.08 --> 01:09:13.52
you're trying to you know you've got to build rapport with these people too you know

654
01:09:13.52 --> 01:09:19.28
you know to try to get some common interest and my partner at the time your partner was

655
01:09:19.28 --> 01:09:23.52
may say in this sandal never works she's like I don't think this will work Joe she was some

656
01:09:23.52 --> 01:09:29.12
a new agent and I said just watch I said watch him sometimes who works sometimes it doesn't

657
01:09:29.12 --> 01:09:34.24
we got like a 50 50 here would give it a try and you don't worry that you're gonna give away

658
01:09:34.24 --> 01:09:41.44
the fact that you're on to him you know at this point you know we had you know significant

659
01:09:41.44 --> 01:09:48.08
on to people in custody okay so you know you know they know we're on to them at what extent

660
01:09:48.08 --> 01:09:52.96
they don't know you know but I tell people too you can't make cases sitting behind your deck

661
01:09:52.96 --> 01:09:58.72
at that's all the time you got to get out there and shake the bush so she's kind of naysaying

662
01:09:58.72 --> 01:10:07.12
me and this person ended up being a topless dancer one of the gentleman clubs and Phoenix where

663
01:10:08.80 --> 01:10:12.72
there's a lot of the the Mexican sources go hang out there and a lot of the people from

664
01:10:12.72 --> 01:10:20.48
out of town come in there to find sources and this person this informant she was known to dates

665
01:10:20.48 --> 01:10:25.76
a lot of these out of town drug dealers and she would hook them up with the sources of supply

666
01:10:27.52 --> 01:10:34.64
so we go talk to her and not gonna door and you can tell by her face she's like oh shit

667
01:10:35.60 --> 01:10:40.48
and we just lay it out and I said this is what can happen to you this is okay I cooperate what

668
01:10:40.48 --> 01:10:50.96
do you want to know so we started working with her was wrong yeah he had also you know I guess

669
01:10:50.96 --> 01:10:58.32
she didn't get lucky sometimes and I got lucky then so we ended up using her and going back

670
01:10:58.32 --> 01:11:04.16
and they kept coming to town but of course they moved their operation to another spot and then

671
01:11:04.16 --> 01:11:09.92
we were able to investigate and look at all these other seizures that happened in different states

672
01:11:10.72 --> 01:11:16.24
and tie them all together to these people you know interviewing actually interviewing the truck

673
01:11:16.24 --> 01:11:23.68
drivers got their sources to supply you know pulled receipts from hotels and and plain things at

674
01:11:23.68 --> 01:11:30.48
different time when they were supposed to do these deals and were able to tie everything together

675
01:11:30.48 --> 01:11:38.16
and some of these people we had never caught them red handed with drugs but just what testimony

676
01:11:38.16 --> 01:11:45.20
by the informants putting the things together by pulling receipts we ended up hammering this group

677
01:11:48.24 --> 01:11:53.04
and getting them all charged and indicted when a lot of these other groups couldn't do it

678
01:11:53.04 --> 01:12:00.48
and I actually helped my partner get her GS13 because at DEA are kind of journeyman levels

679
01:12:00.48 --> 01:12:06.64
GS13 and you have to do so many things you know you have to have these complicated cases

680
01:12:06.64 --> 01:12:14.08
and or dinner wire tap or did some undercover so I actually helped him get her 13 and I was already

681
01:12:14.08 --> 01:12:19.36
on the fast team when they went and did the take down but they said just to see these people's faces

682
01:12:19.36 --> 01:12:28.000
like oh shit you got all the sun made oh crap and we used her to do quite a bit of other good cases too

683
01:12:28.96 --> 01:12:33.44
did you ever do any undercover work yes I did something what was that like

684
01:12:34.80 --> 01:12:39.52
how and everybody thinks it's intense everybody thinks that you need to look like a drug

685
01:12:39.52 --> 01:12:47.76
guy to do undercover now kind of the contrary like a DEA we're dealing with people are in

686
01:12:47.76 --> 01:12:52.64
to make money so a lot of these people look like business people and it's kind of as long as you talk

687
01:12:52.64 --> 01:13:00.72
to talk you know you're alright so undercover I've reversed chemicals and equipment to make

688
01:13:00.72 --> 01:13:08.64
meth under cover I bought meth and fedamine in larger amounts I bought heroin and then

689
01:13:09.20 --> 01:13:15.04
there's an individual which a lot of people have heard their name before they used to be a

690
01:13:15.04 --> 01:13:20.80
famous mob hitman Sam with the vulgar vinyl he was out in Phoenix and witness protection

691
01:13:21.68 --> 01:13:28.08
but still doing bad activities so they actually put me under cover he actually had this group

692
01:13:28.08 --> 01:13:35.68
of kids out there they were in the MMA and they were selling ecstasy in steroids and his group

693
01:13:35.68 --> 01:13:40.08
ago around and they would beat up like they would pick up minorities and jump him like five on one

694
01:13:40.08 --> 01:13:46.16
kind of like a one percent or motorcycle gang thing and they put me in there to buy steroids

695
01:13:46.16 --> 01:13:52.48
from these kids so I ended up buying steroids from these kids and then later led to Sammy the

696
01:13:52.48 --> 01:13:58.88
bull getting to additional legal problems well where is he out right now I'm not sure

697
01:13:58.88 --> 01:14:05.68
we's at the moment that's crazy when you're doing these undercover ones that you're talking

698
01:14:05.68 --> 01:14:10.08
about are you staying under cover for a long period of time or you basically going under cover for

699
01:14:10.08 --> 01:14:16.16
two hours to go meet these guys buy some shit and then roll out did you ever do these guys

700
01:14:16.16 --> 01:14:20.32
it seems like they're going under cover for extended period of time that's called like a deep

701
01:14:20.32 --> 01:14:25.76
cover operation those don't happen that much anymore you know there's a lot of risk involved

702
01:14:25.76 --> 01:14:31.52
then there you know so you know there was some like some of the pseudo cases were like I

703
01:14:31.52 --> 01:14:36.80
played a role for like months at a time but a lot of it was done over the phone and stuff but

704
01:14:36.80 --> 01:14:41.12
most of them was like you know you're meeting with the guy you know you know if you're this

705
01:14:41.12 --> 01:14:48.40
hour or two you know you're under cover role and then you're moving on to the next thing you know

706
01:14:48.40 --> 01:14:54.88
in the biggest thing when people think if you know you're undercover and a suspect are you

707
01:14:54.88 --> 01:14:58.88
the police you're supposed to tell them yes I am you don't have to tell them the truth

708
01:14:58.88 --> 01:15:04.08
oh that's not true no that's not true and when you're interviewing people you don't have to

709
01:15:04.08 --> 01:15:08.56
tell them the truth either you know you're interviewing a couple people and like when you're like

710
01:15:08.56 --> 01:15:12.80
you can't talk to that girl you told her you had all this information yes or you arrested a couple

711
01:15:12.80 --> 01:15:16.64
people and hey your buddies and next room this role is going to be on this guts I knew saying it's

712
01:15:16.64 --> 01:15:22.64
your dope and your gun isn't no no no no it's his you know and I think you need to tell the truth

713
01:15:22.64 --> 01:15:27.92
and that too you know you can and those circumstances you don't have to necessarily tell the truth

714
01:15:27.92 --> 01:15:34.08
did you do a lot of that interrogation type stuff yes and you get trained to do that did you

715
01:15:34.08 --> 01:15:37.60
said you did they said you through training or was it just what you learned over the years

716
01:15:38.96 --> 01:15:42.72
in the academy you learned the basics of it and there's different schools like the

717
01:15:42.72 --> 01:15:49.52
read school and everything I never went to a formal school most of that I got was on the job training

718
01:15:50.32 --> 01:15:55.36
you know I got what some you know agents and some local police that were good at it

719
01:15:55.36 --> 01:16:01.44
and just picked up and learned you know hey this seems to work this doesn't work you know so

720
01:16:01.44 --> 01:16:07.52
I just like I said I kind of a knack at getting people to talk and also like I said good with

721
01:16:07.52 --> 01:16:14.72
informants all right so after you got done with that conspiracy thing what was the next thing

722
01:16:14.72 --> 01:16:18.96
you had the west side task force and the west side task force that's where you're working with

723
01:16:18.96 --> 01:16:27.12
the regular police from Phoenix and you're all working together to try and do good do good yes

724
01:16:27.12 --> 01:16:31.92
you know and people don't realize that without the local law enforcement we can't do our job

725
01:16:32.56 --> 01:16:38.48
you know the locals they know the area they have the local connects and everything and most of the

726
01:16:38.48 --> 01:16:45.84
DEA groups have local law enforcement officers sworn in as task force agents in the groups

727
01:16:45.84 --> 01:16:51.84
you know but we can't do the do the job by herself and I kind of helped me me working at a local

728
01:16:51.84 --> 01:16:58.16
law enforcement agency first too I kind of had respect and street cred from a lot of the local

729
01:16:58.16 --> 01:17:03.36
officers and I didn't think I was as big bad hif you know federal agent and you're just just

730
01:17:03.36 --> 01:17:09.76
lowly pion law enforcement officers you know I I respected them and so what are you guys doing

731
01:17:09.76 --> 01:17:16.80
you guys going after like different levels of drug dealers or what's what makes that west side

732
01:17:16.80 --> 01:17:23.44
task force different than just regular DEA it was we focus on the west side okay and the west the

733
01:17:23.44 --> 01:17:28.88
west area suburbs and is it is it the fact that you're working with them closely in interoperability

734
01:17:28.88 --> 01:17:34.40
and exchanging information that gives you a better chance of catching bad guys yes and it also bolsters

735
01:17:34.40 --> 01:17:42.000
our numbers too and we actually in a swiss eye task force we actually worked in one of the

736
01:17:42.88 --> 01:17:48.72
west side police agencies off-site locations for the Glendale Police Department in Arizona

737
01:17:49.60 --> 01:17:56.000
so we're actually you know you're with them every day day in day out so same thing you're doing

738
01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:01.84
investigations but you're utilizing the local cops to help you do the investigations correct is that right

739
01:18:01.84 --> 01:18:08.48
yes okay so you're doing that and then I kind of pulled you back in the story a little bit

740
01:18:08.48 --> 01:18:14.000
but you but then you you started hearing about the fast company and what you could do what that's

741
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.76
gonna look like but you're 39 years old you got some mileage on yes chances and so you're trying

742
01:18:19.76 --> 01:18:24.88
to get in shape for that how do you find out you got picked up or what was the application process like

743
01:18:24.88 --> 01:18:28.72
well you know he had to fill just you know fill out this questionnaire you know I've been on the job

744
01:18:28.72 --> 01:18:34.16
you know this many years and this is kind of the background of things I did on a job and you have to get

745
01:18:34.16 --> 01:18:42.80
your concurrence from your supervisor and then the concurrence from the special agent and

746
01:18:42.80 --> 01:18:49.68
charge whatever division you're in and you submit it and if you're qualified your name is picked

747
01:18:49.68 --> 01:18:56.16
to go to selection so they set a date for selection and they give you a list of you know

748
01:18:56.16 --> 01:19:02.64
hey these are some of the events you're gonna have to do kind of give you outline how to train for them

749
01:19:03.60 --> 01:19:10.88
you know you have to do our standard DAPT test which is no great shake you know you have to do the

750
01:19:10.88 --> 01:19:20.32
shooting pistol and lawn rifle but you get a score higher rock marches you know with weight on

751
01:19:20.32 --> 01:19:26.80
you you're doing a certain time a distance run you know all these different thinking and you know

752
01:19:26.80 --> 01:19:32.32
kind of thinking on your feet and leadership different tasks and things and you actually have to

753
01:19:32.32 --> 01:19:42.80
we use actually use this company that they before a lot of people in the military go to

754
01:19:42.80 --> 01:19:48.96
different special options they have to take this test online which is kind of like a psychological

755
01:19:48.96 --> 01:19:55.84
and like an IQ test and you got to answer these questions and then they can pretty much figure

756
01:19:55.84 --> 01:20:00.40
out if a person's gonna make it or not do how you do these things somebody needs to tell the

757
01:20:00.40 --> 01:20:06.48
damn seal teams about back because we sell 1180 percent attrition rate after however many years

758
01:20:06.48 --> 01:20:11.84
it's been 60 years or the actually no it's been for even 70 80 years of doing that training

759
01:20:11.84 --> 01:20:15.12
and putting people through that training we still can't figure who's gonna make it well

760
01:20:15.12 --> 01:20:24.48
African quit you know and we do you know say and I think we started with I think there was

761
01:20:24.48 --> 01:20:30.40
close to 40 of us in our selection and only 11 made it through to this selection take place

762
01:20:30.40 --> 01:20:37.52
chronicle the first part yes the first week it takes part in chronicle all in house it's kind of like

763
01:20:37.52 --> 01:20:45.44
is it a beat down oh yes it's kind of like we call like our hell week and who's running it is

764
01:20:45.44 --> 01:20:52.64
agents from fast and fast how long has fast been around for? Was it created after September 11?

765
01:20:52.64 --> 01:20:58.40
Yes after September 11 yes but you said there was a previous like unit that would snow cap

766
01:20:58.40 --> 01:21:02.56
yes that was prior to that so they took maybe some old snow cap people brought them back

767
01:21:02.56 --> 01:21:07.68
and see if they could help out something like yes how to you know get them get the unit organized

768
01:21:07.68 --> 01:21:12.24
in the training and logistics and you know weaponry you know but you're going to overseas fight

769
01:21:12.24 --> 01:21:17.76
in the war so you're using weapons and weapons systems the average DEA agent doesn't never

770
01:21:17.76 --> 01:21:24.16
use in their career you know you're using you know belt-fed crew surf weapons you know grenade launchers

771
01:21:24.16 --> 01:21:35.60
you know handheld mortars Carl Gustav rockets you know laws you know kind of crap you know so

772
01:21:36.32 --> 01:21:42.56
you know you're doing all this stuff so you know you they really you know invest in you and like

773
01:21:42.56 --> 01:21:48.24
once if you make it through training you make it through selection and you get picked up on a fast

774
01:21:48.24 --> 01:21:53.28
team you have to least commit doing three years because they're putting all this time in effort

775
01:21:53.28 --> 01:22:01.52
and training into you so what made most people quit how long was it how long was the selection

776
01:22:01.52 --> 01:22:06.88
process the first hell week was like a week and you had tier one events they were their past failed

777
01:22:07.76 --> 01:22:13.76
and if you fail one event you're gone and then we had tier two events where tier one event

778
01:22:13.76 --> 01:22:18.24
would be a force rock march force rock marchers and tiles here's the time yeah it's like it's right

779
01:22:18.24 --> 01:22:27.28
here's the time a distance run was like a five mile run our PT test shooting test

780
01:22:28.72 --> 01:22:36.24
things of that nature a basic swim crawl got it and then the tier two were like this you know

781
01:22:36.24 --> 01:22:42.96
different other events and if you failed one tier two you were put on probation and then if you failed

782
01:22:42.96 --> 01:22:48.72
another one you could get removed we also had peer revalues throughout too because we had learned

783
01:22:51.36 --> 01:22:56.24
life lessons you know some people can just fly through all the physical activity things and

784
01:22:56.24 --> 01:23:01.28
some people had a lot of military experience but they can't play well with others so you're

785
01:23:01.28 --> 01:23:06.64
living in confined spaces you know and you're just living with an asshole and we didn't have time for

786
01:23:06.64 --> 01:23:12.40
that so you could actually get peered out too so sort of people quitting this selection or they

787
01:23:12.40 --> 01:23:20.72
just not passing those standards about about half a both you know you know and when you go

788
01:23:20.72 --> 01:23:25.60
through there they're telling you what you're getting into you know this is what you're getting into

789
01:23:26.56 --> 01:23:32.80
and this unit is not for everybody and just because it may not be for you it doesn't mean that

790
01:23:32.80 --> 01:23:37.84
you're a bad agent that you can't do your normal job but this is what you're getting into and

791
01:23:37.84 --> 01:23:42.08
it's a whole that's a total volunteer unit so you get people that are going through

792
01:23:42.08 --> 01:23:47.20
slacking you're just getting your dick knocked into dirt and you know and if it was just you know

793
01:23:47.20 --> 01:23:52.56
you did you every day you did like a tier one event you'd be fine but you're also getting hazed

794
01:23:52.56 --> 01:23:59.36
in between you know and carrying the logs and the inflatable boats and you know doing crossfit

795
01:23:59.36 --> 01:24:05.28
workouts and you know you're 39 years old you're not getting much sleep but they're feeding you

796
01:24:05.28 --> 01:24:14.56
well it was the average age of the rest of the class I would say low 30s so you know

797
01:24:14.56 --> 01:24:22.16
did you have trouble with anything the water stuff I've always looked like you might be a

798
01:24:22.16 --> 01:24:29.92
little bit of a sinker and I learned that muscle does not float as I say that man yeah we learned

799
01:24:29.92 --> 01:24:35.68
that the seal things like you get these big jacked guys that are not only big and jacked also

800
01:24:35.68 --> 01:24:40.16
ripped and that means they don't have a lot of body fat and that doesn't lean this doesn't help either

801
01:24:40.16 --> 01:24:44.40
oh yeah lean this doesn't help either you know so I grew up with a swimming pool and we had a

802
01:24:44.40 --> 01:24:49.36
cottage on the lake in Michigan so obviously I was saying I was fairly confident in water

803
01:24:50.08 --> 01:24:58.32
but just in I had to learn in the pool you have to relax the more you get yourself worked out

804
01:24:58.32 --> 01:25:04.56
you get oxygen deprived and then you're screwed so you know for treading water for long periods

805
01:25:04.56 --> 01:25:12.72
of time and you know swimming and beaty use and boots and everything you have to stay calm

806
01:25:13.60 --> 01:25:17.84
you know we didn't quite do the 50 meter underwater swim like you got we did a 25

807
01:25:17.84 --> 01:25:23.52
you know and beaty use and to me you know it's like you know they kind of tell you know go deep

808
01:25:23.52 --> 01:25:29.60
and you know and stroke and glide and you know I'm doing all that and then when you get close to

809
01:25:29.60 --> 01:25:36.72
the wall it's like I'm starting to do the panic swim you know you know I'm screwing myself you know

810
01:25:37.76 --> 01:25:42.56
you know so yeah relax and glide that's as you're said that done in many things exactly you know

811
01:25:42.56 --> 01:25:48.000
and keep in your breathing controlled and everything you know so you know after I did enough to

812
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:54.88
pass with the swimming so afterwards when I got selected on the fast team they have to be I had a

813
01:25:54.88 --> 01:25:59.92
pool over there so I'd go there a couple times a week and just go into water and just swim and get

814
01:25:59.92 --> 01:26:05.76
better at it so so how long was the whole selection process you know you the first week is like

815
01:26:05.76 --> 01:26:15.84
the hell week and then you do a training phase next and that's usually a couple months and that's

816
01:26:15.84 --> 01:26:22.88
usually run by a ODE Green Bra team or with us it was going to be Naval Special Warfare

817
01:26:23.76 --> 01:26:29.52
but the seals and I was the first group that was done by the seals and sometimes the first part

818
01:26:29.52 --> 01:26:39.28
goes and then you go right into your training phase and learning the first part goes

819
01:26:39.28 --> 01:26:45.36
how we how we can then go to people to quit yes and then you go right into your training phase but

820
01:26:45.36 --> 01:26:50.96
we got to have a break because we were going to use a Navy Special Warfare not more going to be

821
01:26:50.96 --> 01:26:57.60
ready for a couple months so we got to go home and heal up and lick your wounds a little bit you

822
01:26:57.60 --> 01:27:02.000
know I pretty much had a blister and every part of my foot I lost every toenail and both feet and

823
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.60
at the time my girlfriend picked me up from the airport after the hell we can she's like

824
01:27:05.60 --> 01:27:12.16
what happened to you of course I was beat the shit head to go to the ER room the next day

825
01:27:12.16 --> 01:27:16.24
as I put was infected you know I'm trying to tell him what happened they're looking at me like

826
01:27:17.84 --> 01:27:24.08
I don't this doesn't sound right you volunteered for this you volunteered and just because you

827
01:27:24.08 --> 01:27:31.36
make it through everything say the hell week still the fast cadre they sit down and you have to

828
01:27:31.36 --> 01:27:38.08
be asked to go on to the second phase of training so I made it through that and got to go home

829
01:27:38.72 --> 01:27:43.28
just lick your wounds for a little bit and go back to working your regular group and then we

830
01:27:43.28 --> 01:27:52.56
reported in early spring we started selection I think February 2009 early spring of that year

831
01:27:53.36 --> 01:27:59.68
to a little creek Virginia to do our second phase of training so we're like okay I think we're

832
01:27:59.68 --> 01:28:02.80
gonna tell this is your learning phase this is supposed to be the gentleman's course now

833
01:28:03.60 --> 01:28:08.72
Roger Roger that so you know the seals had never had outside people there either

834
01:28:09.60 --> 01:28:14.80
so we show up and some of the cadre and some of the people from team 2 and 10

835
01:28:15.60 --> 01:28:21.20
hey we got so much old B to use for you guys and when you guys getting your badges and this

836
01:28:21.20 --> 01:28:26.56
and that they didn't have no clue I'm like well I have my past 12 years and you know we pretty much

837
01:28:26.56 --> 01:28:33.76
got a lot of high speed stuff so we're staying at the Navy in there and little creek and so we

838
01:28:33.76 --> 01:28:41.92
report 0-30 to first day and for formation of PT and we go straight to the ocean

839
01:28:42.72 --> 01:28:48.56
good times team 2 in the ocean out of the ocean you know sugar cookies home I'm like oh really

840
01:28:48.56 --> 01:28:55.60
I'm like I thought this was supposed to be a gentleman course and they were like we were told to

841
01:28:55.60 --> 01:29:00.80
treat you guys like buds I'm like who the hell told you that you know so you know you gotta

842
01:29:00.80 --> 01:29:07.04
got hammered and but you know they kind of you know slacked off you know for a while and you know

843
01:29:07.04 --> 01:29:12.64
he had different things distance runs and stuff so we spent time training there and then

844
01:29:12.64 --> 01:29:18.64
we bumped over to for Chaffey Arkansas to do the Land Warfare part of that and you know it was

845
01:29:18.64 --> 01:29:26.48
gave us it was very very good training to say the least and it was funny before we went over there

846
01:29:27.12 --> 01:29:32.64
and we found out the seals were gonna do our second phase and other buddy who was very confident

847
01:29:33.28 --> 01:29:37.36
but he was struggling to water low bed I called him and I was like do you hear who doing our

848
01:29:37.36 --> 01:29:45.44
second phase he goes yeah the seals like oh yeah and then you cut you ended up coming out

849
01:29:45.44 --> 01:29:49.36
the west coast to do some training too because you just laid around that's after I got selected

850
01:29:49.36 --> 01:29:58.96
on the fast team okay so when did you actually get selected October of 2009 okay and just because

851
01:29:58.96 --> 01:30:02.88
you make it through all the training it doesn't mean you're gonna be picked up on the fast team

852
01:30:03.60 --> 01:30:11.76
because as openings occur they you can get cherry pick from the list god got it so you

853
01:30:11.76 --> 01:30:17.44
was there anything else about the the initial training course when you were at team two

854
01:30:17.44 --> 01:30:22.08
you went to for Chaffey you go do training out there are you training with a task unit or they

855
01:30:22.08 --> 01:30:27.44
just put you through training as your own entity that one it wasn't like they were as our own

856
01:30:27.44 --> 01:30:33.60
entity oh really so you had you know people from trade it there and actually a senior chief

857
01:30:33.60 --> 01:30:43.04
um 20 gale was assigned to you know yeah yeah 20 he's he's such a beast so he's like

858
01:30:45.84 --> 01:30:53.20
smaller than me he shorter than me he looks like how do I describe this he don't look like

859
01:30:53.20 --> 01:30:57.36
he's like a super beast but he's faster than me and he could bench press more than me so he was

860
01:30:57.36 --> 01:31:03.28
like better than me at everything and no one would ever you know suspect that and you know he can

861
01:31:03.28 --> 01:31:07.12
go through the obstacle course pretty good just freaking awesome he's freaking awesome then he had a

862
01:31:07.12 --> 01:31:14.72
a uh master chief hitchcock to help out right on right off yeah both of those guys with things and so

863
01:31:14.72 --> 01:31:20.08
yeah it was um it was it was it was intense and of course we would do different events

864
01:31:20.72 --> 01:31:25.04
you know what the team guys and if we did a distance front of course they put their distance

865
01:31:25.04 --> 01:31:29.68
front stud out there oh yeah or if we did a crossfit workout they put you know they're best

866
01:31:29.68 --> 01:31:36.08
crossfit her out there you know you know so they kind of cherry picked you know people what

867
01:31:36.08 --> 01:31:40.000
you know I don't blame them you know when you shop there okay so we're doing a distance

868
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:46.000
front you couldn't wear any watch no GPS and we're just gonna run and so you guys get did get it

869
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.84
hooked up with a little bit of extra bonus program yeah and it wouldn't tell you know how long

870
01:31:51.84 --> 01:31:57.28
we're running for you know I've always been a bigger guy and I cut weight for that so I knew

871
01:31:57.28 --> 01:32:02.40
we'd do an all-than-dernstuff so I was sitting around 212 20 but we had some guys on our team

872
01:32:02.40 --> 01:32:07.20
to look into 160s you know I can run a couple six-minute miles but I can't run six-minute miles

873
01:32:07.20 --> 01:32:12.56
for 10 minutes and we had somebody's little rabbits they could do that not not me you know I

874
01:32:12.56 --> 01:32:17.68
blow through a crossfit workout no problem but you know so we've gone these distance running

875
01:32:17.68 --> 01:32:20.72
and we wouldn't you wouldn't know how long you were going for when you were done it's like

876
01:32:20.72 --> 01:32:26.56
you know just do your best you know okay what's the time hack here we didn't not tell you you

877
01:32:26.56 --> 01:32:29.60
can't have a watch on so you don't even know how fast you're going anyways yeah well that

878
01:32:29.60 --> 01:32:33.12
they were treating you like bud students because in buds you don't have a watch and it's a total

879
01:32:33.12 --> 01:32:36.40
pain in the ass because you never know what you're doing the only thing you can do it just go as hard

880
01:32:36.40 --> 01:32:41.84
as you can because that's the best they can do you know well in selection what I I didn't try to look

881
01:32:41.84 --> 01:32:48.40
too far in advance I just took each activity for it was you know in your viewing beat down and

882
01:32:48.40 --> 01:32:55.44
on our team day the last day of help the kind of hell week I was just like hey Joe just taking

883
01:32:55.44 --> 01:33:01.92
another step just worry about one more step and then we'll worry about the rest later I didn't try

884
01:33:03.04 --> 01:33:09.52
to overwhelm myself you know and I read some things before you know about some different selections

885
01:33:09.52 --> 01:33:16.80
and things and that's one of the things they said don't overwhelm yourself just worry about

886
01:33:16.80 --> 01:33:21.60
one thing at a time and you make it through that well you worry about the next thing then

887
01:33:21.60 --> 01:33:28.48
so you get done so did you do anything besides chaffy?

888
01:33:28.48 --> 01:33:35.52
how does that land warfare with those guys? we went to chaffy and then back to the creek and then

889
01:33:35.52 --> 01:33:41.28
you we culminating you know you're doing FTX's throughout and then it culminates with a final

890
01:33:41.28 --> 01:33:46.56
FTX where you got to hit a target over there and you go in you know what Sims and everything

891
01:33:46.56 --> 01:33:53.44
and they didn't have the the miles gear like we had a nylon there and you know you do a hit

892
01:33:54.48 --> 01:34:00.80
the group I was in we had to fast rope on top of this building at night and it could be tricking

893
01:34:00.80 --> 01:34:06.56
we used our DEA pilots and they hope they can hold a hover good but there was always a couple of times

894
01:34:06.56 --> 01:34:12.88
when guys almost were going down the rope in the ropes not over the building and you know I

895
01:34:12.88 --> 01:34:18.000
was always been a heavy guy if I'm full kid or I was carrying my ego I'm not stopping myself

896
01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.08
on that rope. I was made to you I'm not when I'm going I'm going that rope better be in the right

897
01:34:22.08 --> 01:34:25.84
spot because I'm going to be at the bottom of it in about two seconds and that's that it is funny

898
01:34:25.84 --> 01:34:31.84
when we were doing our fast rope training at little creek and the towers and everything you

899
01:34:31.84 --> 01:34:35.60
know you serve the tower at first and you do your appelling and everything it you know it

900
01:34:35.60 --> 01:34:41.20
just take your time sit down you know and the helicopter you know and then grab the rope and

901
01:34:41.20 --> 01:34:47.60
slowly spin yourself just take your time so when we go and the helicopters in first time to

902
01:34:47.60 --> 01:34:53.36
feel you're like go go go go go go go what happened just take your time thing you're like

903
01:34:53.36 --> 01:34:59.84
effort I guess we're doing it live you know so you get done with that and you said that's when

904
01:34:59.84 --> 01:35:06.96
you actually got selected or chosen to go to a fast what you call the fast companies that's team

905
01:35:06.96 --> 01:35:12.64
fast team so you actually get selected to go to a fast team and that's in the fall of 2009

906
01:35:12.96 --> 01:35:19.12
correct October 2009 and when you get there are you going do you know you're going on

907
01:35:19.12 --> 01:35:26.24
a deployment at a certain time well we knew what team you were going to we had five teams at the time

908
01:35:26.24 --> 01:35:35.92
uh LFO through Echo and each team is made up of one supervisor eight agents in one intel analyst so I

909
01:35:35.92 --> 01:35:43.68
knew a team I was going on then once we got there they would tell you okay we always had a

910
01:35:43.68 --> 01:35:50.08
team in Afghanistan all the time and each deployment lasted 120 days give or take some days and

911
01:35:50.08 --> 01:35:59.28
so you knew when you were going up so once I got there I was assigned to Delta team which was

912
01:35:59.28 --> 01:36:08.08
made up of some senior agents and what some of the newer individuals and we were set to go to

913
01:36:08.08 --> 01:36:18.56
do the the first deployment Afghanistan was going to be the spring summerter of 2010 and a lot of

914
01:36:18.56 --> 01:36:22.96
people don't know in Afghanistan there's a fighting season over there you know as you get

915
01:36:22.96 --> 01:36:27.92
bad weather there it gets winter and stuff like that so in a spring summer that's when all the

916
01:36:27.92 --> 01:36:36.000
fighting is going on and that's when they're harvesting the opium poppy to manufacture the heroin so

917
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:44.16
that's kind of your busy time so you get settled in and you do start doing your pleat of pre-deployment

918
01:36:44.16 --> 01:36:51.76
work up kind of like you know with the military and then we had a group come in you may be familiar

919
01:36:51.76 --> 01:37:01.12
with them they're made up of X Navy special warfare guys and actually some dev group guys called

920
01:37:01.12 --> 01:37:11.84
um shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot the David group okay right off and they actually we actually used

921
01:37:13.76 --> 01:37:20.64
your guys' system and developmental groups of combat clearing okay so they actually taught us in that

922
01:37:20.64 --> 01:37:26.56
and then that's when we're find out before deployments you guys are going to

923
01:37:26.56 --> 01:37:34.64
camp Billy making a nylon California and they're doing land warfare with a west coast seal team right

924
01:37:34.64 --> 01:37:41.44
off right off you know you know what what when was that do you remember when that was E yes

925
01:37:43.76 --> 01:37:51.84
surf on tax seasoncy April May ish of 2010 yeah um as well as I was definitely still there and

926
01:37:51.84 --> 01:37:57.28
ask you T-Cle you weren't there when we first got there you showed up at the end yeah sure for the

927
01:37:57.28 --> 01:38:02.24
after you access yeah that's what I would do and um their SQT was going through there at the time

928
01:38:03.28 --> 01:38:09.20
and um so it was a full house there how was that training it was intense you know it was you know

929
01:38:09.84 --> 01:38:16.72
three weeks day and night of you know getting you know kicked in the balls you know and you know

930
01:38:16.72 --> 01:38:23.76
this is what I was told in the seal pre-deployment workup that's usually the hardest pre-deployment

931
01:38:23.76 --> 01:38:31.28
block of the toughest yeah the land warfare especially at that time was no joke you know so there was

932
01:38:31.28 --> 01:38:38.40
a lot of buddy carrying you know for extreme distances you know you know and you know different things

933
01:38:38.40 --> 01:38:49.44
but I tell you you got to learn how to do you know land warfare drills very effectively you got to

934
01:38:50.64 --> 01:38:57.60
get to know how to use your equipment your night vision your lasers very well you came out of

935
01:38:57.60 --> 01:39:02.72
their well prepared like you know knowing that something happens in combat you know but you you know

936
01:39:02.72 --> 01:39:09.28
you ran out there you know you're training there for worst case scenario you know and so yeah that was

937
01:39:09.28 --> 01:39:17.12
always my goal was that and you know the goal was as crazy as a goal this may seem like the goal was oh okay

938
01:39:18.64 --> 01:39:24.000
I want to make sure that these guys if they get into a gunfight it's they're going to be it's going

939
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.52
to seem easy compared to what they've been through in training and I had countless guys come back

940
01:39:29.52 --> 01:39:33.44
to me and say hey this is the situation we're in here's the gunfight we got in here's the contact

941
01:39:33.44 --> 01:39:40.000
we got in here's the scenario we were in and they were able to handle it exquisitely because the

942
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.28
training the land warfare training that they'd been through and the urban training that they've been

943
01:39:43.28 --> 01:39:50.96
to was so hard that the actual combat seemed easy now obviously can you simulate someone actually

944
01:39:50.96 --> 01:39:55.36
getting wounded or actually getting killed know you can't but as far as especially from a leadership

945
01:39:55.36 --> 01:40:00.000
perspective understanding how to manage all those elements on the battlefield and then the young

946
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.80
shooters being thinking shooters and knowing how to execute knowing how to operate knowing how to

947
01:40:04.80 --> 01:40:10.96
move themselves it's just an awesome package that that you have you have this just unified team when

948
01:40:10.96 --> 01:40:16.48
they get done with those with those training cycle so it was nice because in Nyland you know they

949
01:40:16.48 --> 01:40:20.56
know they broke us up in this intermixed us with the team you know so they put a couple

950
01:40:20.56 --> 01:40:28.000
of you know with this you know fire team that fire team so they kind of mixed in so it was it was

951
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.000
it was very very good training a lot of the the train and stuff there and Nyland was good

952
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:39.52
visit it's very similar to Afghanistan terrain too I was get we were trying we had some some

953
01:40:39.52 --> 01:40:45.68
other military entities trying to get control of that training site for us and I remember I put

954
01:40:45.68 --> 01:40:49.44
together a brief for my leadership in the chain of command my most senior leadership in the chain of

955
01:40:49.44 --> 01:40:56.96
command and what I did was I took pictures of Nyland and pictures of Afghanistan of like seals

956
01:40:56.96 --> 01:41:01.44
patrolling in Nyland and seals patrolling in Afghanistan and I put together like five or six of those

957
01:41:01.44 --> 01:41:06.80
pictures side by side in a slide show and I said this is the terrain we're fighting in and this

958
01:41:06.80 --> 01:41:12.40
is the terrain we're training in we can't do any better than this right here and we need to maintain

959
01:41:12.40 --> 01:41:17.76
control this and so yeah it's it's it's it's very it's almost on candy how similar those two

960
01:41:17.76 --> 01:41:23.36
environments can look and I didn't realize when we were there he had two army Rangers you know doing

961
01:41:23.36 --> 01:41:27.92
an exchange program that he'll teach the land warfare there yep yep you know those those

962
01:41:27.92 --> 01:41:33.28
Rangers that we would bring out their just outstanding guys because we as seals always want to have

963
01:41:33.28 --> 01:41:38.56
an open mind and make sure that we are understanding the tactics the techniques the procedures of

964
01:41:38.56 --> 01:41:42.80
other units what do they know better than us what can they teach us what can we've learned from them

965
01:41:42.80 --> 01:41:47.12
and that's one of the ways that we've always done that is taking individuals from other units

966
01:41:47.12 --> 01:41:51.68
and bringing them to our units especially to our instructor cadre so that we can learn more and

967
01:41:51.68 --> 01:41:56.96
try and get better and those those Rangers that work with us were just outstanding guys and I say

968
01:41:57.52 --> 01:42:03.60
and I feel you guys do an outstanding job of your guys as training you know like you said you know

969
01:42:03.60 --> 01:42:08.32
knowing that hey there's always you know there's more than one way to skin a cat no

970
01:42:08.32 --> 01:42:12.32
and what see what other people are doing you know you you put things in your toolbox and

971
01:42:12.32 --> 01:42:16.24
hey I might use this again or hey I may never use that again but you have a lot of tools in that

972
01:42:16.24 --> 01:42:23.52
toolbox yeah indeed so you end up going on deployment to Afghanistan your first deployment how's that

973
01:42:25.92 --> 01:42:33.76
it's some intense every time we go to Afghanistan things are a little different and at the time

974
01:42:33.76 --> 01:42:42.64
we were doing a lot of work with the Army ODA's the Green Braise there and at this particular time

975
01:42:42.64 --> 01:42:51.12
we were operating in Panjoe area you know the Panjoe of Canada area is kind of the first place of

976
01:42:51.12 --> 01:42:57.60
Taliban where there's a lot of in search and activity but also a lot of heroin production going on

977
01:42:57.60 --> 01:43:05.92
there also so they broke us up into like two z's and three z's input us with different units

978
01:43:05.92 --> 01:43:14.32
and a good partner of mine friend of mine Travis Brooks and myself we were assigned with

979
01:43:15.28 --> 01:43:22.72
first special forces group over there ODA 1231 and they were stationed in Cancemins this

980
01:43:22.72 --> 01:43:28.80
little little base outside of Canada Airfield which is like our main bases that can't

981
01:43:28.80 --> 01:43:36.64
be had our airfield in Afghanistan we were living with the ODA the first group guys you know and we would bring

982
01:43:37.60 --> 01:43:44.24
like I said earlier our expertise investigations and we had our partner force over there which we were

983
01:43:44.24 --> 01:43:51.52
mentoring and we were living over there with the Green Braise and using our intel information

984
01:43:52.08 --> 01:43:58.32
you know from the DEA and also using the military information and we would try to pair

985
01:43:58.32 --> 01:44:06.24
that information find out where the bigger drug labs were where they were selling the chemicals

986
01:44:06.24 --> 01:44:13.44
and equipment to manufacture heroin and we would not go after is the opion farmers the Poppy farmers

987
01:44:13.44 --> 01:44:18.16
because a lot of times they were made to grow the opion you know the Taliban came in and they had

988
01:44:18.16 --> 01:44:21.52
the biggest stick at the time either you know you're growing this Poppy force or you're

989
01:44:21.52 --> 01:44:26.72
can killed you know so we knew they weren't reaping the benefits so we would try to find you know

990
01:44:26.72 --> 01:44:33.60
the people who were getting the money from this and it's called a narco terrorism nexus

991
01:44:35.04 --> 01:44:39.60
and so we would hit these bigger locations and take people off the battlefield and train

992
01:44:39.60 --> 01:44:47.04
to Afghans how to process and how to conduct these you know investigations and we were

993
01:44:48.56 --> 01:44:53.76
with the the Green Braise you had the time they were doing movements to contact

994
01:44:53.76 --> 01:44:59.44
which for the non you know military people and I didn't know at the time because I wasn't in

995
01:44:59.44 --> 01:45:04.40
the military before you know you basically go on a hot air and you pick a fight and you access

996
01:45:04.40 --> 01:45:11.68
us the enemy how strong they are and you stay there for a couple days and then a lot of times

997
01:45:11.68 --> 01:45:18.08
conventional forces are brought in and we were hitting areas where a lot of drug activity was going on

998
01:45:18.08 --> 01:45:28.96
and had of course in panjue at the time they had a lot of implanted iEDs yeah this is 2010 yes

999
01:45:28.96 --> 01:45:33.76
so iED threat is just full on at this time especially in that area you know and that's when they

1000
01:45:33.76 --> 01:45:39.76
started switching over to like the homemade explosive the HME where the metal detectors not picking

1001
01:45:39.76 --> 01:45:46.64
the stuff up you know we had dogs and stuff with the bomb guys and gals but sometimes they couldn't

1002
01:45:46.64 --> 01:45:52.32
smell it and a lot of times these iEDs are hidden so well you can't see where they're at and especially

1003
01:45:52.32 --> 01:45:59.68
at night under knots you know in every mission people were getting you know injured with iEDs you

1004
01:45:59.68 --> 01:46:05.20
know that was you know in a straight up fight most often than not they couldn't hang with us

1005
01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:11.52
you know so they're you know they used their weapon to iED and you know to inflater around us

1006
01:46:11.52 --> 01:46:19.28
and you know it's like okay this is gonna be my last step i have my legs you know you're trying to

1007
01:46:19.28 --> 01:46:25.68
do everything to try to you know mitigate it but you know you still never never know so you know we're

1008
01:46:25.68 --> 01:46:31.12
doing these movements to contact and you know we're most often the knot hitting these labs behind

1009
01:46:31.12 --> 01:46:38.80
enemy lab lines and that's their money they're fighting like hell to keep it you know so i think that

1010
01:46:38.80 --> 01:46:46.32
first year i think i did if we did about 11 missions or so and it was like two times i didn't have

1011
01:46:46.32 --> 01:46:55.60
to fire my gun and i carried a belt fed weapon at the time i showed up the fast the course

1012
01:46:55.60 --> 01:47:00.48
the listeners can't see i'm a decent sized guy what are you walking around out at that time weightwise

1013
01:47:00.48 --> 01:47:06.64
um two thirty-ish so they're giving you a belt fed well yes you're like you're a big guy you carry

1014
01:47:06.64 --> 01:47:13.04
i'm saying i'm old and it's still heavy you know carry a mark 48 or mark 46 actually i'm mark 43

1015
01:47:13.04 --> 01:47:20.08
oh damn okay you know old school m60 m4 that's crazy you know and that was made you know for you guys you

1016
01:47:20.08 --> 01:47:28.64
know you know um we had mark 48's but i'm a left-handed rifle shooter i'm almost all jacked up

1017
01:47:28.64 --> 01:47:34.16
i was ready left eye dominant and i shot a pistol right handed in that mark 48 you eat all the

1018
01:47:34.16 --> 01:47:39.68
brass and link the mark 43 was a little better you i put like a broomstick handle on the front and i

1019
01:47:39.68 --> 01:47:47.12
moved away back and i get stand stand up and i tuck my right elbow real far in and so i wouldn't

1020
01:47:47.12 --> 01:47:53.44
catch as much Lincoln brass you know the cyclic rate of fire i'm at mark 43's not quite as fast as the

1021
01:47:53.44 --> 01:48:00.64
48 but as you know it's it's it's a pretty reliable it's a it's a reliable weapon you know so i

1022
01:48:00.64 --> 01:48:07.28
carried that damn thing every remission you know it's nice to have because it does a lot of damage

1023
01:48:08.32 --> 01:48:14.48
but as uh automatic gunner the enemy knows that so you're a target too hundred percent you know

1024
01:48:14.48 --> 01:48:21.04
in tracers work both ways they do and luckily at night i got a hold of some of the i-r tracers

1025
01:48:21.04 --> 01:48:25.92
okay which you can only see under naz and usually the enemy did not you know for the most part

1026
01:48:25.92 --> 01:48:35.44
and at there they did not have night vision capabilities so yeah it was um you had to you fire

1027
01:48:35.44 --> 01:48:39.20
and you move your position a little bit and you fire move your position a little bit and you know

1028
01:48:39.20 --> 01:48:44.64
it's not like TV you know that you had a box of a hundred rounds on that you gun and it doesn't

1029
01:48:44.64 --> 01:48:50.64
last for five minutes you know if you're hammering that trigger down it's goes pretty quick so you

1030
01:48:50.64 --> 01:48:55.68
gotta learn to conserve your ammo and spread load ammo with other people too well you going out with

1031
01:48:55.68 --> 01:49:00.24
so you're going out with an ODA team at this time yes and you also would have afghan partners with

1032
01:49:00.24 --> 01:49:05.60
you yes so these are pretty big elements that you're going out of yes and the ODA had their um

1033
01:49:05.60 --> 01:49:13.28
partner force too oh so wait so you guys had your own partner force yes wow like a DEA and afghan

1034
01:49:13.28 --> 01:49:19.20
DEA yes it's the national introduction unit okay um the afghans they were more their

1035
01:49:19.20 --> 01:49:25.92
investigators and then the green braze or ever group they had their own group too right which the

1036
01:49:25.92 --> 01:49:31.76
um green braze like to use the afghan commandos that was kind of like their special ops unit

1037
01:49:32.40 --> 01:49:37.04
you know but it's to be quite honest with you even like we were working with the best in brightest

1038
01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.72
it was like hurting cats oh for sure yeah you know it's like okay you know what's you know you

1039
01:49:42.72 --> 01:49:49.84
couldn't do these advance like um wedge and echelon movement I was like single file those get in line

1040
01:49:49.84 --> 01:49:54.48
and we hope you can stay in line get in line in please stay in line and stay behind the bomb people

1041
01:49:54.48 --> 01:50:00.56
and listen that you know don't walk on like the path this is look like people walk the most don't

1042
01:50:00.56 --> 01:50:05.28
go over the foot bridges but that's where we're gonna place the i.e.s and within 10 minutes on the ground

1043
01:50:05.28 --> 01:50:10.56
they're everywhere oh my oh Jesus they're gonna get me blown up you how big would these elements

1044
01:50:10.56 --> 01:50:17.04
be so you got the odi team the commandos your guys and then the the afghan d a whatever you call them

1045
01:50:17.04 --> 01:50:24.64
yes what are you talking like you got like 50 people yeah it depends how big the operation is you know

1046
01:50:24.64 --> 01:50:31.28
a green braid odi team we got like 12 individuals and they're partner force probably you would

1047
01:50:31.28 --> 01:50:38.56
be around 30 you know and fast um because we were like two season three zes have a two to four fast

1048
01:50:38.56 --> 01:50:45.12
agents and we would bring our partner force at this particular time like we could cherry pick people

1049
01:50:45.92 --> 01:50:52.24
that were the better um fighters and um sometimes two to four we would take out and

1050
01:50:52.24 --> 01:50:58.16
did be honest like I said we worked the best in brightest not a high percentage of them were

1051
01:50:58.16 --> 01:51:04.48
good fighters and a lot of times they weren't in great shape so we're kind of limited what

1052
01:51:04.48 --> 01:51:13.60
you can do how long of an infill and ex-fill you can do and how complicated a plan you could do so

1053
01:51:13.60 --> 01:51:21.20
you know it kind of hamstringed us a little bit you know but we went out there in got the job done

1054
01:51:21.76 --> 01:51:26.72
you know when we were really hitting them hard you know they call it second third order effects

1055
01:51:26.72 --> 01:51:31.04
you could see they were having trouble getting some more of the better munitions and stuff

1056
01:51:31.04 --> 01:51:39.76
um when we were like this you know putting a smack down on them and um halfway through that

1057
01:51:39.76 --> 01:51:45.84
first oh they had the end of that first order we had first group was leaving and then a group from

1058
01:51:45.84 --> 01:51:54.48
third group came in ODA 3116 and they came in and we did a couple missions with them and

1059
01:51:54.48 --> 01:52:00.96
I know you're probably familiar with this and some of the listeners you know that the Afghans

1060
01:52:01.68 --> 01:52:06.96
they use these icon radios to talk with each other and we intercept these things you know a lot

1061
01:52:06.96 --> 01:52:11.20
times they're just talking shit on these damn things you know we're killing them you know the

1062
01:52:11.20 --> 01:52:15.68
marriage they're dying know we found your idea and we're blowing it up you know that's what you just

1063
01:52:15.68 --> 01:52:24.40
heard and you know so we're getting at the end of our tour and we're gonna hit the spot

1064
01:52:24.40 --> 01:52:33.76
um called Hazi Medott in Afghanistan and there was a little combat outpost out there

1065
01:52:34.56 --> 01:52:40.24
which I think the hundred and first airborne was out there and they had a Taliban hospital in the

1066
01:52:40.24 --> 01:52:46.08
area and of course they were growing a lot of marijuana and poppy seed out there and but they also had

1067
01:52:46.08 --> 01:52:52.48
several dish goes into areas the enemy did and that's the old like Russian anti-aircraft weaponry

1068
01:52:52.48 --> 01:53:02.56
51 and they would harass the coalition forces their air so you know we had several tasks in this

1069
01:53:02.56 --> 01:53:08.48
mission you know the fine drug you know the eradicate some of the drug activity going on and also find these

1070
01:53:08.48 --> 01:53:15.60
dishgoss so the rainders went in there before us and they got in a pretty good dust up and tick

1071
01:53:15.60 --> 01:53:23.04
stands for troops in contact and they lost a couple of Rangers so we were going in a couple of days after

1072
01:53:23.04 --> 01:53:29.44
and you're doing your pre-mission briefing and you know we're gonna get inserted with you know

1073
01:53:29.44 --> 01:53:36.56
three CH47 and four CH47 helicopters and there's a high probability we're gonna lose

1074
01:53:37.28 --> 01:53:41.92
a helicopter on infill with the dish goes and you know you're sitting in the night before you

1075
01:53:41.92 --> 01:53:48.72
oh shit I hope it's not me you're like a coffin up there you know even most time when we flew

1076
01:53:48.72 --> 01:53:55.28
with the the green braise they used like to use the night stalkers in one sixty it and we would

1077
01:53:55.28 --> 01:54:01.28
always infill an ex-fill with a spectrogunship overhead you know but still that's not any guarantees

1078
01:54:02.56 --> 01:54:07.28
and so you said night before I hope it's not me you know it was not our helicopter to get shot down

1079
01:54:07.28 --> 01:54:17.68
so we plan this up and we infill we usually like to go in at night to use the our our advantage

1080
01:54:17.68 --> 01:54:22.24
whether technology were the night vision and later lasers because I stated earlier the enemy

1081
01:54:22.24 --> 01:54:29.44
usually doesn't have that so we like to go in at night get a foothold the best we can and then

1082
01:54:29.44 --> 01:54:34.56
when it's light search and then you know ex-fill the next day or depending how long the

1083
01:54:34.56 --> 01:54:42.40
mission's gonna last you know a day or two or whatnot so we fly in and we take a little incoming

1084
01:54:42.40 --> 01:54:51.44
fire but all four birds make it so we begin to sweep through and get a foothold and then

1085
01:54:52.64 --> 01:54:59.20
for individuals are listening that you know it's been over there usually they'll try to hit or

1086
01:54:59.20 --> 01:55:05.68
probe you the enemy over there after first after morning prayer and then you see they do their first hit

1087
01:55:07.12 --> 01:55:16.88
try to feel you out so we get in a couple little skirmishes see him plan some i.e. ds and

1088
01:55:17.76 --> 01:55:23.92
you know we're okay we're moving through and we didn't find where we were at we didn't find the

1089
01:55:23.92 --> 01:55:29.92
discos we're gonna find some marijuana fields in this and that throughout the day they're talking

1090
01:55:29.92 --> 01:55:35.44
you're like we need to find a good place to set up our p.k.m machine guns meaning the enemy

1091
01:55:36.64 --> 01:55:41.28
and you know we blew up an i.d. and like I said already you know oh we are killing them you know

1092
01:55:41.28 --> 01:55:47.04
we're you know the Americans are screaming and so you know they're you know setting up their p.k.

1093
01:55:47.04 --> 01:55:54.32
you know so like okay you're just but you're bullshit whatever screw you so this is an august

1094
01:55:55.28 --> 01:56:03.04
and it's high to sell and we didn't have any close airs ports at the time was they got

1095
01:56:03.04 --> 01:56:10.16
called over to some other units that were having some contact so we had a predator overhead

1096
01:56:10.16 --> 01:56:16.56
but the predators wings i stole over and had the land you know this is you know 115 degree you know

1097
01:56:16.56 --> 01:56:22.08
it's 10 degrees but I you know you they're flying up higher and I don't know the specifics and stuff so

1098
01:56:23.44 --> 01:56:31.84
you know we're in sporadic scrimmishes so we were under fire so they're like um we're not

1099
01:56:31.84 --> 01:56:37.76
going to send air to pick you up because the l.s. is pretty you're going to be pretty hot so you're

1100
01:56:37.76 --> 01:56:42.000
going to have to make it we're going to have to try to make it to this combat outpost over there

1101
01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:52.96
which was probably a couple clicks away at the time so we moved out and we stopped this little

1102
01:56:52.96 --> 01:57:00.32
like villageria and we get set up to make our final push and it was just the villagers there

1103
01:57:02.40 --> 01:57:07.36
just had it just we had a funny sense and like a spider is something something's not right

1104
01:57:07.36 --> 01:57:15.20
you know you know we get in there where your IDs how we do not know where they are okay so okay

1105
01:57:15.20 --> 01:57:21.20
you're going to go on front of us and you're going to take us through you know and you get to spot

1106
01:57:21.60 --> 01:57:26.24
I will not go any further you must kill me oh I thought you don't know where the IDs were you know

1107
01:57:26.24 --> 01:57:31.76
so we found a couple IDs and bloom up and so where the termination is made we're going to make

1108
01:57:31.76 --> 01:57:37.92
it to the combat outpost so at this time we're probably about clicking a half away or so

1109
01:57:39.76 --> 01:57:47.52
so we're moving through this is daylight and we're in a single file and one of our guys see some

1110
01:57:47.52 --> 01:57:53.20
movements in this little hot above us and he's like tells one of the green braise hey I think

1111
01:57:53.20 --> 01:58:00.08
I saw some movement so he glasses it with his scope and doesn't see anything so we're moving out

1112
01:58:00.08 --> 01:58:07.12
and I'm next to like a pony wall like a probably a couple foot pony wall to my right of me

1113
01:58:07.76 --> 01:58:11.52
and I tell you one thing those old mud buildings like when you're over there there's mud uh

1114
01:58:12.64 --> 01:58:17.12
you can explain to people and bless you over there you can't believe people still lift like this

1115
01:58:17.12 --> 01:58:24.72
but those those things do a hell job stopping bullets and stuff so we're going through and then

1116
01:58:24.72 --> 01:58:31.04
sure is shit they were looking for a place to step to pee camps we got caught in a near ambush

1117
01:58:32.72 --> 01:58:40.32
so I got bullets going over my head coming to the side of me and people are caught off we got

1118
01:58:40.32 --> 01:58:47.28
four people hit right off the bat when the ambush opened one being the ODA team sergeant and he's like

1119
01:58:47.28 --> 01:58:58.16
I got a formal bleed and we're like oh shit so I'm rocking my 43 and I usually care about

1120
01:58:58.16 --> 01:59:06.000
400 rounds of ammo on me and we had spread loaded some more and so you know I'm trying to pick

1121
01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:11.92
up like puffs a smoke or I think enemy fires coming from but I'm also trying to conserve some of

1122
01:59:11.92 --> 01:59:17.12
my ammo too because we start getting overrun I want to have some but I always carry to pistol with me

1123
01:59:17.12 --> 01:59:22.08
too and at least one frag grenade because if I could help I wasn't you know I'm going to fight to

1124
01:59:22.08 --> 01:59:29.76
that I'm not I don't want to be taken alive and so I'm rocking through ammo and being the near

1125
01:59:29.76 --> 01:59:34.96
ambush you know people are throwing hand grenades it was that close you know firing law rockets

1126
01:59:34.96 --> 01:59:44.24
and I asked one of our Afghan counterparks who's both English and the ODA counterparts they

1127
01:59:44.24 --> 01:59:55.76
carried the full length 240 bravos so it's the same round at the mark 43 was fire so I'm like

1128
01:59:55.76 --> 02:00:01.44
go get me some ammo so he runs out and brings you back a little link ammo about 20 bravos like

1129
02:00:01.44 --> 02:00:09.12
what am I gonna do with this so I just link it one of my belts so that's okay and so we're

1130
02:00:09.12 --> 02:00:16.000
fighting and we finally get some close air support we get a f16 from the UAE but they won't fire

1131
02:00:17.28 --> 02:00:23.04
and you know we got people hit and we got in the meta-vac coming in and I tell you those

1132
02:00:23.04 --> 02:00:28.80
meta-vac pilots have balls of steel when they come and they started coming in RPGs were shooting

1133
02:00:28.80 --> 02:00:34.88
up all around them they landed those birds and got our most severely wounded people out of there

1134
02:00:35.84 --> 02:00:43.84
and you know back to you know higher care you know so we finally get some close air support

1135
02:00:43.84 --> 02:00:49.36
to suppress it a little bit the hundred and first here's all this activity going out so they

1136
02:00:49.36 --> 02:00:56.000
bring some of their gun trucks but they can't get too close to us so we're like okay we got a

1137
02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:01.60
you know we're getting a little break so like okay we got to make it this combat outpost so we did

1138
02:01:03.04 --> 02:01:08.32
our vote our version of the Mogadisha mile there where you know you're running and shooting

1139
02:01:09.12 --> 02:01:13.52
and you're not caring about the IED's at this time we had the cross-open feel and I guess you know

1140
02:01:13.52 --> 02:01:18.48
you're up you see me I'm down you know I guess if I step on some shit I guess I'm gonna blow up

1141
02:01:19.04 --> 02:01:24.16
and you know they get their gun trucks out there and they start shooting in some press of fire

1142
02:01:24.16 --> 02:01:30.64
and we ended up getting to the combat outposts and of course we look all look like soup sandwiches

1143
02:01:31.36 --> 02:01:35.04
you know I'm done here it was like you guys were out there you go yeah

1144
02:01:36.08 --> 02:01:41.52
I learned in a combat you know we got stationed you know set there and you know got some rest and

1145
02:01:42.32 --> 02:01:46.32
we're gonna go to the Chahong get some food and that's when I learned most of the bases we were staying at

1146
02:01:46.32 --> 02:01:52.72
the unlimited food and that's when I learned to combat outposts just limited rations you know you only get

1147
02:01:52.72 --> 02:01:59.76
you know what's there little serving you know so grace of God everybody ended up surviving you know we

1148
02:01:59.76 --> 02:02:06.96
had some some injuries but we ended up surviving so that concluded my turn and I tell you what I

1149
02:02:06.96 --> 02:02:10.56
had a bat you know I thought it was gonna end that day because when you come close to running

1150
02:02:10.56 --> 02:02:17.84
ammo you'd like oh shit you know what tell them what to do you know so it was it was quite

1151
02:02:17.84 --> 02:02:25.44
inexperienced so we kind of went out with went out in a bang that first her yeah sorry yeah you

1152
02:02:25.84 --> 02:02:30.000
definitely seemed to end that deployment with a bang when you when you got done with that deployment

1153
02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:35.92
as you looked back at it what were some of the takeaways that you got from your experiences there

1154
02:02:37.20 --> 02:02:43.84
like anything I've done in life okay every mission I would take it for each mission it's like okay

1155
02:02:43.84 --> 02:02:49.28
these are the things I did right in the mission these are things I want to do the same again

1156
02:02:49.28 --> 02:02:54.48
and these are the things I did wrong I never want to do again so each thing you know I looked at

1157
02:02:54.48 --> 02:02:59.60
myself critically I've always been probably my own worst critic these you know I don't want to do

1158
02:02:59.60 --> 02:03:06.32
that ever again you know and this is what I want to do and you can probably relate and some of our

1159
02:03:06.32 --> 02:03:12.08
listeners probably the more you're in that environment you never get 100% used to it but you get

1160
02:03:12.08 --> 02:03:19.52
calmer during it I remember my very first operation it's oh dark 30 you know with the green

1161
02:03:19.52 --> 02:03:25.36
rays that year and lucky we didn't get any a ticks or anything is I remember landing in the middle

1162
02:03:25.36 --> 02:03:31.04
of the night in the middle of nowhere and I guess I said I guess it's just for real now

1163
02:03:31.76 --> 02:03:36.000
you know I'm just trying to make sure I don't lose my element and night being a night vision it's

1164
02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.40
you know it's not the easiest to see you know you know and we had some pretty decent night vision

1165
02:03:40.40 --> 02:03:45.44
it's like please please Lord let me keep up with the people in my group but not get lost out here

1166
02:03:45.44 --> 02:03:53.60
by myself so you know and I told I was talking to my fellow some fellow agents back in Arizona when

1167
02:03:53.60 --> 02:03:59.28
I got back and I was telling them stories you know this is what we're doing you know you're like oh

1168
02:03:59.28 --> 02:04:04.80
you're bullshitting there's no way you did that shit I'm like oh yeah we did you know it's

1169
02:04:04.80 --> 02:04:10.000
common you know everything kind of fell in the place where I don't know if it ever will happen again

1170
02:04:10.72 --> 02:04:17.44
you're at war with a country that has a drug nexus you know so it's I did things as a DA agent

1171
02:04:17.44 --> 02:04:22.80
I never thought in a million years I'd be doing and you know people would ask me would you

1172
02:04:22.80 --> 02:04:30.56
scare it or nervous I said yeah how yeah I was you know I said but you still had a job to do you know

1173
02:04:30.56 --> 02:04:35.44
there's nothing you know scary or feeling you're going to land you know you're giving you know

1174
02:04:35.44 --> 02:04:39.84
five minutes two minutes and you hear the door gunners open up you know you're going into a hot

1175
02:04:39.84 --> 02:04:46.000
LZ you know you had to unassus burning you know so I put in some fire down but I explained

1176
02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:50.24
it to it's like at the amusement park you ride in the biggest baddest roller coaster you're

1177
02:04:50.24 --> 02:04:56.40
scared nervous and then when you get done it's like okay when we go back again you know I guess

1178
02:04:56.40 --> 02:05:01.68
I got I get that warp sense you know I've always been kind of an adrenaline junkie but

1179
02:05:02.32 --> 02:05:10.24
you know it's like are you nuts I don't know if I'm nuts but you know I tend to I've always even

1180
02:05:10.24 --> 02:05:18.72
football tend to excel when the pressure was on you know some people fold under pressure some

1181
02:05:18.72 --> 02:05:26.80
people can handle it well luckily for me I always had a neck of being able to still function pretty

1182
02:05:26.80 --> 02:05:34.08
effectively under stress when you got home from that deployment you said you went back to Arizona

1183
02:05:34.08 --> 02:05:39.20
do you know back to uh quantum code okay so you got back to quantum code yes so is that where you're

1184
02:05:39.20 --> 02:05:44.72
actually living now is in quantum code since you're with the fast team well I'm retired now but when I was

1185
02:05:44.72 --> 02:05:50.08
on the fast team yes I was living in the quantum area I was living actually in Frederick's bird

1186
02:05:50.08 --> 02:05:55.28
Virginia okay so you get back from that deployment no one can believe what you did you can

1187
02:05:55.28 --> 02:05:59.76
barely believe what you did I'm just lucky to make it out there with my life you know and have

1188
02:05:59.76 --> 02:06:07.76
two legs still you know and then what's next you get it you get to decompress you know you get

1189
02:06:07.76 --> 02:06:13.84
to spend time with your family you know you've been going a while they send the the psychologists in

1190
02:06:13.84 --> 02:06:20.48
and they kind of debrief you and see if you have any issues or problems and you just get to take

1191
02:06:20.48 --> 02:06:25.68
it easy for a while and to spend time with your family and just relax and recoup a rage

1192
02:06:26.48 --> 02:06:32.64
and how long is that decompression time you know you see a month or so nice you know and so then

1193
02:06:32.64 --> 02:06:39.04
you know we were scheduled to do our next tour in Afghanistan it was going to be the late early

1194
02:06:39.04 --> 02:06:47.92
winter tour of 2011 and the meantime we started operating in the western hemisphere also

1195
02:06:48.80 --> 02:06:57.04
and we had a team out there echo team which their primary thing was to western hemisphere

1196
02:06:57.04 --> 02:07:03.44
and they were given us language training and Spanish and everything and they were operating in

1197
02:07:03.44 --> 02:07:11.04
Honduras real shit hole too. Rohitans real nice you know the scuba diving destination is up

1198
02:07:11.04 --> 02:07:18.40
but the rest of the country is a disaster a lot of a lot of violence there so echo teams going there

1199
02:07:18.40 --> 02:07:25.60
and they're doing which is called these air tracks of interest and we were working in conjunction with

1200
02:07:25.60 --> 02:07:32.88
Joyce joint task force bravo over there out of soda cano and what we're looking for is the small

1201
02:07:32.88 --> 02:07:39.36
like planes these sessnows and different things coming from source countries and like cocaine

1202
02:07:39.36 --> 02:07:43.84
Peru itself like that loaded with cocaine you know multiple hundred kilos of co-gattotime

1203
02:07:44.80 --> 02:07:52.08
and you know they would fly in and land in these remote landing strips and their so-called

1204
02:07:52.08 --> 02:07:58.24
remote land was like a road or just like a clearing and they would come in there at night with no

1205
02:07:58.24 --> 02:08:07.44
no night vision and no runway lights you just have like things lit up and land and you know try to

1206
02:08:08.72 --> 02:08:14.96
safely land the plane but the drug dealers didn't really long as the the cocaine was okay

1207
02:08:14.96 --> 02:08:21.60
then care of the plane got destroyed so we were we were sent to they need to volunteer so me and

1208
02:08:21.60 --> 02:08:31.84
another guy from my team volunteered to go and help them out so we go and we're in soda cano we

1209
02:08:31.84 --> 02:08:39.28
doing training with our partner force there getting up to speed and our tactics how to take down

1210
02:08:39.28 --> 02:08:45.20
plane land and take down a plane and all that jazz and we're going to join task force bravo

1211
02:08:45.20 --> 02:08:55.04
and right before we got there we were doing some training so another team went there they

1212
02:08:55.04 --> 02:09:00.72
had one of these air tracks come in and they launched on it and actually got a pretty good firefight

1213
02:09:00.72 --> 02:09:06.08
and they're actually were shooting RPGs at the you know the military aircraft the 47 is

1214
02:09:06.08 --> 02:09:11.68
that were bringing them in and the jade don't have to be a bravo guy so like whoa whoa

1215
02:09:11.68 --> 02:09:16.32
tight time out you know we're just supposed to drive you guys a minor transportation roll we don't

1216
02:09:16.32 --> 02:09:22.56
really want to be in the combat here so when we got there they made a pretty good seizure and killed

1217
02:09:22.56 --> 02:09:30.24
some you know decent amount of enemy and so we get there so they're like and like well okay we

1218
02:09:30.24 --> 02:09:35.84
have to have so many hours of training and you know we have to practice this and that and so we're

1219
02:09:35.84 --> 02:09:41.92
practicing and doing all that you know waiting to go and then DEA we bring some of our air airing

1220
02:09:41.92 --> 02:09:47.44
assets there but we just have smaller vehicles a smaller aircraft like kind of like a super

1221
02:09:47.44 --> 02:09:51.68
black hawk you can't fit a bunch of people in there and we were you know you're doing a saw you

1222
02:09:51.68 --> 02:09:59.12
want like a CH47 or something so they're making every excuse in the world not to fly us

1223
02:10:00.32 --> 02:10:05.60
and was this for a specific target that you're going after? um oh was it just in general they

1224
02:10:05.60 --> 02:10:10.64
were making excuses not to fly or if a hit happen to come up in general okay because they knew

1225
02:10:11.20 --> 02:10:17.92
that was going to be gunplay and um one of our hunter and partner forces got shot during that

1226
02:10:17.92 --> 02:10:24.16
first operation they had to met a vac a my out and they're like if we've sent you guys down there

1227
02:10:24.16 --> 02:10:31.84
and if somebody gets hurt we are not flying into what hot LZ to get you so there's a lot of

1228
02:10:31.84 --> 02:10:38.32
things so we had two DEA aircraft there so we had a couple good air tracks to came up so the first one

1229
02:10:39.44 --> 02:10:45.28
we launched just what our DEA birds and the amount of fuel then carry is not that great so you can't

1230
02:10:45.28 --> 02:10:53.36
be up that long and it takes a while for us to get on these these these bogey birds

1231
02:10:54.40 --> 02:11:01.36
and get tracking them um so we launched and we had um in each one of these helicopter two DEA pilots

1232
02:11:01.36 --> 02:11:09.44
we had two fast team guys and two hunter and partner forces and these birds and each one of these birds

1233
02:11:09.44 --> 02:11:18.08
we had a full size 240 Bravo on there in stuff but with that limited people you're not going to land

1234
02:11:18.08 --> 02:11:23.12
in fight a force so at best we hoped to see where they land and hey if we got harassed and

1235
02:11:23.12 --> 02:11:27.60
maybe you know you could defend yourself and put some fire down at least to say about the aircraft

1236
02:11:27.60 --> 02:11:36.96
so we launched twice and we get on both tracks but before they landed we had to we were

1237
02:11:36.96 --> 02:11:44.16
running uh blowing and running low and fuel so we had to get back so we're there and we're staying

1238
02:11:44.16 --> 02:11:49.12
out at Porta Castillo near the Porta Castillo area there's a base out there that's we're launching from

1239
02:11:50.48 --> 02:11:55.68
so they had it was a pretty big media event so they all knew we were the

1240
02:11:55.68 --> 02:12:02.64
excuse me they all knew we were there so one of the local drug dealers he knows where

1241
02:12:02.64 --> 02:12:08.72
coming so he leaves the country so one of his people that works on him one of his lieutenant's

1242
02:12:08.72 --> 02:12:17.12
is there so he cocks his hair brain scheme he's going to get DEA out of there DEA's

1243
02:12:17.12 --> 02:12:24.16
we're going to get them out of there so my boss can come back so we're staying in this hotel

1244
02:12:24.16 --> 02:12:28.56
so we're at one of the local drug dealers says to himself I'm going to get the DEA to leave

1245
02:12:28.56 --> 02:12:33.20
yes so the big boss may come back the big boss may not have they can come back got it

1246
02:12:34.08 --> 02:12:40.96
so we're staying in this hotel and there's off the water there and um there's another hotel

1247
02:12:40.96 --> 02:12:44.96
there the Christopher Columbus were a lot of the military guys are staying and they had just

1248
02:12:44.96 --> 02:12:49.76
little air strip there so a lot of those fast guys are getting morning and do PT and we'd run

1249
02:12:49.76 --> 02:12:56.88
in the morning so this guy scheme was they knew a kind of our schedule that they were going to

1250
02:12:57.52 --> 02:13:02.40
when we got running the morning they're going to go and drive up and shoot a couple of us down

1251
02:13:03.36 --> 02:13:08.72
so they're going to kill a couple de agents and dea's just going to leave and wait you got

1252
02:13:08.72 --> 02:13:12.88
wind of this or this is just what their plan is you found out after the final we end up getting wind of

1253
02:13:12.88 --> 02:13:19.60
it because one of the partner force guys we were working from recognized a guy

1254
02:13:19.60 --> 02:13:29.28
in town and he said this guy in town got recruited to help kill a couple of us so key reports back

1255
02:13:30.24 --> 02:13:36.08
he approached us to his buddy and they come to us and the two people they're going to kill in the

1256
02:13:36.08 --> 02:13:42.24
morning is the big guy which is me and then another guy in our team Dave Klaus and the guy with

1257
02:13:42.24 --> 02:13:47.44
the funny shorts busy as he's like colorful long goofy shorts he would wear to run and they're

1258
02:13:47.44 --> 02:13:54.08
just going to pull up alongside of us and his machine gun is down so we get wind of this and then

1259
02:13:54.08 --> 02:14:02.000
they get us the hell out of there back to Soda Kano and send us back to the states what about the

1260
02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:07.12
other dea agents they were there like another week and they'd be left it was just there was

1261
02:14:07.12 --> 02:14:11.36
it was at the end of where we're going to leave anyways and plus it's high risk low reward high

1262
02:14:11.36 --> 02:14:19.04
risk low reward JTA problems not flying us so it was just it was this the mess we later went

1263
02:14:19.04 --> 02:14:24.000
back there and had full support and ended doing some good with some of some other teams how

1264
02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:28.16
did you feel when you were trying to get out of there walking from the freaking hotel to the

1265
02:14:28.16 --> 02:14:32.64
car to the airport to get you out of there I tell you what you know we're staying in this hotel

1266
02:14:32.64 --> 02:14:41.12
um Kasa Alamane house a German um by the water there and you know we got I got a first full

1267
02:14:41.12 --> 02:14:47.76
room and it's a decent size room so I'm like get to them one night there so I'm like barricaded my door

1268
02:14:47.76 --> 02:14:54.96
I got my Mark 43 setup ready to go my you know my car being ready to go I'm like okay Lord

1269
02:14:54.96 --> 02:14:59.52
get me through this night I said if they're gonna get me they're gonna have to they're gonna have to work to get me

1270
02:14:59.52 --> 02:15:04.80
you know so it was we were able to sleep or just stay awake all night thank you wrong the

1271
02:15:04.80 --> 02:15:11.12
side of the car and just leave you know I had you know the belt you know down the feed tray

1272
02:15:11.12 --> 02:15:18.000
cover shot you know you know the weapon cock bag but the safety on you know ready ready to go

1273
02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:22.80
you know so they're gonna you know I'm gonna respond with a burst of gunfire they try to get

1274
02:15:22.80 --> 02:15:30.000
through here you know so it was like you know you know I survived Afghanistan and then I'm gonna get

1275
02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:37.60
um I'm gonna get hit in Honduras you know who's coming coming home like oh god Joe what are you

1276
02:15:37.60 --> 02:15:42.32
what are you getting yourself into and you're volunteering for all this and at night in Honduras

1277
02:15:42.32 --> 02:15:50.40
at night they would be all this you know fully automatic AK 47 gunfire and the couple who

1278
02:15:50.40 --> 02:15:56.80
ran to hotel that just like celebratory fire or what is there fights going on I think a little bit

1279
02:15:56.80 --> 02:16:01.36
of both and the people who were the preparators of the hotel said oh they're just killing

1280
02:16:01.36 --> 02:16:06.56
chickens and killing old damn chickens in the middle of the night with AK's yeah be nothing left

1281
02:16:06.56 --> 02:16:16.000
of the chicken you know so we roll back into the states and then we're doing our pre-deployment

1282
02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:25.92
training um getting ready to go to my next turn Afghanistan so again we're in the fighting season

1283
02:16:27.36 --> 02:16:35.44
you know time frame parameter and you know working with the specialized special ops units

1284
02:16:36.24 --> 02:16:43.68
if you had to work with them before and you can probably know this there's a lot of Dick

1285
02:16:43.68 --> 02:16:50.88
measuring going out check it's like who are you what can you do if they never work with you you

1286
02:16:50.88 --> 02:16:56.32
know you know we weren't a special option it for say you know we're the best at DEA have

1287
02:16:56.32 --> 02:17:02.48
but we could shoot moving communicate pretty good you know we could hold our own so a lot of times

1288
02:17:03.04 --> 02:17:08.000
it took two or three missions are going out with people hey these guys are pretty good you know

1289
02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:14.64
they're decent um so a lot of people thought that we going with these units and they would

1290
02:17:14.64 --> 02:17:18.80
clear it and then we would come in after the fact that wasn't the case we erupt there for

1291
02:17:18.80 --> 02:17:27.44
the front leading elements um so to get to my points we had our fast team before us that was there

1292
02:17:29.04 --> 02:17:34.48
in Afghanistan and at the time a lot of the U.S. special ops units were doing these

1293
02:17:34.48 --> 02:17:39.68
Phil's stability programs where they were going out and living with the people out you know

1294
02:17:39.68 --> 02:17:46.72
in the villages and getting them to kind of see our way of thinking and views and values and

1295
02:17:46.72 --> 02:17:51.84
you know we could talk for hours just about that but we won't get into that here today

1296
02:17:53.44 --> 02:17:53.84
so

1297
02:17:57.12 --> 02:18:02.64
no U.S. special ops units were available to direct action missions so the Australian

1298
02:18:02.64 --> 02:18:07.92
Commandos stepped up hey we'll do it and they were operating they could only operate in the

1299
02:18:07.92 --> 02:18:13.68
Helman province in Afghanistan and that's a pretty hot in Surgeon Area Surgeon Area of

1300
02:18:13.68 --> 02:18:18.64
Activity and they have a lot of drug production goes on there and that's where we have a big

1301
02:18:18.64 --> 02:18:26.72
base or camp levelling neck with the Marine Corps is so they were working our fast team came in

1302
02:18:26.72 --> 02:18:32.96
and they saw we were good to go so when we got there we didn't have to go through all that

1303
02:18:32.96 --> 02:18:39.36
rigmarole we just hit the ground running in fact the second op we did there that

1304
02:18:39.36 --> 02:18:46.56
turned we hit the biggest heroin lab to date at that point of time in Afghanistan and it was

1305
02:18:46.56 --> 02:18:53.92
just huge and they weren't used to us being in Helman so we weren't running into a lot of

1306
02:18:53.92 --> 02:19:01.52
in place to IEDs because they weren't used to us being there but they were still putting up a

1307
02:19:01.52 --> 02:19:10.32
hell of a fight you know if you're trying to take their money and oh hell no so we hit that huge

1308
02:19:10.32 --> 02:19:19.04
lab we had how big is that lab like like is it they're producing at a time multiple hundred

1309
02:19:19.04 --> 02:19:26.40
hundred kilos of heroin at a time and in fact when we came in they had a lot of a drying out

1310
02:19:27.04 --> 02:19:32.24
we didn't know and you know the rotor wash of those seeds blew a lot of it away but there is

1311
02:19:32.24 --> 02:19:39.84
a ton of chemicals and equipment left you know then we you know we can't take all the stuff with us so

1312
02:19:39.84 --> 02:19:45.44
we we just take representative samples take photographs and destroy the rest of this stuff in place so

1313
02:19:45.44 --> 02:19:51.76
we're you know in the process of destroying the stuff and we're running into a sporadic you know

1314
02:19:52.48 --> 02:19:59.60
gunfire encounters we got one of our our part of force guys got shot in the lake and we

1315
02:19:59.60 --> 02:20:07.36
had to bring them to a metavac and some a couple of the Australians got shot and we're processing

1316
02:20:07.36 --> 02:20:16.16
this lab and I tell you the the Australian commandos there's not they're very very effective unit

1317
02:20:16.16 --> 02:20:24.000
and very good you know I kind of put them on part so like maybe our army Rangers and they

1318
02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:31.76
roll in pretty heavy when we roll into they will deploy snipers in their first to set up and if we're

1319
02:20:31.76 --> 02:20:40.16
rolling heavy they'll bring a whole mortar company and everything too so we and that's where you

1320
02:20:40.16 --> 02:20:45.20
started working with them they were being guided by the Aussies yeah we are being guided by the Australian

1321
02:20:45.20 --> 02:20:50.24
also in the commandos okay that's who our partner force was and it's funny because like we be talking

1322
02:20:50.24 --> 02:20:54.80
like this and you can kind of understand the Aussies and they have different slang words and stuff

1323
02:20:54.80 --> 02:21:00.24
but under stress and under firefight you can understand what Taylor saying you're like can you

1324
02:21:00.24 --> 02:21:07.84
ten nine that last please okay and my very best English accent this is what we want you to do

1325
02:21:10.16 --> 02:21:15.92
so you know you know we had quite a few prisoners that they're just up and stuff and

1326
02:21:16.56 --> 02:21:19.36
you know you're getting ready in the middle of the night you're loading them on this helicopter

1327
02:21:19.36 --> 02:21:23.52
and they never seen helicopters up close you know so they're just looking around like

1328
02:21:23.52 --> 02:21:30.96
I think it's like an alien spaceship and come on you come with us who are not going to execute you come on you know so

1329
02:21:31.68 --> 02:21:38.40
we're we're ripped rolling through this tour we're just making some hell of a seizures

1330
02:21:40.56 --> 02:21:46.000
so we're getting close we got like three weeks left to go it's getting close to Halloween

1331
02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:56.32
and this bizarre pig bizarre and the northern helmet province pops up hot you know and these

1332
02:21:56.32 --> 02:22:01.92
bizarre's out there like outdoor flea markets with like rolling garage doors and things and they

1333
02:22:01.92 --> 02:22:09.12
saw everything from you know sundries and shampoo's chickens but also to include chemicals and

1334
02:22:09.12 --> 02:22:15.04
equipment to manufacture heroin I eat the bar making material and small arms so this

1335
02:22:15.04 --> 02:22:21.84
bizarre pops up hot and our team, the fast team that was there before us, Bravo team at hit the

1336
02:22:21.84 --> 02:22:28.48
spazar with the Aussies and they seized a lot of items and they got in a pretty big gunfight

1337
02:22:29.36 --> 02:22:36.80
and in fact the supervisor of the fast team Brett Hamilton who was in my selection he was

1338
02:22:37.84 --> 02:22:43.76
Marine Corrofzer old tough crusty guy and we have the two oldest guys in our selection he's

1339
02:22:43.76 --> 02:22:50.72
a little older than me they're fighting their way back to the helicopters and he ends up getting

1340
02:22:50.72 --> 02:22:58.88
the forest gump wound the beach up in stung him he got shot in the buttocks hard or hard dude man he

1341
02:22:58.88 --> 02:23:04.48
stayed the rest of the turret of they packed his wound he was still going out of since the so

1342
02:23:05.36 --> 02:23:11.68
we knew we were going to run into some resistance but when we could hit it with the Aussies

1343
02:23:11.68 --> 02:23:19.28
there wasn't an air-wain platform available with night vision capabilities that could fly us

1344
02:23:20.32 --> 02:23:25.76
so we're like we really don't want to go during the day we want to use our technical advantages

1345
02:23:26.72 --> 02:23:39.76
but we didn't have that option and we were our confidence was I think a little higher than it should have been

1346
02:23:39.76 --> 02:23:46.24
you know they say you live by the sword you die by the sword so like we're gonna go so

1347
02:23:47.60 --> 02:23:54.48
we're gonna use this air-wain that's training the Afghan pilots for when we left they could take

1348
02:23:54.48 --> 02:24:01.92
over in do stuff and they were using old Russian MI 17 troop transport helicopters now it's a pretty

1349
02:24:01.92 --> 02:24:09.12
robust helicopters not it not as big as our CH 47 but they move pretty fast and they get the door

1350
02:24:09.12 --> 02:24:14.64
and the door gunners they got on one side of pk machine gun on the other side of gal mini gun

1351
02:24:15.52 --> 02:24:23.60
and there's US contract pilots in there with with afghanies and there's one british guy british

1352
02:24:23.60 --> 02:24:32.24
british ab8 or two so the night before they tell us okay um one of the helicopters you guys

1353
02:24:32.24 --> 02:24:40.40
use in this guy gonna be all afghan crew and pilot it we're like oh we don't really want to be on

1354
02:24:40.40 --> 02:24:47.12
that helicopter nor any of our oscis visit they decide that they're gonna get their g hot on that

1355
02:24:47.12 --> 02:24:54.24
day and crash into a mountain don't want to be on that and they're not quite as skilled as our pilots

1356
02:24:54.24 --> 02:25:02.80
so we're like okay we'll go but our afghan pounder for counterforce is gonna infill an

1357
02:25:02.80 --> 02:25:11.60
ex-fill on that bird so we get a plan we're going to hit the bizarre early morning hours

1358
02:25:12.48 --> 02:25:18.000
of october 31st 2011 just after first light and you know we want to get there when no people in the

1359
02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:23.04
bizarre you know so we have to deal monkey around and deal with all that crap just get there

1360
02:25:23.04 --> 02:25:30.64
we're gonna hit the spazard we're gonna hit another location after it so the plan was we arrived in

1361
02:25:31.44 --> 02:25:39.20
three m i seven no four m i seventeen's some fast fast team members and australians are going to be in one

1362
02:25:40.24 --> 02:25:46.80
the afghan pounder force is gonna be in another and then the australians are going to be in the other two birds

1363
02:25:46.80 --> 02:25:55.12
and the australians are gonna land and kind of set up an outer perimeter to try to keep the

1364
02:25:55.12 --> 02:26:00.40
enemy from maneuvering in on us but the only bad thing is it was a little bit of mountain this

1365
02:26:00.40 --> 02:26:08.40
area so the enemy had the high ground on us and our afghan pounder force are gonna land in the

1366
02:26:08.40 --> 02:26:14.48
helicopter they're gonna search this little village area right outside the bizarre we're gonna link up

1367
02:26:14.48 --> 02:26:22.72
and then we're going to search the bizarre in two groups i was in charge of one of the elements made up of

1368
02:26:22.72 --> 02:26:30.32
fast team members with some our afghan partner force and then one of our other guys was leading the other

1369
02:26:30.32 --> 02:26:37.76
group so we land um start moving through hook up with the afghans and shortly after infill

1370
02:26:37.76 --> 02:26:47.68
we receive start receiving sporadic incoming fire not very effective so we're moving through and

1371
02:26:47.68 --> 02:26:54.48
we're finding poppy seed and stuff to manufacture heroin and i'm standing outside of one of the

1372
02:26:54.48 --> 02:27:03.60
stalls and the bizarre behind this old gb dot car i hear a shot fired and i hear it hit the

1373
02:27:03.60 --> 02:27:11.68
beat up car behind me and then i feel the back of my neck burn i'm like oh shit so i dive into the

1374
02:27:11.68 --> 02:27:16.24
stall of the bizarre i put my hand on my back of my neck to see if any blood i don't see any blood

1375
02:27:16.24 --> 02:27:23.12
on my glove i have whenever afghan translators look at it and he says oh it looks okay so

1376
02:27:23.76 --> 02:27:27.44
but the bullet got so close i could feel the heat of the bullet burning the back of my neck

1377
02:27:27.44 --> 02:27:34.40
so i kind of had my guard up after that and i'm like oh that's a close call joe so i kind of was

1378
02:27:34.40 --> 02:27:40.000
using all my techniques and tactics i had learned throughout the years on the police department on

1379
02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:48.64
the swat team as a DA agent as the DA fast training and prior missions so shortly after that

1380
02:27:48.64 --> 02:27:54.80
over the little shitty loudspeaker system they have over there the insurgency to a call the arms

1381
02:27:54.80 --> 02:28:01.84
today's your day to die we must kill the infidels we must drive them out of our land

1382
02:28:02.80 --> 02:28:10.56
so incoming gunfire really increases so we really hear the Aussies get into it with them

1383
02:28:10.56 --> 02:28:14.96
and you're still in the bizarre at this point we're still in a bizarre and the Aussies are on external

1384
02:28:14.96 --> 02:28:21.20
security yes and we have the marine air wing providing close air support and we hear the the

1385
02:28:21.20 --> 02:28:27.44
marine air wing get into it the Aussies get into it so we're finishing up what we have to do

1386
02:28:28.32 --> 02:28:36.08
we're taking the samples taking photographs and starting to destroy all the stuff so we do that

1387
02:28:36.08 --> 02:28:43.20
and we say okay we're like 10 mic ten minutes out and we'll be ready to move so we start calling

1388
02:28:43.20 --> 02:28:50.72
our birds to come get us so they're inbound and we have to make our way to our x-fill locations

1389
02:28:50.72 --> 02:28:55.84
we're only about a couple a couple hundred meters away not far but we get bogged down in the gunfire

1390
02:28:57.20 --> 02:29:03.76
so we can't make our x-fill positions in time so we have to wave the helicopter's off

1391
02:29:04.32 --> 02:29:10.88
so they go a distance away but keep the rotor spinning so you know at this time you know

1392
02:29:10.88 --> 02:29:17.04
like moving in between mud huts and you know you're leapfrogging and you're like

1393
02:29:17.04 --> 02:29:23.36
how you know I know we have to get the helicopter here because the longer we stay the more the enemy

1394
02:29:23.36 --> 02:29:32.80
has time to amass you know and it's not going to be good but you know in combat you can't show

1395
02:29:32.80 --> 02:29:38.000
fear to other people on your team or squad even though you're feeling like I don't know

1396
02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:43.12
for going to get the helicopter you know so you're moving and we finally get set up in our

1397
02:29:43.12 --> 02:29:49.20
x-fill positions afghans and they're a little spot and us in the Aussie so the four helicopters

1398
02:29:49.20 --> 02:29:55.36
come in and we're receiving pretty heavy incoming fire two to include belt fed machine gun fire

1399
02:29:57.76 --> 02:30:04.72
don't we don't we call any RPGs so the four helicopters come in and we got the afghan crew

1400
02:30:04.72 --> 02:30:11.52
and pilot helicopter that one we're never going to get on in a million years and three land

1401
02:30:11.52 --> 02:30:18.24
guess which one doesn't land the afghan crew and pilot helicopter and after worries they said

1402
02:30:18.24 --> 02:30:23.52
because of the brownout conditions with the other copters helicopters picking up all the dust and

1403
02:30:23.52 --> 02:30:31.04
rotor wash and all the incoming fire they didn't feel comfortable landing so instead of waiting

1404
02:30:31.04 --> 02:30:37.12
for their bird to come guess what the afghans do pile on to the next helicopter and it's ours

1405
02:30:37.12 --> 02:30:44.96
so they get their first we're in this open field we run out there we're like get the hell off

1406
02:30:44.96 --> 02:30:49.76
they're not moving I don't blame them I want to go back into that hell so instead of being

1407
02:30:49.76 --> 02:30:56.40
shot in this open damn field we're like okay just go so the three helicopters lift off

1408
02:30:56.96 --> 02:31:02.48
and then it's us fast team members and several Aussies so we're coming to guys are left on the ground

1409
02:31:02.48 --> 02:31:16.000
um my 10 15 of you yeah at max we had from fast we had we had Jared just in two mats

1410
02:31:19.20 --> 02:31:21.84
brence

1411
02:31:21.60 --> 02:31:22.000
Paul

1412
02:31:24.08 --> 02:31:32.24
myself and a couple Aussies you're like under 10 so of course all the fires focused on us it

1413
02:31:32.24 --> 02:31:38.32
disappoint so we take cover in a little ditch and then our helicopter short time lands about

1414
02:31:38.32 --> 02:31:42.64
100 meters away and this the one we're never gonna get on the crew and pilot helicopter

1415
02:31:43.28 --> 02:31:48.16
so they land and I remember saying to myself of course you're heart racing

1416
02:31:48.96 --> 02:31:54.000
feel like I get to get a lot of here I remember saying to myself this is gonna be a shitty run

1417
02:31:55.28 --> 02:31:59.12
you know there's bullets is popping up everywhere so I but I knew we couldn't stay

1418
02:31:59.12 --> 02:32:07.20
hey so one of the last memories I kind of have from that day is I get up to run

1419
02:32:09.20 --> 02:32:13.52
I remember firing a couple shots on the run towards the direction I felt in surgeons were fire

1420
02:32:13.52 --> 02:32:20.64
in at us from I guess I got the helicopter about mid pack and that's when I paused and was providing

1421
02:32:20.64 --> 02:32:27.12
fire for the rest of my teammates to get honored near the helicopter and then once that happened my

1422
02:32:27.12 --> 02:32:34.88
team leader Jarajanson said let's roll I guess and that's when I turned left to run out to the

1423
02:32:34.88 --> 02:32:41.68
helicopter and then I got hit in the head at first he thought I fell and he's trying to

1424
02:32:41.68 --> 02:32:48.32
rouse me and I'm not moving I'm face first in the ground and then he rolls me over and he sees

1425
02:32:48.32 --> 02:32:53.36
the like ballistic class as I was wearing were shattered and he sees a hole in my head

1426
02:32:53.36 --> 02:33:01.68
so they roll me over and they're thinking I'm dead which is very you know

1427
02:33:02.80 --> 02:33:10.08
very possible situation here you can take around to the head and so they grabbed me scooped me up

1428
02:33:10.08 --> 02:33:14.72
throw me in helicopter that's when breads and you know he's put when covered fire down

1429
02:33:15.76 --> 02:33:19.52
Matt Stewart's trying to get the Afghan doorgunners to fire they're not even firing

1430
02:33:19.52 --> 02:33:26.08
and helicopters getting shot up you know we're getting shot and he's like shoot shoot shoot say

1431
02:33:26.08 --> 02:33:30.72
fire a couple rounds you know burst into the ground so he's like no shoot shoot he takes you know he

1432
02:33:30.72 --> 02:33:39.12
grabs the gun and starts shooting a little bit so they throw me on the helicopter and you know they

1433
02:33:39.12 --> 02:33:42.88
think I'm dead you know the helicopter is very loud and they're of course and everything so you can't

1434
02:33:42.88 --> 02:33:52.16
hear breathing so one of my teammates Justin Vanderbilt who actually before DEA he was a medic

1435
02:33:52.16 --> 02:33:58.80
in New Orleans and he was there during Katrina so he was kind of like one of our more highly

1436
02:33:58.80 --> 02:34:04.64
trained kind of our version of like 18 Delta medical guy even though we all go through pretty intense

1437
02:34:04.64 --> 02:34:13.28
tea triple sea combat care and actually live tissue training and stuff he's like he's alive he's

1438
02:34:13.28 --> 02:34:24.56
breathing so they start getting my stuff cut out and they apply combat gauze to my head wounds

1439
02:34:25.44 --> 02:34:30.000
which is gauze with clotting agent in there so they're getting that under control

1440
02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:34.96
and then a lot of times with facial wounds or different that have wounds you want to try to

1441
02:34:34.96 --> 02:34:40.64
establish a better airway and you know and you can do that by a couple different ways you can

1442
02:34:40.64 --> 02:34:45.84
do a cry chorea cut you know under the person's throat and you insert an implementer helping

1443
02:34:45.84 --> 02:34:52.56
breathe more or you can use a nasal fair and gill airway and they decide they're going to

1444
02:34:52.56 --> 02:34:58.56
stick a nasal fair and gill airway up my nose and in training we have to insert these in

1445
02:34:58.56 --> 02:35:06.32
any other and just sort of a nose this is like a it's basically like a you shaped tube that you

1446
02:35:06.32 --> 02:35:12.88
cram and someone's nose that will open up the airway between your nostrils and like your

1447
02:35:12.88 --> 02:35:16.24
lungs not all the way down your lungs but like through your head you know they're probably

1448
02:35:16.24 --> 02:35:20.96
what do you think they are Joe like maybe five inches long total something like that and one end

1449
02:35:20.96 --> 02:35:26.80
looks like there's a funnel on there and the other and you know in training we can put light

1450
02:35:26.80 --> 02:35:35.52
a cane in our nose before we do it but it still sucks or no offense attended we're training

1451
02:35:35.52 --> 02:35:42.000
with the seals they allow us to spit out a mistake he's up and he's not fun and when they're

1452
02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:48.24
cramming this up my nose I come to I don't remember any of this it's probably a good thing

1453
02:35:48.24 --> 02:36:00.56
um I'm talking making sense I recognize people's voices I'm not complaining about my head even

1454
02:36:00.56 --> 02:36:08.80
I have a hole on each set I decide I say get it out of my eyes the pressure from the high

1455
02:36:08.80 --> 02:36:15.04
velocity round which we think was the armoured person around from Belvedpe K machine gun

1456
02:36:15.04 --> 02:36:19.68
traveling through my head ruptured both my eye globes into touch both redness

1457
02:36:20.64 --> 02:36:24.80
so they poor saline solutions on my eyes of course that doesn't do jack crap

1458
02:36:25.52 --> 02:36:28.48
and then I'm telling them I gotta move my leg

1459
02:36:30.08 --> 02:36:34.32
so they think I'm shot in the leg too with all the gunfire that was coming at us

1460
02:36:35.04 --> 02:36:39.92
and this particular mission I did not have my Belvedpe machine gun I had my

1461
02:36:39.92 --> 02:36:45.92
carbine with a suppressor on it and I had been shooting quite a bit so when I got knocked on

1462
02:36:45.92 --> 02:36:52.88
conscious I fell on the barrel of my rifle and it burned inside of my left leg real bad

1463
02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:57.60
and actually the cry pants I was wearing it were burned you know they were burned

1464
02:36:58.80 --> 02:37:06.40
and they you know they burned my leg pretty good so they're you know they're working on me and you

1465
02:37:06.40 --> 02:37:11.12
know they're getting me back to the base as quick as possible and on my team

1466
02:37:11.12 --> 02:37:15.36
made said the thing that scared them even when the bleeding stopped my head just kept

1467
02:37:15.36 --> 02:37:20.40
swallowing up and swallowing up they knew there's nothing they could do there but luckily for me

1468
02:37:23.92 --> 02:37:31.20
the helicopter's there when I got shot so you know I usually take the time now to

1469
02:37:31.20 --> 02:37:40.08
talk about some of the things that I think led to my survivability is that you know even though

1470
02:37:40.08 --> 02:37:47.52
I was severely wounded by my team providing that fast medical attention they had stalled my

1471
02:37:47.52 --> 02:37:57.76
decompensation giving time for me to get the higher care and I know it's not invoked at times

1472
02:37:57.76 --> 02:38:05.20
or this and that but for all instances I should be dead talking to the medical professionals over

1473
02:38:05.20 --> 02:38:13.36
80% of the people who get my injury do not survive and the day I became a police officer my

1474
02:38:14.32 --> 02:38:18.48
mother gave me a saint Michael's medallion it's a patron saint the protect police officers

1475
02:38:18.96 --> 02:38:26.96
and always carrying one on me I had one in my kit I always did the Psalm 91 prayer before I went on

1476
02:38:26.96 --> 02:38:32.48
missions and carried a copy on me that's the prayer of soldiers going into battle for the Lord to

1477
02:38:32.48 --> 02:38:41.52
protect you and I had one of my grandfather's dog takes a war war two on me and he was not my time to go

1478
02:38:43.12 --> 02:38:49.20
the Lord had more for me to do I think some of that is me doing my motivational speaking now

1479
02:38:49.20 --> 02:38:59.44
helping others deal with situations and instances and it just was not my time to go and then with all

1480
02:38:59.44 --> 02:39:06.40
our high speed medical training that we had once my teammates found that I was alive nobody panicked

1481
02:39:07.20 --> 02:39:11.20
unfortunately over there we had to use our medical training more than when we had a light

1482
02:39:11.20 --> 02:39:21.84
so that and also you know I talk about mindset you know you have to have this mindset

1483
02:39:22.88 --> 02:39:29.44
that if you're in a fight for your life or you're with a suspect or an enemy you're fighting for

1484
02:39:29.44 --> 02:39:36.40
your life or getting in a shootout or it could be you could be at home you could have an accident or

1485
02:39:36.40 --> 02:39:41.92
drive a car if you're in a fight you have to survive you have to fight you have to hit

1486
02:39:42.64 --> 02:39:49.68
claw scratch god whatever you have to do you have to think yourself I am not going to lose this fight

1487
02:39:49.68 --> 02:39:56.16
I am not going to lose I'm going to survive I'm going to make it through that you have to have that

1488
02:39:56.16 --> 02:40:04.32
mental attitude you know I kind of call it the warriors mindset or the winning mentality

1489
02:40:04.32 --> 02:40:10.08
that I'm going to survive and make it through this you know there's no way I'm not going to

1490
02:40:10.08 --> 02:40:20.40
make it through even though at first I was not unconscious my body my mind didn't give up

1491
02:40:21.60 --> 02:40:25.60
you're going to you're going to make it through this show you know I didn't see any bright light or

1492
02:40:25.60 --> 02:40:31.36
anything I may have saw a little fire below or something it wasn't it wasn't time

1493
02:40:31.36 --> 02:40:41.44
so also talking to the doctors I was in really great physical shape when I got shot

1494
02:40:42.40 --> 02:40:48.96
and the better shape you're in a lot of times the more traumatic injury you can survive

1495
02:40:49.92 --> 02:40:55.44
and a lot of times the better your recovery is you know so when I talk to groups you know

1496
02:40:55.44 --> 02:40:59.68
especially military law enforcement groups you know I tell people you don't have to be Olympic

1497
02:40:59.68 --> 02:41:05.52
athlete but please please please be in the best shape you can because it may save your life you

1498
02:41:05.52 --> 02:41:09.76
never know like I said it could be a car accident in your end or you could fall over ladder at the

1499
02:41:09.76 --> 02:41:19.04
house you know just please stay in the best shape that you can so we fly back to the base

1500
02:41:19.04 --> 02:41:25.60
tearing count which we're staying at with the Aussies so we land at and they're field there and

1501
02:41:25.60 --> 02:41:31.44
the ambulance comes out to meet us and they don't bring a stretcher to the bird they think

1502
02:41:31.44 --> 02:41:37.52
they had me on the stretcher even though we have them they didn't have me on one so I

1503
02:41:37.52 --> 02:41:44.24
hear this commotion going on so guess what the guy shot in the head does he gets off the walk off the

1504
02:41:44.24 --> 02:41:52.80
helicopter my team I said no Joe we got you who will carry you so they carry me to the ambulance

1505
02:41:52.80 --> 02:41:58.96
bring me to the medical facility there they do what they can for me there do you remember trying

1506
02:41:58.96 --> 02:42:04.24
to get up and walk no I don't I don't remember talking to my teammates and the helicopter none of

1507
02:42:04.24 --> 02:42:10.24
that all of our remembers firing a couple shots on the run because you know talking to the doctors

1508
02:42:10.24 --> 02:42:15.52
because I guess you know when I got hit it was just lights out and it's kind of your brains

1509
02:42:15.52 --> 02:42:22.80
mechanism for texture and I'm probably glad I don't remember any of that stuff so they brought me

1510
02:42:22.80 --> 02:42:29.12
the medical facility there they knocked me unconscious did what they can for me there and then

1511
02:42:29.12 --> 02:42:36.000
they make arrangements to fly me in a metavac helicopter to can to our airfield which they had

1512
02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:43.20
a near-search and an eye surgeon standing by so I'm flown over there with one of my teammates

1513
02:42:43.20 --> 02:42:51.76
Matt Stewart we arrived there so they of course they do an assessment on me there and it was

1514
02:42:51.76 --> 02:42:57.76
fortunate for me that day it was Halloween so not a lot of groups were doing or units were doing

1515
02:42:57.76 --> 02:43:05.36
missions so they didn't have many casualties in the hospital there so they first taken look at me

1516
02:43:05.36 --> 02:43:14.32
and I guess I'm starting to be kept alive with basic life-saving procedures at this time and

1517
02:43:14.32 --> 02:43:19.12
they don't think there's anything they can do to save me so they're just going to have me

1518
02:43:19.92 --> 02:43:27.92
pass peacefully and then have me set home back home on an angel flight deceased but the doctor

1519
02:43:27.92 --> 02:43:32.64
then they're certain he's pretty aggressive guy and then the the nurse it in took me there

1520
02:43:32.64 --> 02:43:39.28
and he's looking at me he's talking to my teammates you know my teammate that I was talking

1521
02:43:39.28 --> 02:43:44.88
after and now I got up to walk off I was trying to get whatever's in my eyes out and he sees what's

1522
02:43:44.88 --> 02:43:54.24
shape I'm in he's convinced that if he gets in and performs surgery that they can get the

1523
02:43:55.20 --> 02:44:00.48
bleeding in my head stopped and some of the pressure relieved in least get me home to the

1524
02:44:00.48 --> 02:44:05.52
state so my family can see me didn't know what condition I was going to be and even though

1525
02:44:05.52 --> 02:44:15.28
I you know I was talking in the helicopter and he had to decide whether I could survive even

1526
02:44:15.28 --> 02:44:24.56
what he was going to do to me during surgery and he felt strongly that I had the wheel that I

1527
02:44:24.56 --> 02:44:32.000
wasn't going to die and he told me after the fact with brain injuries and head injuries he said

1528
02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:36.16
there was a smell that somebody gave off that he could tell if they weren't going to make it

1529
02:44:36.16 --> 02:44:43.84
turn out and he said I did not have that smell and they had nurse there you know they're

1530
02:44:43.84 --> 02:44:47.44
bickering back and forth whether you know he's fighting in the command whether they should use

1531
02:44:47.44 --> 02:44:54.08
their resources to save me and I guess there's a line in the hospital there once you cross

1532
02:44:54.08 --> 02:45:02.64
over that line surgery has to take the patient you can't push him back so the head nurse at the

1533
02:45:02.64 --> 02:45:06.72
time which I'm still friends with I'm not going to mention her name because I don't want to

1534
02:45:06.72 --> 02:45:16.88
get in any trouble push me over that line so surgery had to take me so they began to operate on

1535
02:45:16.88 --> 02:45:22.72
me the neurosurgeon spend approximately four and a half hours operating on me they actually

1536
02:45:22.72 --> 02:45:31.60
moved the whole frontal skull piece off my head my frontal all my frontal forehead is now titanium

1537
02:45:32.88 --> 02:45:38.64
they got the bleeding stopped they got they put a valve in there to regulate my pressure

1538
02:45:39.36 --> 02:45:45.44
and then the eye surgeon came in and he's like she's like talking to the main doctors like he's

1539
02:45:45.44 --> 02:45:51.04
really survivable am I going to spend all this work on somebody where he's just going to be sent home

1540
02:45:51.04 --> 02:45:58.56
in a box and that was a possibility but he says I think you know he's gonna make it show she

1541
02:45:58.56 --> 02:46:07.92
spent approximately eight hours piecing my eyes back together with a microscope and there's work she

1542
02:46:07.92 --> 02:46:16.72
did has given me the opportunity in the future to be able to potentially see more my left eye

1543
02:46:16.72 --> 02:46:21.28
has some light perception and I can see some moving in my left eye and I can see them shapes so

1544
02:46:21.28 --> 02:46:28.24
there's a bigger color contrast between light and dark so she piece of my eyes back together so

1545
02:46:29.04 --> 02:46:34.08
the next day one of my best friends and my unit he wasn't on another part of the country trying to

1546
02:46:34.08 --> 02:46:40.48
get some other ops together he makes it there and he flies back and roots the states with me

1547
02:46:40.48 --> 02:46:48.40
of course they have me on this big I guess medical plane you know pretty much each patient has their own

1548
02:46:48.40 --> 02:46:53.68
nurse and everything and we're in route back to the states and of course they're then in my family

1549
02:46:53.68 --> 02:47:02.000
know what happened and everything and at the time I was engaged and I told my fans at the time I said

1550
02:47:02.80 --> 02:47:08.64
don't if I can't get a hold of you you can't get a hold of me I'm out of an op when I get back in

1551
02:47:08.64 --> 02:47:16.56
will Skype or in all text you are call you I said only worry if two people come knocking on the door

1552
02:47:18.24 --> 02:47:23.44
so she was a nurse she worked night shift and she Afghanistan was like eight hours hours different

1553
02:47:24.40 --> 02:47:30.24
and she here's a knock on the door that morning she had back from work and she goes to the

1554
02:47:30.24 --> 02:47:34.08
door and she sees two gentlemen through the window she doesn't recommend and they put their badges

1555
02:47:34.08 --> 02:47:41.44
out and she's like oh shit so she opens the door and she starts balling they're like he's not dead

1556
02:47:42.24 --> 02:47:49.04
he's insurgery we don't know but he's alive at this point so they get all my family notified and

1557
02:47:49.04 --> 02:47:55.20
everything and then we had to fly over to law and stole Germany and they have pretty good medical

1558
02:47:55.20 --> 02:48:00.80
thing there with my buddy Travis and it was the pressure my head was rising they kept me there for

1559
02:48:00.80 --> 02:48:11.84
three nights and then they flew me to Andrew's Air Force Base I was gonna say dover but you don't

1560
02:48:11.84 --> 02:48:18.16
want to make it a dover is that means you're dead so they flew me to Andrew's and then had all my

1561
02:48:18.16 --> 02:48:23.12
family at the hospital and all the people from D.A. and everything that the higher ups and you know

1562
02:48:23.12 --> 02:48:29.84
some of the other people on that team's waiting to receive me so they take me be ambulance over to

1563
02:48:29.84 --> 02:48:39.20
Walter Reed National Naval Medical Hospital and Bethesda Maryland so they when I arrived they let my family

1564
02:48:39.20 --> 02:48:45.52
see me they plan on doing some other surgeries there but of course I'm a mess I have no frontal

1565
02:48:45.52 --> 02:48:51.20
skull piece my head's okay didn I guess you know I'm swollen I got a tube coming out and

1566
02:48:51.92 --> 02:48:58.08
almost every part of my body and they let my family see me and at the time

1567
02:48:58.08 --> 02:49:09.68
my fiance was a intensive care nurse she's seen a lot of trauma a lot of bad things but I

1568
02:49:09.68 --> 02:49:14.80
guess when she saw me of course when it's your loved ones it's different she put her hand on

1569
02:49:14.80 --> 02:49:20.96
them out screamed ran out of the room and passed out her dad had to help her off the floor you know

1570
02:49:20.96 --> 02:49:26.72
it's when it's somebody you love and care about it's different so they brought me in there they

1571
02:49:26.72 --> 02:49:32.88
did some surgeries on me they reattached my retinas they cleaned up my head area more

1572
02:49:34.16 --> 02:49:40.96
and preparation for putting my plate on my metal plate that I have now on later

1573
02:49:40.96 --> 02:49:45.52
they don't want to put it on too quick was a chance of rejection is greater and everything so

1574
02:49:45.52 --> 02:49:54.64
they want to wait so they do that and then they put me in an induced coma

1575
02:49:54.64 --> 02:50:01.76
with that that profile you know want to maybe call it the Michael Jackson drug the one

1576
02:50:01.76 --> 02:50:06.72
Michael Jackson used to sleep got on rest Michael Jackson you know got rest of soul it works

1577
02:50:06.72 --> 02:50:11.76
very good for putting people in a coma because you can reverse them real quick but not necessarily

1578
02:50:11.76 --> 02:50:18.08
it's not not necessarily prescribed for sleep so they had me on that and they had me

1579
02:50:18.08 --> 02:50:23.44
intubated and everything so they had me an induced coma for about a week and then when they

1580
02:50:23.44 --> 02:50:29.92
were getting ready to bring me out of the coma they didn't know how I was going to be even though

1581
02:50:29.92 --> 02:50:35.20
I was talking and making sense on the helicopter and all that with the additional trauma of the

1582
02:50:35.20 --> 02:50:40.88
surgeries they wouldn't know if I could speak at all but I remember anything what I have my same personality

1583
02:50:42.24 --> 02:50:47.12
but they certainly surely after they learned I was the same smart ass Joe I was before

1584
02:50:47.12 --> 02:50:53.60
you know I was looking for you as the first they asked me you know where do you live

1585
02:50:54.64 --> 02:50:59.28
I'm like oh Detroit Michigan what do you do? I'm a police officer what's your dog's name

1586
02:50:59.28 --> 02:51:05.60
I said Max I was my very first dog I had when I was a kid but I soon surely after I got my bearings

1587
02:51:05.60 --> 02:51:14.56
I knew who I was at the particular time I knew was working for and everything so then started my road to

1588
02:51:14.56 --> 02:51:24.000
recovery you know so now I'm blind I'm not an abesh you know best condition physically at this

1589
02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:32.000
particular time because of the injuries you know so they began to start my recovery process

1590
02:51:33.84 --> 02:51:39.68
and I was on a feeding tube for a while so they had to pull that out and they trick you

1591
02:51:39.68 --> 02:51:47.44
they say okay we're gonna pull us out on three one two like oh you didn't wait for three I was like

1592
02:51:49.28 --> 02:51:53.60
I'm like we say that because we want to catch you by surprise you don't want you to say three

1593
02:51:53.60 --> 02:51:59.20
then pull and then you tighten it and it makes it worse so I had to learn how to eat solid food

1594
02:51:59.20 --> 02:52:05.04
and I failed a couple swallows studies at first and you know of course I'm losing weights by the

1595
02:52:05.04 --> 02:52:10.80
minute because I'm not being active and the people at the hospital those he's got a lot of muscle he's in good shape

1596
02:52:10.80 --> 02:52:15.44
you know he's and Mike's wife said to time where I experience a you didn't see him before

1597
02:52:16.32 --> 02:52:21.20
so we started making them feed me you know like insure in between meals and stuff to try to put some

1598
02:52:21.20 --> 02:52:27.52
more weight on and we do things like okay today your task is okay Joe have you put your shorts on

1599
02:52:27.52 --> 02:52:32.72
and your t-shirt and your socks you know how long is it going to take you nice it you know obviously five

1600
02:52:32.72 --> 02:52:36.96
or ten minutes or whatever so the one time I'm sitting there with the physical therapist and my

1601
02:52:38.32 --> 02:52:47.12
X and I'm feeling these shorts and I'm like these don't feel like my size I'm like what size are these

1602
02:52:48.24 --> 02:52:52.96
and of course my X doesn't say anything like a church mouse she's like she knows she's

1603
02:52:52.96 --> 02:53:01.04
tumble with size they are I'm gonna throw a hissy fit so the therapist says let me see I'll tell you

1604
02:53:01.04 --> 02:53:06.16
she goes there medium I took those shorts I threw them across your my son I'm a big fellow I

1605
02:53:06.16 --> 02:53:10.88
were extra large if I would have put those extra large shorts and everybody would fell straight to the floor

1606
02:53:11.44 --> 02:53:18.000
because when I got shot I was probably 230's really lean and they would weigh me on the bed every day

1607
02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:25.36
I was down I got down to like 160 something so those shorts would what was the time frame for that

1608
02:53:25.36 --> 02:53:39.76
like a month two months I spent two months there not she's not not long so we got over that and then I was I was confused and then

1609
02:53:40.80 --> 02:53:45.20
of course my I doctor he was his name was Dr. Chung there and it's very serious man

1610
02:53:45.68 --> 02:53:51.84
someone day we're sitting in my room my father's there with me and my team made Travis and Dr. Chung

1611
02:53:51.84 --> 02:53:58.80
walks in and Travis is like Dr. Chung I want to tell you Joe thinks he's African American

1612
02:54:00.32 --> 02:54:05.92
I was all jacked up so I'm talking in acting like an inner city African American guy and

1613
02:54:06.80 --> 02:54:15.04
then going everything Dr. Chung like are you serious and Travis is yes and then my dad's like well he is from Detroit

1614
02:54:15.04 --> 02:54:22.96
so Dr. Chung about it's pretty serious but I don't he acted that way for a couple of days you know

1615
02:54:23.36 --> 02:54:30.48
and then I got my bearings back so yeah it you know it progressed there and they did everything

1616
02:54:30.48 --> 02:54:37.92
they can for me there and then they let me start doing like a little bit of work out stuff there and they brought

1617
02:54:37.92 --> 02:54:43.04
me to like the little PT Jim area and they're like okay we're gonna have you do like some

1618
02:54:43.04 --> 02:54:49.28
little dumbbell stuff and like okay tell me which way or the one 20s yeah with the way you know

1619
02:54:49.28 --> 02:54:54.40
tell me it's good I said these are too heavy no these are too heavy these are too heavy okay these are good

1620
02:54:55.12 --> 02:54:59.04
and then I found out after the fact actually Joe those were the pink dumbbells you were using

1621
02:54:59.04 --> 02:55:07.68
oh no really by two pounds oh okay I'm getting it work you know yeah yeah you know so

1622
02:55:07.68 --> 02:55:15.20
it did that and they start you know teaching you how to operate blind and I don't know for some

1623
02:55:15.20 --> 02:55:21.44
goofy reason I thought I didn't have any skin on my head where my brain was I thought it was just like

1624
02:55:21.44 --> 02:55:28.80
mesh so they're like Joe you need to take a shower we need to get your shower I'm like I can't get my

1625
02:55:28.80 --> 02:55:35.84
brain wet and Max was like Joe you have skin there I'm like oh I do so you kind of lose all your

1626
02:55:35.84 --> 02:55:39.52
dignity you gotta go in the shower with this you know this nurse or whatever they're all

1627
02:55:39.52 --> 02:55:44.56
gowned up and all this rubber gear and you just you know standard with your birthday suit on

1628
02:55:44.56 --> 02:55:51.52
but naked I'm like guess I'm taking the shower you know it's so how long was this you know recovery

1629
02:55:51.52 --> 02:55:56.64
process how long did you stay with it was this still taking place at Bethesda yes that was there for

1630
02:55:56.64 --> 02:56:04.80
two months two months when so you lost freaking whatever you went from 230 to 160 something yes

1631
02:56:04.80 --> 02:56:11.84
and now you start rebuilding yes and and when you start rebuilding is that really starts take place

1632
02:56:11.84 --> 02:56:21.28
when you get out of Bethesda yes was they transferred me down to the McGuire V.A. down in

1633
02:56:21.28 --> 02:56:27.76
Richmond Virginia you know after that so it was kind of nice but we're getting close to Christmas

1634
02:56:27.76 --> 02:56:36.40
time now ish and so on the weekends they let me go home as long as I came back Sunday night

1635
02:56:37.28 --> 02:56:42.72
and I got to go home for the holidays and then we became started doing a lot learning there a lot

1636
02:56:42.72 --> 02:56:50.24
more how to operate in a blind world like use the blind cane use some of the voice over stuff like

1637
02:56:50.24 --> 02:56:59.60
on the computer and things like that and I began to let me start working out more there you know

1638
02:56:59.60 --> 02:57:05.92
so during this time I'm like I don't know what's going to happen to me or not happen to me and

1639
02:57:06.72 --> 02:57:12.000
how like our administrator at the time her name was Michelle Lynn a hard she was like in charge of us

1640
02:57:13.04 --> 02:57:19.36
yes my buddy Travis what is Joa he's like Joa wants to keep working she goes will make it happen

1641
02:57:19.36 --> 02:57:25.60
so even the I didn't meet the physical requirements to be a DA agent anymore they kept me honest

1642
02:57:25.60 --> 02:57:31.52
a DA agent after this because they figured out the money you make a lot more retiring as a regular

1643
02:57:31.52 --> 02:57:39.84
agent rather than taking a medical disability so they kind of hooked me up and during my stay in

1644
02:57:39.84 --> 02:57:51.04
Walter Reed Bethesda hearing my teammates and my parents talk about they're supposed to bring

1645
02:57:51.04 --> 02:57:56.80
all these wounded service members back home overseas tore up bad the line is a younger kids

1646
02:57:57.68 --> 02:58:02.72
when this happened to me I was like 41 years old I lived a pretty damn good life

1647
02:58:02.72 --> 02:58:10.32
and a lot of these kids maybe not married maybe newly married maybe just had some

1648
02:58:11.52 --> 02:58:17.68
you know a child and you know their life is drastically changed forever so when I would have my

1649
02:58:17.68 --> 02:58:27.20
pity party and why me woe was me you know I would say Jo it always could be worse somebody always

1650
02:58:27.20 --> 02:58:36.40
has it worse than you you know you can't control what you don't have anymore all you can do

1651
02:58:36.40 --> 02:58:46.16
it's working work with what you have now so in life when bad things happen we can make a couple

1652
02:58:46.16 --> 02:58:54.80
choices we can let life pass us by or we can get out there and do as much as we can do and I made

1653
02:58:54.80 --> 02:59:01.60
a commitment to myself that I'm going to try to do as much blind as when I could see I didn't know

1654
02:59:01.60 --> 02:59:10.24
how that was going to look but I made that commitment and when there's a will there's a way

1655
02:59:11.68 --> 02:59:16.96
if you want to figure out how to do stuff and make stuff happen it may not be the same way you

1656
02:59:16.96 --> 02:59:25.44
used to do it it may take you a lot longer but if you really want to do something bad enough you can do

1657
02:59:25.44 --> 02:59:33.60
it so I made that commitment right there right then and I tell people when I talk it's not been

1658
02:59:33.60 --> 02:59:39.44
easy every day's a struggle for me I still wake up every day blind you know I've had a very

1659
02:59:39.44 --> 02:59:48.24
serious severe traumatic brain injury I've had I've pretty bad PTSD because of it and I've done

1660
02:59:48.24 --> 02:59:55.20
stuff to manage and mitigate that and you know when I talk you know with the amount of suicide

1661
02:59:55.20 --> 03:00:00.24
from service members in this and that you know a lot of us want to play work tough and it doesn't

1662
03:00:00.24 --> 03:00:07.28
affect us and this and that but you can't get help unless you admit you have it and ask for the help

1663
03:00:07.28 --> 03:00:12.72
as there are things and things out there and I got the Stelik gangly and block shot which helps

1664
03:00:12.72 --> 03:00:18.48
for PTSD you have a Stelik land in your neck when you have PTSD that land gets all screwed up

1665
03:00:19.20 --> 03:00:22.88
and they go in and dead in the gland and it's kind of like reboots your brain and your computer

1666
03:00:23.84 --> 03:00:31.04
and it helps you tremendously you know so there's things things out there so there's things that

1667
03:00:31.04 --> 03:00:41.36
I've went on and done since I've been blind I've turned them skydive jumped and a buddy of mine

1668
03:00:41.36 --> 03:00:48.000
his wife on Monterey California runs a skydiving place and before I wanted to turn them jump but

1669
03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:54.72
I'm always kind of been over the weight limit and he says for a tandem he's like what you know

1670
03:00:54.72 --> 03:01:01.28
what are you gonna weigh Jocelyn about 240 right now and I knew I couldn't be over two he says come up

1671
03:01:01.92 --> 03:01:06.88
it will make it happen so he's when we weighed in his wife on the places tell me way 230

1672
03:01:08.08 --> 03:01:13.20
so my tandem guy this jump with me takes look at me so we're gonna fall real quick you're like

1673
03:01:13.20 --> 03:01:19.36
how far do you want to how hard do you want to jump Joe? Is it high as we can go? So I guess we

1674
03:01:19.36 --> 03:01:25.52
jumped at 16,000 feet wow and I guess that's the highest you can go without we should go without

1675
03:01:25.52 --> 03:01:31.52
ox you know you know any higher neck you want to be on oxygen and any higher in that you need to get

1676
03:01:31.52 --> 03:01:37.04
FAA approval so we were the first ones that go out of the bird and I don't know if it's worse being able

1677
03:01:37.04 --> 03:01:45.68
to see or not you know we jumped out of a king air you know the open that door and that wind's

1678
03:01:45.68 --> 03:01:50.56
just rushing you know where the first they tell you what to do you know and we're gonna rock back

1679
03:01:50.56 --> 03:01:56.16
on you know one two three then go and then you know put your arms back and then how to land properly

1680
03:01:56.16 --> 03:02:02.08
and stuff but it was it was definitely a kick in the pants I'm gonna do it again probably yes

1681
03:02:02.08 --> 03:02:08.000
with him I'm nuts and even in the hospital we're talking about my frontal brain low bangery

1682
03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:12.56
the doctors told my parents we can never be trusted with a credit card anymore he might just

1683
03:02:12.56 --> 03:02:17.12
be at work and take all this clothes off my mom's like wait in make good decisions to be

1684
03:02:17.12 --> 03:02:24.08
again with so he's not gonna lose much there it affected me to an extent but didn't affect

1685
03:02:24.08 --> 03:02:32.72
me to the extent where it could have thankfully so I also do I kind of I couldn't shoot blind

1686
03:02:32.72 --> 03:02:39.92
with special optics so how does that work um on top of your rifle where scope would

1687
03:02:39.92 --> 03:02:49.12
sit you have like it's like a high speed video camera that has built in Wi-Fi and it projects to

1688
03:02:49.12 --> 03:02:57.36
a tablet or a smartphone and basically it'll show on tablet or a smartphone like a site picture

1689
03:02:57.36 --> 03:03:03.44
of a scope and you got to you know a system gunner a gunner and they tell me left right

1690
03:03:03.44 --> 03:03:09.60
up or down and as long as I my breathing is controlled and I don't jerk the trigger I can hit a pie

1691
03:03:09.60 --> 03:03:18.72
plate of 300 meters every time since I've been blind I've shot five deer two bucks and three

1692
03:03:18.72 --> 03:03:27.52
dose I got two alligators in Louisiana with a we had a glass pistol with a laser sight and I

1693
03:03:27.52 --> 03:03:32.96
remember before watching that show swamp people and I can see I said they're nuts I said you would

1694
03:03:32.96 --> 03:03:39.04
never catch me in a million years doing that so opportunity came up hey Joe you want to go get her

1695
03:03:39.04 --> 03:03:45.04
hunting oh yeah sure I guess that goes back to my poor decision making and I take it there was

1696
03:03:45.04 --> 03:03:50.72
some pucker factor going on there buddy so I'm with another guy from fast and we were with the

1697
03:03:50.72 --> 03:03:59.28
guy we were with his brother as a de agent and he with this guy works and then the oil business out

1698
03:03:59.28 --> 03:04:07.44
and Louisiana in northern area and he does the gator hunting so we go to our couple of our lines

1699
03:04:07.44 --> 03:04:14.24
and if the listeners and whoever said they've ever seen how they catch them you have a big

1700
03:04:14.24 --> 03:04:20.24
like trouble hook with chicken on it and they set them up in the gator by such a game and

1701
03:04:20.24 --> 03:04:25.68
gets caught in this hook and then you have to go and pull the gator up and then you got a shoot him

1702
03:04:25.68 --> 03:04:31.76
now in the show like swamp people they gank on the line to try to get the gator to go nuts for

1703
03:04:31.76 --> 03:04:37.44
the atrics for tv now how you want to do it you want to pull them off slow so they don't fight

1704
03:04:37.44 --> 03:04:43.28
and a gator can only stand or water for so long and yada yada yada yada so we pulled to the first

1705
03:04:43.28 --> 03:04:49.44
couple lines and they're not touched so we pulled to the third line and he's like oh shit we got a big one

1706
03:04:49.44 --> 03:04:57.84
he goes on the bank he's got the chicken in his mouth he's about a ten footer so we roll up in this

1707
03:04:57.84 --> 03:05:06.000
little John boat and we get to the line and the guy started to pull him in so on my my knees

1708
03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:11.36
I got this clock with the laser sight on it 40 caliber clock you know and I could just press the

1709
03:05:11.36 --> 03:05:15.92
the pattern laser sight you know when we're ready and he can kind of guide me in for the shot

1710
03:05:15.92 --> 03:05:23.36
so we're he's pulling the gator in and the gator gets under the boat he's like oh shit

1711
03:05:25.12 --> 03:05:31.36
so he's like okay we're not going to force this he's got eventually come up

1712
03:05:32.56 --> 03:05:37.36
so I'm thinking you got the gator snout not too far from me I'm on my knees and I'm like Joe

1713
03:05:38.24 --> 03:05:44.08
what the hell you doing out here I'm like you're blind and at this gator snaps

1714
03:05:44.08 --> 03:05:48.72
to bite you you can't even see the jump back and then these locals are gonna be up

1715
03:05:49.44 --> 03:05:53.68
you know we're gonna see after the fact that's certain right ain't no blind guy in no business

1716
03:05:53.68 --> 03:05:58.000
out there anyway even tailed that guy even to see the blind out there hunting alligator to get my arm

1717
03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:04.32
bit off so believe me there was some pucker factor so the gator starts

1718
03:06:04.32 --> 03:06:08.88
I like the fact that not only your little word you might lose your arm from a gator but you also

1719
03:06:08.88 --> 03:06:13.28
don't want to look stupid and for exactly for you know it's always a key thing you got to look cool

1720
03:06:13.28 --> 03:06:23.28
you know you can there now there's the blind guy one hour you know so the gator starts fighting

1721
03:06:23.28 --> 03:06:31.68
a little bit and the guy is like shit he bent the hook and got off so he's like okay keep your eye

1722
03:06:31.68 --> 03:06:36.16
on my buddies there with his pistol and he's got he takes the glock he's got a surface

1723
03:06:37.52 --> 03:06:41.68
he can only stay down for so long so he goes look for the bubble so he goes I see bubbles

1724
03:06:41.68 --> 03:06:49.44
he he goes he's coming up so he shoots some pow it's a head hit some again pow and the buddy

1725
03:06:49.44 --> 03:06:55.20
I'm with he so I shoot him too he goes yeah so he shoots some so we go over to the gator

1726
03:06:55.84 --> 03:07:00.000
and then we push him to the shore to try to get this big SOB on the boat

1727
03:07:01.28 --> 03:07:06.64
so as we're trying to get him on the boat I hear another shot the gators already got three

1728
03:07:06.64 --> 03:07:12.80
bullets in his head he opens his eyes again so the guy hits him in the head again hit he's done so

1729
03:07:12.80 --> 03:07:17.36
he got this big big gator on the boat so it takes off all the rooms so we have to drop him off

1730
03:07:17.76 --> 03:07:22.56
to try to check other lines and we went to our next line he had like a nine foot around there

1731
03:07:22.56 --> 03:07:27.60
and he was putting up more of a fight and I got to shoot that one twice so that was kind of

1732
03:07:28.72 --> 03:07:35.60
kind of interesting how box actually I was in Sun Valley Idaho last year

1733
03:07:35.60 --> 03:07:41.44
during hyperbaric oxygen train retreatments because it increases stem saw activity

1734
03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:45.84
trying to get a little more sight back and I got to downhill snow ski three times

1735
03:07:46.80 --> 03:07:52.56
I did that when I was younger and it's kind of kind of counterintuitive a skin you want to lean forward

1736
03:07:53.52 --> 03:07:58.08
in blind you don't want to lean forward when you're walking but you want to crack your head on things

1737
03:07:58.08 --> 03:08:03.12
and I've actually got stitches a couple times and my eyebrows since I lost my sight but I was in a hurry

1738
03:08:03.12 --> 03:08:10.24
so that was fun that was on my bucket list I tried slalom water skiing at our cottage up

1739
03:08:10.24 --> 03:08:16.64
north this last year I used to ski a lot when I was young I just I popped up but I couldn't get my

1740
03:08:17.20 --> 03:08:22.72
other foot in the rear boot I couldn't my balance was off with blind so I tried a couple times

1741
03:08:22.72 --> 03:08:32.88
and at least I tried so I did that I ran 5k races blind and I've actually

1742
03:08:32.88 --> 03:08:43.68
lost July I as you know I'm a little guy I became the first blind I have been me men's

1743
03:08:43.68 --> 03:08:53.20
pro bodybuilder in history got my pro card so I did that and you know the sky's the limit you know

1744
03:08:53.20 --> 03:08:59.12
there's different things you know you can do and you can't cry over spilled milk and you can

1745
03:08:59.12 --> 03:09:05.04
just control what you can control and a lot of people ask me you know what are some of the hardest

1746
03:09:05.04 --> 03:09:11.36
things getting used to being blind you I think one of the biggest thing you lose your independence

1747
03:09:12.40 --> 03:09:16.80
I just can't get in the car and go somewhere myself or if I want to work out I just can't go by

1748
03:09:16.80 --> 03:09:24.88
myself and so you have to rely on other people and you know I'm typical like the you know the law

1749
03:09:24.88 --> 03:09:30.96
enforcement guy or the real type A what do I think by myself you know you can't you know if

1750
03:09:30.96 --> 03:09:35.04
you're following behind and I'm just gonna take over you know you know you want to do it right

1751
03:09:35.04 --> 03:09:40.64
do it yourself I have to learn how to slow it out and trust other people and which was probably

1752
03:09:40.64 --> 03:09:47.92
good for me I had to learn to ask for help I wasn't good at that before but lucky I have a very good

1753
03:09:47.92 --> 03:09:55.20
base of friends and teammates and family and DEA has really stepped up since I've been hurt

1754
03:09:56.000 --> 03:10:02.96
myself or my family has never been without anything and at first being in crowds really freaked me out

1755
03:10:04.08 --> 03:10:10.48
because being in law enforcement for as long as I have you're always taught to be aware

1756
03:10:10.48 --> 03:10:24.40
you're surroundings I know you're not supposed to you know I'm trying to think of the

1757
03:10:24.40 --> 03:10:37.28
word you know oh god it'll come to me but I was getting on this subject I was getting

1758
03:10:37.28 --> 03:10:44.48
debriefed by like a psychologist situation and really we I felt that some form they're like

1759
03:10:44.48 --> 03:10:51.44
one of the things was like you know do you feel comfortable in crowds and I said you feel comfortable

1760
03:10:51.44 --> 03:10:58.32
in crowds and I was like well no and so you know those side card trist it's a female she looks

1761
03:10:58.32 --> 03:11:03.28
at you see you know you she said you say you don't feel very comfortable in crowds and this was like

1762
03:11:03.28 --> 03:11:08.80
I mean I I was back for my rack but you know whatever a little bit of time and she says you

1763
03:11:08.80 --> 03:11:13.20
don't feel very comfortable in crowds and I said well no not really and she goes well why is that

1764
03:11:13.92 --> 03:11:20.000
and I go well you know this terrors in America right yeah and she looked like she like whatever

1765
03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:25.44
she started taking copious notes you know about my mental health or whatever which I was just like

1766
03:11:25.44 --> 03:11:29.04
hey it's a reality you know it's a reality you know it's a reality you know it was always

1767
03:11:29.04 --> 03:11:34.64
want to be aware of your surroundings okay where are my entrances where are my exit you know

1768
03:11:34.64 --> 03:11:40.88
who looks suspicious who doesn't you know you're not trying to like stare you know type people but

1769
03:11:40.88 --> 03:11:49.68
it's all what doesn't look right and at first being blind things sound to people

1770
03:11:49.68 --> 03:11:55.20
were sound to closer than what they were or farther than what they were I was just real uneasy

1771
03:11:55.20 --> 03:12:01.84
but over time I'd learn to deal with that so I'm not as jittery and stuff as I once was I just

1772
03:12:01.84 --> 03:12:10.08
learned to you know trust the people around me and so you know that's one of the things people asked

1773
03:12:10.08 --> 03:12:19.28
me do I have a service dog I don't I put in for one but then I got my left eye I had a chance to

1774
03:12:19.28 --> 03:12:24.16
get an artificial corny in my left eye and they thought I could get back more vision than I did

1775
03:12:24.16 --> 03:12:28.24
so I didn't want to take a dog from somebody who needed it more and the art of the

1776
03:12:28.24 --> 03:12:37.04
person corny helped me seal a little better but not as much as we had hoped for so I still might

1777
03:12:37.04 --> 03:12:42.48
get a service dog in the future they're pretty incredible what they can do. Yeah very incredible and

1778
03:12:45.44 --> 03:12:49.68
you know people asked me do I get headaches and stuff like that and no I never had a headache thank

1779
03:12:49.68 --> 03:12:57.84
God because people asked that question and you know they ask me you know what is you know what can

1780
03:12:57.84 --> 03:13:04.000
you see what can you can see like I said earlier I can see shapes I can see light I can see some movement

1781
03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:12.000
and I chart my left eye is 2400 to 2500 depending on the day anything over 2200 is the

1782
03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:18.80
glee blind my right eye is nothing that's the side of bullet one into. I doctor shines of light I said

1783
03:13:18.80 --> 03:13:27.68
I can think I can see a light but there's future with my left eye I have artificial cornea so

1784
03:13:29.44 --> 03:13:34.08
there's help the thing is limiting my sight is my optic nerve and retina still very damaged

1785
03:13:34.88 --> 03:13:41.76
but they are working on stem cell for that to regenerate that and they're still fairly confident

1786
03:13:41.76 --> 03:13:50.40
in two to five years I could get more sight back which which would be nice and if I do that would

1787
03:13:50.40 --> 03:13:56.16
be great but if not you know I'm still gonna keep soldier and on and do what you know and do what the hell

1788
03:13:57.36 --> 03:14:01.04
you know I can do and they said you know you don't want to be the first for anything you want to

1789
03:14:01.04 --> 03:14:06.08
let them work the kinks out of this this stuff first you know before we had all this mess with

1790
03:14:06.08 --> 03:14:10.40
China you heard him doing the stem cells and everything over there and I asked my doctor so I go to the

1791
03:14:10.40 --> 03:14:16.48
S best eye doctors that I can now to like you don't want to go over there Joe when the technology is good

1792
03:14:17.36 --> 03:14:24.56
and it works we'll have it here too so you know just on standby to stand by for that

1793
03:14:25.28 --> 03:14:31.52
you know so you know we'll keep going that I do my motivational speaking which gives me purpose now

1794
03:14:32.16 --> 03:14:36.96
you know we've been you know took jobs and different things we're to serve people and serve the

1795
03:14:36.96 --> 03:14:44.88
community I can't do my job the way I have in the past but for me to get up there and talk to

1796
03:14:44.88 --> 03:14:53.84
people and tell my story one is therapeutic for me too to talk about it and two if somebody's

1797
03:14:53.84 --> 03:15:01.60
having a bad day a bad year or bad whatever that the sea there's always somebody that has it

1798
03:15:01.60 --> 03:15:08.08
worse it always could be worse so you know you got to count the blessings you have and be thankful

1799
03:15:08.72 --> 03:15:15.76
for the things that you still have you can't cry about what you don't have anymore all you can just

1800
03:15:15.76 --> 03:15:22.80
do is move on so you know I'm gonna continue doing the motivational speaking which is good you know

1801
03:15:22.80 --> 03:15:28.24
and there's been groups I've talked to where I've got after action reports where people in the audience

1802
03:15:28.24 --> 03:15:35.76
have we're gonna commit suicide and they heard me talk and they said my life's really not that bad

1803
03:15:36.64 --> 03:15:42.88
you know I can do it you know so I tell people you know if I can do it you can do it you know I

1804
03:15:42.88 --> 03:15:47.92
always had a strong will and I've always been very stubborn I kind of helped me survive but the

1805
03:15:47.92 --> 03:15:52.64
stubbornness isn't always a good in relationships you know it was like it'd be a pain in the

1806
03:15:52.64 --> 03:16:02.16
butt just asked my girlfriend you know and I do really preach the PTSD part two was

1807
03:16:02.16 --> 03:16:10.40
losing way too many men and women for that so if you had you have it and I always knew I had it

1808
03:16:10.40 --> 03:16:16.80
but I didn't get better until I admitted I had it but it's why I was still working I was afraid I was

1809
03:16:16.80 --> 03:16:24.48
gonna lose my security clearance and this and that and in all actuality I would not have but you know

1810
03:16:24.48 --> 03:16:30.16
there's things and treatments and things you can do for that like the Stelegangly and Block Shot is

1811
03:16:30.88 --> 03:16:36.24
one a great thing for that you know finding a good fit with a therapist you know that

1812
03:16:37.04 --> 03:16:40.96
you know can work with you so all those things important so to me I tell people

1813
03:16:40.96 --> 03:16:48.80
it's my show to say you have it it's not my show to have it and say you don't have it you know

1814
03:16:48.80 --> 03:16:54.64
so don't be you know a tough guy or tough gal there's help out there please you know seek that help

1815
03:16:55.84 --> 03:17:03.44
yeah yeah I know it's for me you know one of my guys Ryan Job was also shot in the head

1816
03:17:03.44 --> 03:17:11.44
and he also ended up losing his vision and unfortunately after that you know after one of the

1817
03:17:11.44 --> 03:17:15.12
surgeries one of the many surgeries that he went through there was some there was some medical

1818
03:17:15.12 --> 03:17:25.28
complications and he passed away but it's it's for me you know meeting you seeing you talking to

1819
03:17:25.28 --> 03:17:31.92
you you know you had this you have the same kind of attitude that he had you know he he had been

1820
03:17:31.92 --> 03:17:38.72
blind and he was doing all kinds of things he was climbing Mount Ranier he was he had shot a bull elk

1821
03:17:39.44 --> 03:17:43.52
you know he was doing the kind of stuff that you're doing so it's it's awesome for me to see

1822
03:17:44.16 --> 03:17:49.36
someone in your situation that has the same exact attitude that Ryan Job had just just a

1823
03:17:49.36 --> 03:17:54.48
just a warrior badass that just was still driving on regardless oh I've one of the things

1824
03:17:54.48 --> 03:18:02.24
if we got to another animal that I shot this past year I went to West Virginia and I shot a

1825
03:18:02.24 --> 03:18:12.16
black bear so it was a female bear and I named it Penelope after the fact I got that stuff so that's

1826
03:18:12.16 --> 03:18:18.56
my little Penelope what are the workouts you just do your normal workouts that you used to do for

1827
03:18:18.56 --> 03:18:24.16
bodybuilding in the first place you and I've been doing it for so I might very first bodybuilding

1828
03:18:24.16 --> 03:18:29.52
show was in 1993 I did the Central States of Michigan after college I was still looking to some

1829
03:18:29.52 --> 03:18:34.96
big pet it I've always been a big guy and I'm pretty knowledgeable about nutrition and the

1830
03:18:34.96 --> 03:18:39.68
workouts and stuff but I'm also smart enough to know there's always somebody who knows more than you

1831
03:18:40.24 --> 03:18:45.44
so maybe I'm blind I can't see how I look I'm kind of feeling I'm getting leaner and this and that

1832
03:18:45.44 --> 03:18:54.64
so I do have a coach so my coach I check in at least right now in the offseason every week

1833
03:18:55.44 --> 03:19:01.84
send them pictures or videos how I'm looking and answering questions you know how is my appetite

1834
03:19:02.88 --> 03:19:08.32
how am I feeling this way in that way you know getting blood work all the time to make sure

1835
03:19:08.32 --> 03:19:14.72
everything is functional often the course I spent a shit ton of money on supplements and the

1836
03:19:14.72 --> 03:19:19.84
coach kind of guy sees my okay you know we all you know you need to do maybe some work

1837
03:19:19.84 --> 03:19:28.000
fat burning cardio you know we'll range your diet this way and also he sends me workouts too to follow

1838
03:19:28.64 --> 03:19:33.84
you know depending on the time of year you know depending on the workout and the rep range and

1839
03:19:33.84 --> 03:19:40.16
the amount of cardio I'm doing so it's important too you have to have a good coach you can trust

1840
03:19:40.16 --> 03:19:45.04
too that's good but a lot of these coaches on front blow smoke up their client spots oh you look

1841
03:19:45.04 --> 03:19:50.000
great you're going to be Mr. Olympia and this and that and it can't even win a local show you know

1842
03:19:50.64 --> 03:19:55.28
it's like you know I've rather have somebody be honest with me you know hey Joe you know you

1843
03:19:55.28 --> 03:20:00.000

1844
03:20:00.000 --> 03:20:05.84
corrections I need to make or maybe we're going to have to wait on you know and do a later competition

1845
03:20:05.84 --> 03:20:13.68
so you know we'll see what the future holds you know if I get some more sight back I would like to do

1846
03:20:14.08 --> 03:20:20.88
you know some tactical training with people maybe some firearms training get more sight back I could be

1847
03:20:22.16 --> 03:20:26.72
a coach for people getting ready for competitions but I couldn't just find now if I can't see

1848
03:20:26.72 --> 03:20:32.40
all they look I can't really do a effective job you know so keep moving forward with those things

1849
03:20:32.40 --> 03:20:41.44
and of any other opportunities pop up you know you know be willing to do those things and you know

1858
03:21:32.08 --> 03:21:38.000
all talk to you awesome awesome echo you got any questions well yeah rewind a little bit

1859
03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:46.72
back to Afghanistan uh heroin poppies and who's growing that and why how the the teller man

1860
03:21:46.72 --> 03:21:53.12
makes the farmers grow it and the teller band is growing that because that's their money source

1861
03:21:53.12 --> 03:22:01.28
income okay so who do they sell that to a lot of that heroin goes to Europe we get some of it

1862
03:22:01.28 --> 03:22:06.64
over here on the United States but the great majority of it goes to the European consumers okay

1863
03:22:06.64 --> 03:22:12.40
got it so you just like you know in Colombia and stuff like that Afghanistan is yet just another hub for

1864
03:22:12.40 --> 03:22:18.40
another media yes and you know it's some you know a real big country that consumes out heroin is

1865
03:22:18.40 --> 03:22:23.76
actually Russia too they have a pretty bad heroin problem there but you know it's a big money and

1866
03:22:23.76 --> 03:22:28.64
that's you know what funds they're in search and seeing the problem is now that we're gone out of

1867
03:22:28.64 --> 03:22:36.88
Afghanistan and how it's crazy there again they're just growing uncontrolled and like I said when we were

1868
03:22:36.88 --> 03:22:44.80
hitting them hard we didn't eradicated but you can see it was having an effect but now it's just you

1869
03:22:44.80 --> 03:22:53.76
know bonds I it's open now okay that must be as you look at like drugs you you spent so much time

1870
03:22:53.76 --> 03:22:59.36
in the DA when you hear people talk about legalizing drugs what's your what's your thoughts on that

1871
03:23:00.16 --> 03:23:06.80
and this is this my thoughts only um I have talked to numerous numerous drug addicts

1872
03:23:06.80 --> 03:23:16.48
and the common drug that they start with is marijuana and in my opinion without a doubt

1873
03:23:17.60 --> 03:23:23.36
it's a gateway drug and the marijuana that's out there now it's not the same marijuana they're

1874
03:23:23.36 --> 03:23:29.84
even was 5 or 7 years ago it's so strong you know and it could lead the other things and you know

1875
03:23:29.84 --> 03:23:36.56
we could you have a whole debate on that and every state that it's legalized um the auto

1876
03:23:36.56 --> 03:23:43.28
accidents has really increased you know it's still illegal federally you know and and for some medical

1877
03:23:43.28 --> 03:23:51.28
conditions you know I can see that it could be useful for but in my opinion a lot of people who use it

1878
03:23:51.28 --> 03:23:57.52
say under the vise of medical it's just to get high you know and that's this that's this my opinion

1879
03:23:59.68 --> 03:24:01.68
well Joe you got any closing thoughts

1880
03:24:01.68 --> 03:24:08.32
just um everybody out there to soliciting you know like I said there's a wilderness away

1881
03:24:08.32 --> 03:24:13.60
if you want to get something done you can get it done and just you know have that have that mindset

1882
03:24:14.16 --> 03:24:19.76
and just keep going and if things get bad or down tomorrow's a new day make it through that day

1883
03:24:19.76 --> 03:24:26.72
wake up the next day and give that next day hell awesome man thanks for joining us

1884
03:24:26.72 --> 03:24:32.16
appreciate you coming on here appreciate you sharing these lessons that you've learned and and most

1885
03:24:32.16 --> 03:24:37.20
important thank you for thank you for your incredible service and your incredible sacrifice

1886
03:24:37.20 --> 03:24:43.84
for our nation and thanks for what you're doing today going around talking to people being here

1887
03:24:43.84 --> 03:24:50.32
just continuing to inspire people to overcome whatever whatever adversity that they're facing

1888
03:24:51.12 --> 03:24:56.16
it's incredible example that you set for all of us so thank you for being here and thanks for everything

1889
03:24:56.16 --> 03:25:03.92
you do you quite welcome as my honor and privilege with that Joe pure sante has left the building

1890
03:25:04.96 --> 03:25:12.16
echo which is it that oh so I'm used to and you mentioned this before too where

1891
03:25:13.12 --> 03:25:20.24
very used at this point very used to you know military guys coming up their mindset their

1892
03:25:20.24 --> 03:25:25.76
experiences stuff like that it was interesting even though it wasn't a huge deviation I don't think

1893
03:25:26.64 --> 03:25:34.08
but it was like enough of a deviation to seem like a big change to go law enforcement you know

1894
03:25:34.08 --> 03:25:40.40
and it particularly particularly I didn't grow up around drugs at all like I don't think I've

1895
03:25:40.40 --> 03:25:45.60
ever even you haven't been to 500 math house no chef cook what math labs labs

1896
03:25:45.60 --> 03:25:55.12
what yeah what he call it cook lab say labs or clan clan destiny clan destiny lab

1897
03:25:55.92 --> 03:26:03.52
unit or something yeah oh no the answers no I have not I've never seen math before I've never

1898
03:26:03.52 --> 03:26:10.000
seen I've seen cook before I've never seen her and before I've seen weed before weed is only one

1899
03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:18.72
mm-hmm I'm it's I've seen a crack head with an empty crack pipe I don't think I've ever seen

1900
03:26:18.72 --> 03:26:26.16
real crack before check well well definitely you could probably tell I was exploring the

1901
03:26:26.16 --> 03:26:31.76
the police side of things and especially you know the the investigations side of things and

1902
03:26:31.76 --> 03:26:37.52
I set up because that's let's face it that's all stuff that I'm not super familiar with and it's

1903
03:26:37.52 --> 03:26:43.12
very interesting because it's all about human nature you know informants and dealers and police

1904
03:26:43.12 --> 03:26:47.12
it's you know that's why they make all those movies about that kind of stuff because there's drama there

1905
03:26:47.12 --> 03:26:53.04
right there's humans interacting you know in really stressful life changing environments

1906
03:26:53.04 --> 03:26:59.12
yeah and so yeah definitely was interesting and and that's her you know he's he had a really

1907
03:26:59.12 --> 03:27:05.52
I mean he's had a very interesting life to say the least yeah I mean you could probably write a book

1908
03:27:05.52 --> 03:27:11.52
about that one big bus or the other big bus or the one big you know you could write a book about

1909
03:27:11.52 --> 03:27:16.72
any of those things yeah and it would be very interesting and fascinating and you'd learn a lot

1910
03:27:16.72 --> 03:27:22.08
so he's done that over and over and over again and then went to Afghanistan and then had a

1911
03:27:22.08 --> 03:27:30.40
had a hit on his head in Honduras right I started thinking you know being in like being an iraq

1912
03:27:30.40 --> 03:27:33.76
when you're out on patrol you think someone might try and kill you you think they

1913
03:27:33.76 --> 03:27:42.32
all try to kill like you or someone near you it's not you at least I never felt that way

1914
03:27:42.32 --> 03:27:48.08
I never felt like you know the bullets that say I always make this joke hey you know bullet say

1915
03:27:48.64 --> 03:27:51.84
they don't you have a bullet with your name on it you have the bullet that says to whom it may

1916
03:27:51.84 --> 03:27:58.24
concern yeah he had bullets plural with his name on it I don't really like that feeling

1917
03:27:58.24 --> 03:28:02.96
I mean you want to talk about you think I'm paranoid right now which I am I'm paranoid about

1918
03:28:02.96 --> 03:28:11.44
stuff right now if that was going on yeah I would be in of levels 12 alert mode no one to be

1919
03:28:11.44 --> 03:28:19.12
getting near me it'd be pretty crazy to see I think yeah there's something very specifically

1920
03:28:19.12 --> 03:28:26.88
sinister about a plan to kill you to kill you specifically right right yeah I don't think no I

1921
03:28:26.88 --> 03:28:34.24
yeah no one's ever specifically said we're gonna kill Jocco other than Dean Lister made that one

1922
03:28:34.24 --> 03:28:40.56
uh CD yeah he did kill Jocco CD but it was just a CD that was just music he wasn't actually

1923
03:28:40.56 --> 03:28:46.000
trying to kill so it was somewhat of a conspiracy I will give him that the the Lawn

1924
03:28:46.000 --> 03:28:51.12
Firstman part of it too which so a lot of times when you start to talk about iraq afghanistan

1925
03:28:52.08 --> 03:28:56.000
and I understand what it does seem like okay that's a create that's a different time

1926
03:28:56.000 --> 03:29:01.60
in a faraway place but now he's over here talking about everything Dean Lister like all this

1927
03:29:01.60 --> 03:29:06.48
stuff and you're like man all this stuff right now is going on right now like probably pretty close

1928
03:29:06.48 --> 03:29:11.52
to here oh well so and currently going on right now this moment yes like you know this moment

1929
03:29:11.52 --> 03:29:15.68
there's an informant that's sitting buy in some drugs from somebody there's a bust about the

1930
03:29:15.68 --> 03:29:21.60
happened right now something that I've literally no exposure to so to me that is like oh that's kind

1931
03:29:21.60 --> 03:29:26.96
of crazy I did want to ask about lifting yeah but we would have been here for a while

1932
03:29:26.96 --> 03:29:31.36
time I'd been along I thought you would at least want to compare by set workouts with them

1933
03:29:31.36 --> 03:29:36.40
you know my man is getting his lift on well for sure which actually and I was gonna ask

1934
03:29:36.40 --> 03:29:43.20
him to but he said he's age 52 right now and if you can look like that at 52 I mean I don't

1935
03:29:43.20 --> 03:29:48.48
know if he's getting ready for a show or something like that but if you can look like that at

1936
03:29:48.48 --> 03:29:54.64
52 that's like it not only is it eye opening but like I'm letting you you know what let's just go

1937
03:29:54.64 --> 03:30:02.16
and restate that if you can look like that at 20 or 32 or 42 it's true yeah I'd be less surprised

1938
03:30:02.16 --> 03:30:07.92
but it does kind of set this a little bit better of a calibrated standard you know kind of gives

1939
03:30:07.92 --> 03:30:13.84
like those of us who want to maintain muscle mass will say yeah kind of gives you some hope on now

1940
03:30:13.84 --> 03:30:19.84
and you know he's not weak either oh for sure yeah and he didn't go into much but but I

1941
03:30:19.84 --> 03:30:24.72
I you know read some stuff about him and some bios and stuff but he won all kinds of like

1942
03:30:24.72 --> 03:30:31.44
you know awards for football and he's just a great athlete and just Jack and Steel so for sure

1943
03:30:31.44 --> 03:30:36.64
for those of us that want to maintain muscle mass have you ever met someone that didn't I guess

1944
03:30:36.64 --> 03:30:42.96
occasionally you get maybe a wrestler like a fighter or someone that's literally going down a

1945
03:30:42.96 --> 03:30:49.44
weight class below there what they can cut you know sometimes people say oh I'm resting at 172

1946
03:30:50.08 --> 03:30:58.40
I'm gonna go down to 162 and I'm already shredded so I'm going to lose muscle mass right

1947
03:30:58.40 --> 03:31:03.52
occasionally that might happen I think when people get into some if they get into some

1948
03:31:03.52 --> 03:31:07.36
endurance sports maybe like triathlon or something they might want to do some muscle mass maybe

1949
03:31:07.36 --> 03:31:12.96
yeah and I'm taught wait what are you asking like is there if you ever known something that said oh I'm really looking to

1950
03:31:12.96 --> 03:31:18.88
find it out how I can lose some muscle mass no negative a jett just for first formate

1951
03:31:18.88 --> 03:31:25.36
sake yes that's essentially it but that's a rare case um just life in general they say after age

1952
03:31:25.36 --> 03:31:31.28
whatever 30 or something like that like things like degenerate pretty quick or whatever

1953
03:31:31.28 --> 03:31:36.000
that's weird and then muscle mass is one of those things where if you just lifted like you're

1954
03:31:36.000 --> 03:31:42.08
gonna lose muscle mass as you get older straight up you're just gonna lose it uh my daughter was

1955
03:31:42.08 --> 03:31:47.04
telling me my daughter's in college and she's studying but she was I was up with her and she was

1956
03:31:47.04 --> 03:31:52.80
telling me that she was she's out there jack and steel and working out she got her little friend

1957
03:31:52.80 --> 03:31:58.32
group and they which is cool because they're a little friend group they're all in the working out

1958
03:31:58.32 --> 03:32:03.20
yeah it's good she turned in as she jits but she was telling me because she's studying

1959
03:32:03.20 --> 03:32:09.36
something some kind of canyzeology some kind of physiology I keep reading what they call it now

1960
03:32:09.36 --> 03:32:14.16
when I was younger so she studying nutrition science and what we used to call

1961
03:32:15.44 --> 03:32:20.80
exercise physiology was a minor people would get right they don't call that anymore I

1962
03:32:20.80 --> 03:32:25.04
figure what they call but that's what essentially canyzeology maybe that's what she I think that's

1963
03:32:25.04 --> 03:32:29.92
but that's different than exercise physiology she's studying stuff she's studying stuff

1964
03:32:29.92 --> 03:32:34.80
about working out okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay but she says she was saying

1965
03:32:34.80 --> 03:32:43.20
hey when you if you don't lift you immediately start like losing muscle degenerate yeah and it's not

1966
03:32:43.20 --> 03:32:48.08
it's not like I mean it doesn't matter like the process at the end of the day you're losing

1967
03:32:48.08 --> 03:32:54.32
you're losing your muscle and a lot most of its functionality move it or lose it yeah and then

1968
03:32:54.32 --> 03:33:00.56
resistance training which is lifting is the best one is the thing that induces muscle like growth

1969
03:33:00.56 --> 03:33:07.20
and or maintenance depending on big muscle so yeah it makes sense so basically go lift please

1970
03:33:07.20 --> 03:33:12.24
go work out you know I mean resistance rate that's another thing my daughter was saying

1971
03:33:12.24 --> 03:33:19.20
all your bones yes your bones if you're not putting your bones under pressure yeah now that's

1972
03:33:19.20 --> 03:33:23.12
because you could argue well you know running is good too which it is and you could say swimming

1973
03:33:23.12 --> 03:33:28.80
good too out that's good too but you gotta put weight on your body you gotta put resistance on your

1974
03:33:28.80 --> 03:33:37.20
body to make your bones stronger yeah yeah and that's the the point I think overall that I

1975
03:33:37.20 --> 03:33:43.28
get from that the beginning of what you're essentially saying is all kind of exercise has its

1976
03:33:43.28 --> 03:33:50.24
like major by the way when you compare it to no exercise all exercises have major benefits major

1977
03:33:50.24 --> 03:33:55.92
they're all different though so good so good all right so if you're working out which you are you

1978
03:33:55.92 --> 03:34:02.56
probably need some some fuel for you you get some jockel fuel jockel fuel dot com you can get

1979
03:34:02.56 --> 03:34:08.000
protein you know you could get protein from a lot of places you get it from stake recommended

1980
03:34:08.000 --> 03:34:13.12
chicken recommended sushi if you're not good Charles yes right yeah what percentage of

1981
03:34:13.12 --> 03:34:20.16
protein do you get from sushi like 70% and the other 30% is milk I would literally

1982
03:34:20.16 --> 03:34:25.84
say like literally probably like 50% not recently not but overall you may sushi at your house

1983
03:34:25.84 --> 03:34:30.88
ever no you just have to get a place yeah and you know your place do you know do you know

1984
03:34:30.88 --> 03:34:34.40
do they know your order already do you order the same thing all the time yes for your whole family

1985
03:34:34.40 --> 03:34:38.96
everyone's getting everything like everyone's getting the same you're the case the Charles residents

1986
03:34:38.96 --> 03:34:44.48
we need our food sign goes variable literally like you're I see your face and you're kind of making

1987
03:34:44.48 --> 03:34:51.20
a joke but I mean kind of I'm being serious the answer is yes yeah in fact I call the place

1988
03:34:51.20 --> 03:34:54.72
because there's a place literally walking distance from me they got to take out color ID yep

1989
03:34:54.72 --> 03:34:59.28
I'll say they say I haven't seen it yet no it's not in the office right

1990
03:34:59.28 --> 03:35:04.16
I'm getting cut raw yeah yeah I'll call they'll be like hi I'll go how are you that's it that's

1991
03:35:04.16 --> 03:35:07.92
how they answer the phone yeah then I'll be like I want this I gotta say my order and she already

1992
03:35:07.92 --> 03:35:13.12
knows boom boom boom boom yes full of how much is the cost oh it depends so some days they're

1993
03:35:13.12 --> 03:35:18.48
closed or they closed late so if they closed it like 930 and there's another place that closed

1994
03:35:18.48 --> 03:35:24.16
that midnight so I'll get it delivered it that made it down's way more and that was like 100 bucks

1995
03:35:24.16 --> 03:35:31.04
per just for me okay yeah I'm about at the we're in the whole family no how about just you

1996
03:35:31.04 --> 03:35:38.000
at the regular spot oh like 60 so okay that's a good deal given given like what I get they have

1997
03:35:38.000 --> 03:35:43.68
good prices over there cocky sushi yeah well you probably gonna need some milk to watch that down

1998
03:35:43.68 --> 03:35:49.52
yes sir to get this sweetness because sushi's not sweet right is it no sir it is not sweet

1999
03:35:49.52 --> 03:35:55.04
and he gets the mochi ice cream afterwards I don't like mochi ice cream I don't like the taste like

2000
03:35:55.04 --> 03:36:00.64
um tastes like uncooked no bread around oh what what they call that what do they call

2001
03:36:00.64 --> 03:36:05.36
the taste like uncooked bread wrapped around a piece of ice cream who made that up right

2002
03:36:05.36 --> 03:36:13.44
we made that up right what makes it funny is how accurate you can are it is right in a way like

2003
03:36:13.44 --> 03:36:18.000
if you look at a certain way because it is essentially like a dough that's like dough okay

2004
03:36:18.000 --> 03:36:22.48
uncooked but it's like the rice dough like it's it's mochi that's why you know what mochi is

2005
03:36:22.48 --> 03:36:26.48
have you ever had mochi just mochi you know that wrapping that you're talking about it's just that

2006
03:36:28.48 --> 03:36:33.60
but it tastes good bread and how are you can get it oh man it's the best but my family was like

2007
03:36:33.60 --> 03:36:38.64
somehow amped about mochi and so they got me amped they got me hyped this size of a year's ago

2008
03:36:38.64 --> 03:36:43.36
they all you know we get this dessert like we had to go somewhere to get it right so we get in the car

2009
03:36:43.36 --> 03:36:51.36
we go we're gonna get mochi I get mine I'm like I'm the mine's cook because it does taste good

2010
03:36:51.36 --> 03:36:55.92
right it's like dough what you said is dough is it mochi ice cream yeah there's yeah

2011
03:36:55.92 --> 03:36:59.92
then there's there's ice cream in the middle of it but you happen to be said dough what was the

2012
03:36:59.92 --> 03:37:04.16
point yeah that should do that why would do that you are right because it's not that sweet either

2013
03:37:04.16 --> 03:37:10.64
so you're like oh I feel like my like no it's not so anyway all right so if you're not into mochi ice cream

2014
03:37:10.64 --> 03:37:14.88
and you what cuz mochi ice cream is just ice cream really so that's not healthy mocha on the other hand

2015
03:37:14.88 --> 03:37:20.48
no the way we're protein mochi mochi mochi doesn't matter like dough does taste like dry flour

2016
03:37:20.48 --> 03:37:26.64
dough is it odd that I'm like there's a tiny tiny part of me that's kind of insulted that

2017
03:37:26.64 --> 03:37:31.76
you don't like mochi or mochi ice cream it's like I'm like talking you never have that feeling

2018
03:37:31.76 --> 03:37:37.04
where it's like one time okay so I'm a picky eater right I'm a picky eater I don't like a

2019
03:37:37.04 --> 03:37:42.88
bunch of different foods I was out with my wife one time this is what she was my wife she was just

2020
03:37:42.88 --> 03:37:48.000
a girl that I had met but I was kind of into her like a lot right but hey so I'm a your current wife

2021
03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:54.72
correct wife yes I don't wife back then but we were going out and she wanted me to try something

2022
03:37:54.72 --> 03:38:00.08
something I knew I didn't like I think it was yogurt but not yogurt you know I'm an American

2023
03:38:00.80 --> 03:38:07.36
I'm an American that grew up in the 80s so so yogurt to me was a freaking dan in yogurt you

2024
03:38:07.36 --> 03:38:13.44
know filled with sugar and blueberries like sauce on the bottom like that's the same

2025
03:38:13.44 --> 03:38:18.000
those things are good cuz they're filled with sugar so but this was we were we were overseas

2026
03:38:18.000 --> 03:38:25.12
and I had already made the mistake of thinking that yogurt overseas equated to a dan in

2027
03:38:25.12 --> 03:38:30.48
sugar filled yogurt that I ate when I was 12 years old and eight nine of them because they

2028
03:38:30.48 --> 03:38:35.44
tasted good but I realized that what other people ate yogurt it was just as weird tasting

2029
03:38:35.44 --> 03:38:42.88
whatever with weird cucumbers and then or something not so anyways my wife who wasn't my wife

2030
03:38:42.88 --> 03:38:48.40
yeah she's oh she's from England so she's all nice or whatever oh try this and I go oh no it's okay

2031
03:38:48.40 --> 03:38:52.48
I don't really like that she goes now just try she's she had the same attitude that you're

2032
03:38:52.48 --> 03:38:58.32
implying right now like she was kind of mad yeah as if you know as if you're saying oh I

2033
03:38:58.32 --> 03:39:01.76
you don't like air but what do you mean you don't like air of course you like air she's like

2034
03:39:01.76 --> 03:39:05.36
oh no no just try it's just it's yogurt it's good I go now I don't like this you know

2035
03:39:06.000 --> 03:39:12.08
you know just try it and she started escalating kind of it and poached it's okay you know I take a

2036
03:39:12.08 --> 03:39:20.64
little spoonful it's freaking disgusting I knew it was I mean it was you know so so so mochi

2037
03:39:20.64 --> 03:39:27.36
whatever ice cream is in that bad yeah I can stomach it but I'm not gonna make an effort to eat it

2038
03:39:27.36 --> 03:39:34.48
now moke I will make effort to eat moke is you you get that hey I will do what it takes to get some

2039
03:39:34.48 --> 03:39:42.32
moke up in here you know I last night had a moke shake double with a ham it wasn't ham is turkey sandwich

2040
03:39:42.32 --> 03:39:48.32
boom that's a full that's a that's a pleasurable scenario yeah you know I know it was the basic moke

2041
03:39:48.32 --> 03:39:54.40
shake by the way what's basic just the milk it was lactose free milk okay because I had it for

2042
03:39:54.40 --> 03:40:00.08
some other stuff as me and just regular moke that's it no no banana no nothing but you got that

2043
03:40:00.08 --> 03:40:07.28
little Sammy on and then you put down that moke that's a quality scenario right there you go oh yeah

2044
03:40:07.28 --> 03:40:12.24
yeah and it was like no matter if I was into the extra protein at the time and it was but even if I

2045
03:40:12.24 --> 03:40:20.000
wasn't it's like kind of like a cool little shock like a good job of fuel calm I could get the

2051
03:40:58.56 --> 03:41:04.88
origin geese out there lot of origin geese out there people want to buy origin geese because they know

2052
03:41:04.88 --> 03:41:12.08
that they're made in America I saw I don't know what you call it a mini doc it it was video

2053
03:41:12.08 --> 03:41:17.44
about like American manufacturing or it was about manufacturing and they were just it was talking

2054
03:41:17.44 --> 03:41:22.48
about what kind of the history of it or whatever and the reasons that you know whether be China or

2055
03:41:22.48 --> 03:41:27.44
all the foot like it's kind of like they they kind of have to do the manufacturing for all these

2056
03:41:27.44 --> 03:41:32.000
different reasons and it depends on the product and all this stuff right but they kind of have to do it

2057
03:41:32.000 --> 03:41:38.72
otherwise it's kind of like that was kind of the storyline but then there were there a few exceptions

2058
03:41:38.72 --> 03:41:44.16
in there that they didn't go specific on but they were just like trying to doing this this because of

2059
03:41:44.16 --> 03:41:48.24
this and to do it anywhere else it's like it's it's just unrealistic you know kind of a thing

2060
03:41:49.36 --> 03:41:54.32
but then all the exceptions when I kind of like deduced all the exceptions I was like oh wait that's

2061
03:41:54.32 --> 03:42:00.16
why origin can do all this stuff they do have to make certain sacrifices but with the sacrifices comes

2062
03:42:00.16 --> 03:42:04.88
like more basically the detriments that that places like China or whatever they call them what are they

2063
03:42:04.88 --> 03:42:12.64
called affordable labor affordable labor it's freaking slave labor bro yeah um it's kind of like

2064
03:42:12.64 --> 03:42:20.16
that for example but here you get basically each laborer or whatever they have like actual quality

2065
03:42:20.16 --> 03:42:26.16
of life oh that reflects on the end product kind of a thing so anyway you can kind of go

2066
03:42:26.16 --> 03:42:30.48
down the line and be like oh I see but here's the thing at the end of the my point is it's like what

2067
03:42:30.48 --> 03:42:36.48
they do is like dang that's kind of not kind of that's like that's a very unique thing that they're

thank you for your service here on the home front and

2120
03:48:16.24 --> 03:48:25.12
everyone else out there well what excuses do you possibly have right if someone like jop

2121
03:48:25.12 --> 03:48:31.12
can go through what he's gone through can suffer what he suffered can still go out there every day

2122
03:48:31.12 --> 03:48:38.40
and get after it and you know he said something he said you can't make a case it behind a desk

2123
03:48:40.16 --> 03:48:45.28
and that's some pretty good advice not just for law enforcement but for life

2124
03:48:46.72 --> 03:48:52.000
what you have to do is go out there every single day and get after it

2125
03:48:52.000 --> 03:48:59.36
until next time this is echo and jokko out
