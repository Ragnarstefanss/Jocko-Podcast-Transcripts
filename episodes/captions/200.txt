[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 200. With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening,
[00:00:06] I'm good evening.
[00:00:10] In the morning, after my swim, I sit down and have a cup of coffee and think,
[00:00:17] Jim, you're the luckiest guy in the world.
[00:00:21] And that is a quote from a man named James Sersley, a man who served his country.
[00:00:33] That's a soldier in the US Army. So he volunteered for the Army and then volunteered
[00:00:40] to go fight and Vietnam, a man who made incredible sacrifices and who faced incredible
[00:00:50] challenges. Challenges that would overwhelm most people. And yet he carried on. And he proved
[00:01:06] and is still proving that the human will is stronger than many of us ever realized. And
[00:01:20] if you have the right attitude, you can look at a harrowing situation and still call it
[00:01:32] lucky. And it is an honor to have this man with us tonight to talk about his experiences
[00:01:42] and how he has overcome so much adversity. Mr. James Sersley, welcome to the show.
[00:01:50] Thank you. Great to be here. Jocco. Sir, honor to have you on. And I apologize that the fact
[00:01:56] that you had to travel all the way out here from Sunny Florida to Sunny San Diego, but I'm
[00:02:01] honored that you were able to make the trip. I'm honored to be here again. Thanks for asking.
[00:02:05] And I like to start at the beginning about, you know, just where you came from, where you grew
[00:02:12] up. And I think we're talking about Minnesota, right? We are. You somehow you cover up that
[00:02:17] accent pretty well. Well, I've been living in Florida since 1971, so I hope I get rid of some of
[00:02:23] that. So you grew up, what kind of was the family situation growing up? What's your, what
[00:02:28] did you dad do and whatnot? My dad was a barber in Rochester, Minnesota, and my mother for the
[00:02:32] most part was a mother in a housewife and worked a little bit apart time when I got into my teenage
[00:02:39] years, along with my older sister was also a couple years older than me. And what's Rochester,
[00:02:45] Minnesota like? Well, Rochester, Minnesota is home of the Mayo Clinic. So I mean, it's probably
[00:02:51] that's the biggest thing in town and IBM, but it's rural, south eastern corner in Minnesota. Just
[00:02:58] great, bunch of patriotic Americans is what I was accustomed to growing up. And your dad served,
[00:03:05] if I'm correct, your dad served in the Army Air Corps? He did. He was a radio operator on B-17s
[00:03:11] and B-24s during World War II. Now, how much did he talk about that when you grow it up?
[00:03:17] You know, not really a whole lot. I think the biggest thing that I experienced with him was he
[00:03:21] had a foot locker that he brought back home, and I can remember probably as a nine or 10 year old kid
[00:03:27] trying to put on that stuff and have the jacket drape all over me and the pants too big and huge
[00:03:32] boots and everything else. But he never really said too much about another than, you know,
[00:03:37] where he experienced training in different parts of the United States and that type of thing.
[00:03:41] But he was a B-17 radio operator and B-24s. And B-20s. So was he doing the missions into Europe?
[00:03:50] He did not do it in, in, never left the United States. Okay. Because when he, when he finished
[00:03:55] whatever training he had, they made him a trainer of other radio operators. He got it. So he was lucky.
[00:04:01] Well, yeah, otherwise there's a good chance you wouldn't even be here exactly.
[00:04:05] Yeah, those are the, those are the guys that we're doing. If you did 25 missions,
[00:04:09] you got to go home. But there wasn't too many people that got to go home.
[00:04:16] So when you were growing up, I mean, going to high school, what was it? What was your, what were you into?
[00:04:22] Growing up? Football, basketball, and based in girls. And that's your which one was the greatest priority.
[00:04:31] And were you any good? I mean, I was starting full back on a football team for three different,
[00:04:37] you know, sophomore junior and senior year. And probably go to go into college. But I wasn't
[00:04:42] exactly the greatest student in the world. So I did make myself eligible to go on to college.
[00:04:48] You were focused on studying female anatomy at this point instead of.
[00:04:53] That would be a good interpretation. So, so were you planning to go to college?
[00:04:59] Were you thinking about going to college? Were your parents,
[00:05:01] edge and you towards college? My parents really never said too much about that. My older sister
[00:05:08] was already two years into college at that point. My thing was if there had been a place where I could
[00:05:15] have gone to play football, but I didn't have to go to school. I'd have been the first one in line
[00:05:20] for that location. Yeah. And as I got closer to, you know, finish school in May of 1966,
[00:05:29] and as they got into September 66, I kind of thought about it. And I said, you know what I might
[00:05:34] do is I might just join the military. Do three years in the army come back home, use the GI
[00:05:41] bill and go to school wherever I wanted to. Because I knew the army would get me a GED just about
[00:05:46] us quick as I got in there. So that was kind of some of my thoughts when I, as they got ready to join
[00:05:52] the military. So what year were you set to graduate from high school? Is that 1967 or no?
[00:05:57] No, 1966. So May of 1966. So may of 1966 you started saying yourself, all right, when I get done,
[00:06:02] I'll just, I'll just join the army. Well, and I don't know if I even really did that. I mean,
[00:06:08] it's, it's probably been more simple than that. I don't know whether I was a forward enough
[00:06:13] thinker to actually be in that direction. I actually drove by the post office in downtown Rochester,
[00:06:20] Minnesota. There's one of those signs that were on a spring in a head uncle Sam, red, white,
[00:06:26] and blue and the big top hat. And his finger was pointed right at the windshield of my car.
[00:06:31] And it said uncle Sam needs you. And I circled the block when in and talk to the army recruiter,
[00:06:38] not really within a great intentions of joining, but just to kind of see what, what that process
[00:06:44] was all about. And what maybe I could do if I did join the army. When that recruiter saw you
[00:06:50] come through the door, he was thinking something completely different. He said, I got this guy.
[00:06:54] Well, yeah, they were probably tremendously in need of warm bodies at that point in time during the
[00:07:00] Vietnam era. So, so this is 1966. So how much were you aware of what was going on in Vietnam?
[00:07:09] At this time, how much were you watching the news? How much were you seeing as far as as far as
[00:07:14] the Vietnam War goes? Because it had definitely escalated by 1966. I mean, I had one of my friends
[00:07:22] who was a pilot in Vietnam, but he was in the Naval Academy. In 1965, they said they didn't even
[00:07:31] talk about Vietnam at the Naval Academy at all. It wasn't until they got close to the end of the
[00:07:37] senior year that they started going, oh, there's a war going on. But by 1966, it had absolutely escalated.
[00:07:43] And so what were your thoughts were you thinking, hey, this is if I go in,
[00:07:48] then I know what's going to happen. I know them to be going to war.
[00:07:50] I mean, there was some discussion with fellow classmates, and I went to a Perlky school,
[00:07:56] and there was a bigger public school that was there in town. And a lot of those guys were talking
[00:08:01] about, let's all go in on the buddy system, whether the Marine Corps, the Army, or something.
[00:08:06] And I didn't want to have anything to do with that. I mean, that was my answer to everybody
[00:08:09] that ever raised that proposition. But we were aware of what was going on and probably she'd pass
[00:08:15] through the living room, your parents had had the television on. You'd see it on the six o'clock
[00:08:20] with the 10 o'clock news. So you knew the respectivity going on, but it wasn't like it didn't
[00:08:25] scare me, but it also wasn't attracted to send me down to the Army recruiters.
[00:08:31] So after that first visit to the Army recruiter after you after Uncle Sam called you out as you drove
[00:08:36] down the street at what point. So you go to see him and how much longer was it before you sign
[00:08:43] the dotted line? Well, I went home and talked to my parents about it and it's kind of one of
[00:08:48] those things where I think they probably really focused on the news much more than I ever did.
[00:08:54] And I mean, the first thing that I mentioned about the possibility during the Army,
[00:08:59] my mother was in tears. I'm sure because of what you see on television. My dad having been
[00:09:04] former member of the military was not quite that way, but just said, hey, you know,
[00:09:09] there's the Navy, there's the Air Force, there's a lot of different possibilities. What
[00:09:13] did she give that some thought? And I just kind of told them if I did join what I thought I
[00:09:19] would want to do and that was to be like a mechanic that was something that I enjoyed doing on
[00:09:25] my own vehicles and motorcycles that we had. So I mean, I never thought about joining to be a combat
[00:09:31] soldier. And again, I probably gave myself about two weeks, had a little bit more discussion with my
[00:09:39] parents and that's probably when I decided to go down and join. Again, I was 18 years old, so it wasn't
[00:09:44] wasn't like I needed permission to join. I could have done it on my own. And that's basically what I did.
[00:09:49] So did you, you were in the cars then? Did you have your own car? I did. Did you have multiple cars?
[00:09:55] At two cars in a motorcycle? And what were they?
[00:09:58] A 1957 Chevy, a 1964 Chevy and a Yamaha 250 motorcycle?
[00:10:04] So you're at your girls that I mentioned girls? You did a little bit, yes.
[00:10:13] And nothing about the Navy, the Marine Corps, did they give you a contract in the Army where you
[00:10:19] were going to become a mechanic? Did they do that back then? They did.
[00:10:23] Okay, so you knew right away, hey, you're going to go in, when to make you a mechanic,
[00:10:28] and that sounds like a pretty good plan. Especially because I'm just thinking like when I
[00:10:33] joined the Navy, all other prospects in life didn't seem as cool as that. They didn't seem,
[00:10:41] you know, when you said you wish there was a place where you could just go and play football,
[00:10:45] well, I wanted a place where I could just go and play a commandil. And there was a place like that.
[00:10:50] It was called the Navy. And that's how I ended up joining. And it seems like, yeah, I don't know,
[00:10:56] I'm not saying I didn't have any other options, but it just seemed like such a good option for me.
[00:11:00] It's so simple and straightforward. And that's actually one of the things that I liked about the
[00:11:04] Navy was when I joined. Nothing else, none of my previous life mattered. It was just here you go.
[00:11:11] Here's what you have to do. So, so, did your mind shift at all about your decision when you
[00:11:18] showed up to boot camp? No, okay. And I think really because, you know, when I reflect on that now
[00:11:25] and look back, that there was a lot of guys who'd never left their home town, never done anything,
[00:11:30] when they got drafted and, and I don't know, what 40% of the people in my basic training,
[00:11:35] and it were probably drafted. Didn't want to be there and never had any intentions of being the military.
[00:11:40] It also scared the living crap out of them. I mean, the people that cried
[00:11:45] half the night all night in basic training, you know, they were away from home for the first time.
[00:11:51] They weren't physical type of people to start with and it was just extremely difficult to watch a
[00:11:56] lot of that while I went through basic training. So, where did you go to basic training?
[00:12:02] Fort Polk Louise and Anna. Now, we're most of the kids that you went through boot camp with.
[00:12:08] Did they send them where they kids that were from that area? Did you go to boot camp
[00:12:12] like regionally or was it people from all over the country? People from all over the country.
[00:12:17] I think you're induction and where you go for basic training in the army at that time,
[00:12:21] dependent on the timing of when you got drafted or when you joined.
[00:12:25] Could have been to Fort Stewart, Georgia. Think there were places out here in California where they
[00:12:30] actually had basic, Fort Lewis Washington had basic all over the place. Fort Dixon, New Jersey.
[00:12:36] So, you're in there with people that have been drafted. You said 40%.
[00:12:40] I think roughly at that time. And there's, I mean, this is where people start doing crazy
[00:12:47] things just to get out, like, you know, wet their bed or whatever sleepwalk and all this kind of
[00:12:52] things so they just would get out of their service. Did you see that kind of thing?
[00:12:56] We had three guys that actually went AWOL and stayed underneath one of those elevated
[00:13:03] wood frame World War II barracks for three days because even if they had got out from
[00:13:08] underneath the barracks, they wouldn't have known how to get out of Louisiana to get back where
[00:13:13] they were from. So people brought them food for three days and then they finally decided to surrender.
[00:13:21] And that's the other the interesting thing about. So this is 1960. This is still 1966.
[00:13:26] And so the anti-war movement wasn't in full swing yet. Was it as far as just
[00:13:33] open hippies in the streets and those kind of things? That wasn't really happening.
[00:13:37] And 66. Was it? No more like 68 and 69 is when it really got cranked up. So these kids that were coming
[00:13:43] in, they were just horrified about what was going to happen. And I don't know whether it was even
[00:13:49] a fear of going to Vietnam. If it was just a fear of being away from home, the physicality of
[00:13:55] of basic training and people screaming and hollering in your face and everything else. I mean,
[00:14:00] I think that's what scared of more than anything else. You know, that's one thing that
[00:14:04] they can never put back in the bottle is these days. Well, first of all, it's all volunteer.
[00:14:10] But second of all, we've seen when I joined the Navy, I had seen, you know, military bootcamp movies
[00:14:17] since I was born. I mean, we just knew every little trick and anticipated everything that was
[00:14:23] going to happen. And it seems like if you were a kid from wherever and you got drafted and you'd
[00:14:31] never left home and then you show up and you got some drill sergeant going nuts at your face.
[00:14:36] Yeah, that's totally different. That's a shock to the system.
[00:14:44] And that was before you could play that card, I guess, that they use now. You know, there's a time
[00:14:49] out card in a lot of different branches of the military where you can go for and make a phone call
[00:14:55] and call your congressman if you want. If you're being mistreated, you can call home and report it.
[00:15:00] Well, they used to say over there, we'll take you to the phone booth, but I'm not sure you'll ever
[00:15:04] make it back to the unit. So, but you were, you were an athlete, you were a three-sport athlete,
[00:15:13] you were used to working and so it wasn't a big deal for you to go through and you
[00:15:20] and you volunteered to do it. Right. So you get done with bootcamp and then what's next, you
[00:15:25] must have to go some kind of MOS school to learn your trade, right? I stayed at Fort Book,
[00:15:29] Louisiana for wheeled vehicle repair school. And that was another, I think, eight weeks or seven weeks.
[00:15:38] And then after that, they decided I was a pretty good mechanic. So they sent me to Fort
[00:15:43] Hill, Oklahoma for track vehicle repair school, which was everything that the Army owned that had a track
[00:15:49] on it, you know, self-propelled howitzers and armored personnel, carers, tanks, you name it, anything
[00:15:55] that had a track on it. Did you enjoy all that? I did. Like I have a nephew that he's just loves
[00:16:04] all kinds of big machinery, you know, he just anything that any caterpillar, any big piece of machinery
[00:16:10] he just loves it. And I could see him joining the Army to be a tank repairman. And then so how long
[00:16:16] is that school last? Another eight weeks. And at this point, are you, I mean, with the war going on,
[00:16:24] are you starting to be more aware of possibilities of where you could end up? Well, you would hear
[00:16:31] people talking about it. And some of the people that I took the track vehicle school with were people
[00:16:36] that had been in the military for a year, year and a half, two years, Robert E. Five, or some of
[00:16:42] them actually even E. Six, who had had the wheel part of it, but never the track part. And I think
[00:16:47] they were kind of merging those two M. O. S. So that's why they were training in both, both categories.
[00:16:53] Did you have any guys in those schools that had already been to Vietnam? We did not, not
[00:16:58] any of those schools, but I did. My first assignment was to the 24th Infantry Division in Germany,
[00:17:03] and there were Vietnam veterans in our unit in Germany. So you wrap up your school and that's your first
[00:17:08] your first permanent duty is over in Germany. And you show up there, which has got to be a good time.
[00:17:17] I mean, it's pretty nice. So are we in the 67 yet? Yep, we're in 67. So 1967, how old are you?
[00:17:25] 19 19 years old, and you get stationed in Weren, Germany?
[00:17:28] Oh, it's good. Did you, did you drink any beer while you were there? A little bit.
[00:17:37] I think everything right outside the gate, just like the military bases here in in this country,
[00:17:41] all the pubs are right outside the gate. And your 19 years old, you got more, you're the richest
[00:17:49] human being in the world, because you got that. What are you to E3?
[00:17:53] $97 a month is what it paid when I joined here. I quit $150 a week job to get $97 a month,
[00:18:01] but I got all the closing free food I wanted. Yeah, I was looking at one of my
[00:18:06] paystubs the other day when I first joined the Navy, and it was, I want to say it was like $700,
[00:18:11] a month or $642 a month, and I was looking at it going dang. They really, they got me pretty good
[00:18:17] in the day for a month. But you're in Germany, and what's your job there? I mean, you're working
[00:18:25] on tracks like you were supposed to. That's what you're doing. Well, I did a little bit of that,
[00:18:29] and what the assignment of do was run the TI-based technical inspection on all the vehicles,
[00:18:34] you know, you know, having been around the military, every vehicle, I step a logbook,
[00:18:38] all the logbooks have to be up to date with repairs and maintenance on them. So my job was to
[00:18:45] sort of fair it out. What needed to be done, making sure the driver took care of it, and if not,
[00:18:49] then we sent the rest over with a work order over to the regular mechanics, and they replaced
[00:18:53] or fixed something that was damaged at that point. Now, are you doing any time in the field at this point?
[00:18:59] We used to go to Graffin, Vera, Holon, Felt's, Wild Fleckin, and do training out that way.
[00:19:04] So you'd go out and do a big exercise, and when you do those exercises, would you be a,
[00:19:11] would you be one of the crew on any of the tracks, or would you be standing by to repair them?
[00:19:16] Only standing by to repair them, because the motor pool was battalion, motor pool, and it was big enough
[00:19:22] that you had the full contingent of mechanics, welders, and everything else. And then how long did you
[00:19:32] spend in Germany? I spent about eight months in Germany before a volunteer to go to Vietnam.
[00:19:39] Now, at this point, you said you did have guys that had been in Vietnam, and they were with you,
[00:19:47] and what were they? What was the feedback they were giving you? Well, I mean, they were negative about it.
[00:19:52] They weren't trying to make it overly scary. I think they were realistic and honest about it.
[00:19:56] But I think one of the things that when I look back at that now, they were okay, and they were alive.
[00:20:03] So, you know, maybe it's really not that bad. Yeah. But I mean, if it had been somebody that had been
[00:20:09] seriously injured, maybe going, maybe I need to think about this a little bit more. Yeah.
[00:20:15] I mean, I was kind of determined to go in the reason that I was, because I felt like when I was
[00:20:21] in Germany, I felt like I had a civilian job with a green uniform. I didn't figure I was being
[00:20:31] utilized or I was using myself to the best of my ability. I joined because I wanted to make some kind of
[00:20:39] a contribution. You know, what, you know, what in a John Wayne kind of story or anything that big?
[00:20:45] But I just didn't feel like I was accomplishing that there in the first surgeon talked to me about
[00:20:51] it and said, you know, you need to think about this. I'm going to give you three or four days.
[00:20:54] Talk to some of the guys that have been in Vietnam. Because I mean, I think he'd been,
[00:20:59] and it wasn't anything you just wanted to rubber stamp and put you on a plane and send you back
[00:21:03] and get you ready to go. He was really a genuine kind of person who felt like, hey,
[00:21:08] make sure this is what you want before we actually sign the paper work and send you on.
[00:21:13] Yeah, there's also different people have different experiences in war. And I know,
[00:21:18] in Iraq, there was places in Iraq where the living conditions were better than most than much of
[00:21:24] the living conditions that I experienced in my normal life in America. And then you go 10 miles away
[00:21:31] or sometimes even three miles from that point and you're outside at some forward operating base.
[00:21:36] And it's really dangerous and really hard living conditions. And it just depends on where you are.
[00:21:41] And I think the other thing you were just talking about, I think they call it survivors bias,
[00:21:46] which is the only people that we get to talk to. Like, it happens with businesses.
[00:21:51] You know, someone says, oh, I did this with my business and that's why I'm a multi-millionaire
[00:21:54] now and says everyone says, well, that must work. So I'll do it. What you don't get to talk to is all the
[00:21:58] people that they tried that and it failed. So yeah, from your perspective, you're here and from
[00:22:02] guys that were in Vietnam. And like you said, they, I don't want to say they had a good time, but it
[00:22:07] wasn't that bad. Because they were coming back to be able to tell you about it. So you thought about it
[00:22:13] for a few days. What were you seeing on the news at this point? You didn't see a much news at all when
[00:22:18] I was in Germany. I mean, I don't know whether I ever watched a television all the while I was there.
[00:22:25] And were there, were there any like Intel reports, were there casualty reports? Were you seeing?
[00:22:33] I got to remember for me and Iraq, I was always paying attention to how many, how many people
[00:22:39] were getting killed every month. I mean, I tracked that all time and you'd see those numbers creeping
[00:22:45] up and they crept up and they crept up and I paid attention to that. Was that something that
[00:22:50] you were looking at thinking, well, hey, that could be me? Never saw any or never heard any reports
[00:22:57] of that at all. I mean, I think there were, there was information shared that people were
[00:23:02] dying in Vietnam, but there wasn't any statistical paperwork that actually would bear out all those
[00:23:09] numbers. So you talked to the first sergeant. He tells you give it a few days. You give it a few
[00:23:15] days and you say, yep, I'm still in. I want to go do this. Did you, when you go volunteer, what do they
[00:23:23] do? Are they assigning you to a specific unit? Are they just shipping you off to Vietnam and you're
[00:23:27] going to sign when you get there? That's what happens. Your replacement troop. So basically, I think
[00:23:33] when Vietnam first got started, whole units went to Vietnam. But as time went on, everybody became
[00:23:40] a replacement troop. Somebody would rotate out tomorrow. Another guy would come in. Three days later,
[00:23:45] another guy would rotate month, you know what I mean? I just went on that way all the while I was in
[00:23:49] country. So how long do they give you to prepare? Did you anything different to prepare? You just
[00:23:56] how long did it take from the time you said, hey, I want to go, yep, and then how long was it before
[00:24:01] you left? It was about two weeks before I actually got orders that came down from Battalion or Brigade.
[00:24:08] Went home on a 30-day leave back to Minnesota during the month of February of 1968. And then
[00:24:14] I reported to Fort Lewis Washington on the last couple days of February, 68 was in country by March
[00:24:23] the first, 68. Did you fly over on civilian aircraft? I did. With studiouss and
[00:24:30] threat of airlines, if I remember correctly, which is not even an existence anymore. What was it called?
[00:24:35] Brand of brand of airlines. And that was, what about saying goodbye to your parents? Was your
[00:24:43] dad nervous with your mom a disaster? She used already sad when you joined the army in the first place.
[00:24:48] It was pretty hard on my mom. And I think it was difficult for my dad to, because I'm sure they
[00:24:55] probably both thought I was just absolutely crazy for volunteering to go. I mean, I could have stayed in
[00:25:00] Germany ran out my three years and got out of the military, but I just couldn't see myself doing that.
[00:25:07] So it was difficult for. So civilian flight, you get over there. You know, again talking about movies
[00:25:17] and we all see the movies and you know, I watched all those Vietnam War movies growing up and
[00:25:23] you, they always have the iconic scenes of the new guys in their fresh camouflage uniforms,
[00:25:32] getting off the bird and there's the hardened veterans that are head and home after year a combat
[00:25:38] and they look like they've been through year combat. Did you, did you see that? I did.
[00:25:44] Yeah, they were actually loading planes on the same location that we were off loading. So just exactly
[00:25:49] like you described is what took place. Anybody talked to you about anything? Anybody say anything to you?
[00:25:56] Um, I mean, usually they're kind of giving you just a thumbs up and they're great big smile on their
[00:26:01] face because they know they're loading the bird and going home. So they're happy to be getting out of
[00:26:06] there. And the attitude with the guys that you were with, you know, you already talked about the
[00:26:10] draftees and boot camp that are freaking out. Was there any guys now that are heading to Vietnam
[00:26:15] and there and some of those guys probably just got out of advancing for chetrini or whatever
[00:26:20] the and have been in the army for whatever for months. Yeah, four months and then maybe a
[00:26:26] 30 day leave at home and on their way to Vietnam. And again, that same kind of situation
[00:26:32] and I think they're whether you join the army or you got drafted. I think they're still that
[00:26:37] fear even though that's what you signed up for if you enlisted. There's that fear of the unknown
[00:26:43] that you've gotten off this plane and what's going to happen next. It's weird because
[00:26:51] there's the I think a lot of this your attitude goes a long way because
[00:26:58] there's definitely people and times and myself included where I would think there's nothing's
[00:27:02] going to happen to me. Like it'll happen to anyone else. I've talked about this before like I always
[00:27:07] feel if I'm on a commercial airline and it blows up in the sky that I'm going to live.
[00:27:13] I'm going to I'm going to grab a seat cushion or something. I'm going to figure it out.
[00:27:18] So there's that kind of stupid ignorance that that I know I had, especially when I was younger,
[00:27:25] like nothing was ever going to happen to me. And I would see that in my guys, you know when I was
[00:27:29] old, I didn't go to war until I was you know older and I saw some of the guys that you could tell
[00:27:34] they didn't think anything was going to happen to them and I had other guys where you would swear
[00:27:40] in their mind they had a target on the back of their head every step that they took. And so you get a
[00:27:47] drastic difference between people's attitudes. Did you see that between did you see that with
[00:27:52] different guys and what did you think yourself? I did see that same thing. I don't think that's
[00:27:57] changed any from Vietnam to the generation that served in Iraq or Afghanistan. I think that
[00:28:04] mixture in that percentage is probably still the same all the time. Certainly a lot of people who
[00:28:11] had a certain Emma West but maybe they had some other kind of a job in the states would say,
[00:28:15] well I might be a Levin Bravo which is a grunt but I'm not going to have to do that because I was
[00:28:21] the company armor and I'll be I'll be running you know distributing weapons and stuff like that
[00:28:26] but you'd see them out in the field some pain later they'd be humpin the bush with the 65 pound
[00:28:31] pack on their back. So I mean I think there was a certain fear but a certain courage is well too
[00:28:38] that I think most of the people that I ever served with displayed and I think even the guys that
[00:28:43] got drafted came to the resolve that you know look at I'm here I met as well make the best of this.
[00:28:50] There's no sense of complaining or whining unless just go ahead and get our year ran get my
[00:28:55] two years in in the military and get it over with and I can go home. So I mean I've always said that
[00:29:00] the people that I served with were tremendously courageous and extremely brave individuals.
[00:29:06] I never saw anything that I would ever be afraid to serve alongside of that person.
[00:29:11] Yeah that's powerful that's the American that's the American serviceman right there
[00:29:16] because even when I was talking about guys that I knew that would and I had friends that would
[00:29:23] verbally you know they'd say I don't know feeling good about tonight man they would say that stuff.
[00:29:29] Yeah and guess what they'd get on their gear and they'd go out night after night and I actually
[00:29:34] have to give them more credit because sometimes I think well I'm not I think I'm going to be fine
[00:29:39] but it doesn't take me that much courage to overcome that and here's a guy that has that feeling
[00:29:45] night after night but like you said every time night after night they're getting their gear on
[00:29:49] they're going out and doing their job. How did you get assigned? So now you show up this is just
[00:29:56] this is like this is what the army has the reputation of the big army hey you're a piece
[00:30:04] you're a piece you're a you're a cog in the machine you give them your I mean how how
[00:30:08] did that process work? Well you get to be an army you do a three day in-country orientation
[00:30:15] where they teach you all about snakes and bamboo vipers and all that crazy stuff and whatnot to
[00:30:20] do and punchy snakes and all that and then I'm sure that while you're there they're working on
[00:30:27] who needs a track vehicle mechanic or who needs infantrymen whichever the case may be and
[00:30:32] they just put me on a plane and flew me up to the night or actually to flew me to Tulae on that one
[00:30:37] and then helicopter and me to Elzie baldie out in the middle of nowhere and that's how I got to the
[00:30:42] unit I served with. Now as you're getting further and further away from civilization did the
[00:30:48] hair on the back of your neck start to stand up straighter? Well I'm probably a little bit on the
[00:30:53] crazy side and I think the curiosity factor I was okay with you know I mean I'm like you're talking
[00:31:00] about I've never felt like I'm not going to say I've never felt fear but I've always just been
[00:31:06] excited about what's going to happen next. I never worried when I was in-country about dying that
[00:31:13] thought never crossed my mind. I just felt like if I did what I knew to do and use the the
[00:31:20] experiences that I had and everything else in a plight of the way you're supposed to I was going to be okay.
[00:31:25] So you're rolling into Elzie baldie? Where about some Vietnam was that? That's in the I-Core area
[00:31:32] closer up to the DMZ. There's about 17 kilometers southwest of Deney. And so is it a pretty remote location
[00:31:39] then? Called the Quasan Valley is our area of operation I mean a lot of the I-Core and that area
[00:31:46] especially in 68 and 69. And how big how big was that was the forward operating base that you were
[00:31:53] staying? How big was it? Not very big I mean battalion headquarters. So it's all in headquarters.
[00:31:58] And then so you check in there you land on your airplane you land on the helicopter. Get out of the
[00:32:05] helicopter and then what happens? Well I go to Eptroops company headquarters report to the first sergeant
[00:32:16] telling who I am and what I am and the first sergeant called everybody's son. He said son. I told him
[00:32:24] I was a track vehicle mechanic and feet point me in the direction the motor pool I'd go report to the
[00:32:29] motor sergeant. He said son. We really don't have a motor pool here in Vietnam. He said there is a guy
[00:32:36] that runs the maintenance department. He's spec 5 so and so. And he said you can you'll see him
[00:32:42] at Chaud a night but you'll be at machine gunner on a 1-1-3-A-1 and we'll make sure you get a toolbox.
[00:32:49] So if anything goes wrong while you're out there that's your job to fix them.
[00:32:52] So there's the wake up call. The uh you know I fought in the battle our body in 2006 and
[00:33:03] you know what vehicle we use for casualty evacuation 113's. Yep the exact same vehicle. So that's
[00:33:11] where you got assigned. You got assigned to a 113 which is an armored personnel carrier made out of
[00:33:17] aluminum if I'm correct. I'm not sure probably wouldn't be bit surprised though and they're very
[00:33:24] they're like they're basically a box with tracks that's basically what they look like exactly.
[00:33:29] It is a box with tracks on them. They're not huge and not as big as a tank. How many people you
[00:33:34] think they hold maybe? You could probably put 80 or 10 on the inside. Yeah we used to are joke about
[00:33:40] armored personnel carriers. What's how many people can you fit into them one more?
[00:33:43] Uh so that's where you get assigned. So now you realize okay there's no motor pool here.
[00:33:51] There's no that's not happening. He says you're gonna be a machine gunner on one of these
[00:33:56] 113's. So you check in who are you checking in with now?
[00:34:01] Are you well when when my unit my platoon was out in the field and they came back in for
[00:34:07] child that night that's when I was introduced to the L.T. and the platoon sergeant and then I don't know
[00:34:14] they just picked a track that was short one guy and that's the one I went to. And how many how many
[00:34:18] tracks do you have in your platoon? Nine. Wow that's a pretty big bulltune. Well it's 18m60
[00:34:24] machine guns nine 50 caliber and one 106 recoilless rifle so it's a lot of fire. Yeah that's that's
[00:34:32] serious business. I didn't think they had that many in one platoon. Then so then okay so now you
[00:34:39] settle in and what kind of what kind of missions were you guys doing? Well hey when I originally
[00:34:45] got in country they called him search and destroy and then I think somebody in Washington decided
[00:34:50] we need to change it to search and clear. It didn't sound quite as disastrous if you called it search
[00:34:56] and clear but the mission was exactly the same thing. You still went out, checked all the villages,
[00:35:01] checked all the people anybody that was out working in the fields looking for cashes or rice,
[00:35:06] looking for weapons that were hidden in different villages, net type of thing. Sometimes you'd have
[00:35:11] intelligence reports that would send you somewhere or maybe they had some information that there was
[00:35:16] something bad going on. Sometimes it was there sometimes it wasn't. The area of operation that I actually
[00:35:23] worked in was exactly the same one. Me lie was in my area of operation. We called it the pink
[00:35:30] bill on our map and I think Lieutenant Kelly's thing had happened three weeks or four weeks after I
[00:35:38] got in country or something like in third week and March or maybe around the first of April you
[00:35:44] you're familiar with that. But you guys did you guys hear anything about it?
[00:35:51] I think we heard a little bit about it but communication back then was not the same as it is today.
[00:35:58] I mean obviously nobody had cell phones or anything like that. You didn't have pictures or any
[00:36:03] information. We just knew there was a lot of people in that village and it was a sizeable village
[00:36:09] for as remote as it was. Most of them were just all rice farmers that were out there so all they
[00:36:14] do was harvest rice and carry it to market. But we'd been through there a number of different times
[00:36:19] before and after the actual meal I massacre. And I think the thing that was interesting about
[00:36:26] Vietnam was for villagers. If I used an interpreter to ask somebody a question in a village
[00:36:31] about what they rather have the NVA in charge or where they rather have the Americans or the
[00:36:36] South Vietnamese military in charge and they were really always reluctant to answer that question
[00:36:43] because I don't think there was a good answer they could give me. If they answered at one
[00:36:50] way it kind of meant they were Vietnamese NVA sympathizers and if the injured at the other way
[00:36:57] then that meant they were totally opposed and they would support us but we know that wasn't the
[00:37:01] way it happened either. They were just trying to go rice and stay alive. So I mean if we would leave
[00:37:06] them alone and the NVA would leave them alone they'd be the happiest people on the face of the earth
[00:37:10] but it didn't happen that way. We didn't abuse them but the NVA abused them all the time not only
[00:37:16] for the rice but for shelter and everything else. How what was your opt-empo like and so how long
[00:37:24] would you go out on a mission for? I mean probably a standard time is about 20 to 22 days at a time
[00:37:31] and then we get re-supplied in the field with shinux for fuel and for water and food and everything.
[00:37:37] So this forward operating base that you were out that you were out of when that
[00:37:42] potteen came back they'd been out for a long time they'd been out for and on that particular
[00:37:47] one I don't know but I would have to guess they probably were at least a two week period of time
[00:37:51] once you went out and you started through the area of operation usually didn't come back until
[00:37:56] you covered the whole thing. But you guys are living do you have death mounts with you or is
[00:38:02] everyone on is everyone in the potoon traveling inside the track and sleeping inside the track
[00:38:09] and you got water I mean what's like the daily routine like? Well you get up and fix breakfast
[00:38:16] you know fix some coffee or some sea rations and you know easy to carry it because your armored
[00:38:23] personnel carriers wait didn't make a lot of different stuff we'd have somebody would fix this
[00:38:29] somebody would fix the coffee we'd all kind of share the meal together because you didn't have any
[00:38:33] food that came out to the field very often and we just sit down maybe the night before that
[00:38:40] morning with the L.T. and go over what the daily operation was and follow up with a myler
[00:38:45] cover on the map sheet and a grease pencil and you know go through the checkpoints throughout the
[00:38:50] course of the day you know if you faced any any difficulties you you know just faced it had on return
[00:38:57] fire called in artillery maybe you'd get a call an infantry unit to be pinned down nice
[00:39:03] part of about being armored personnel carriers you could move real fast lay down a lot of
[00:39:08] suppressing fire and let them back out and save them we did that from Marines as well as
[00:39:13] United States Army so then um and then this is just what you do this is just the day in
[00:39:22] day out all day every day and you're during the night time you you stay you know you stay on
[00:39:27] watch but you're in a perimeter somehow and circle up just like wagon trains and an old
[00:39:31] western television program like John Wayne in the guys and and then everybody would stay up on
[00:39:39] the track there'd be two hours segments from 10 to midnight on down to 6 o'clock in the morning
[00:39:44] you'd rotate every two hours and you just be you know you'd have clay mors out and set up your
[00:39:49] perimeter defense and everything you'd call in dead cons so that you had positions available for
[00:39:55] local artillery could drop stuff real quick if you needed to have it now it seems like it would
[00:40:00] not be a great move for the the conner for the NVA to attack you know this you guys I mean
[00:40:11] how how often did they attack never well I was there but I think the the big thing is
[00:40:17] is is that one of the things you have going for you is you have the speed of movement
[00:40:23] that you could travel with an armored personnel carrier so there really wasn't any way that
[00:40:27] they could pattern you and go set up in front of you or follow you fast enough to be even if they
[00:40:36] probably walk through the night to get you which might have been possible but it never happened
[00:40:41] I just don't think they ever tried to do that when they had enough infantry units and Marines
[00:40:46] that were in the area and they were walking slower and their movement was slower that's who they
[00:40:51] would set up on and then you guys would utilize your firepower to go help out if some infantry unit
[00:40:58] called for help you guys were rolling and and laid down the thunder which you guys most certainly
[00:41:04] had that weapons package is no is no joke right there wow wow well when you talked about it before
[00:41:10] when we rode two machine gunners the hatch was always open on an APC and two machine gunners said
[00:41:17] on on the back on that hatch with the guns out to the right and left of course the the turret
[00:41:24] was in the center with a 50 caliber and you never got down inside I mean it only if maybe if you were
[00:41:31] taking fire you'd get down and get behind the the the M60 but you stayed up on top all the time
[00:41:38] because I guess if you were ever going to hit a land mine which is you know something that happened
[00:41:42] quite often you didn't want to be down inside with stuff exploding from from that explosion
[00:41:48] you wanted to be on the top and maybe get blown clear but so that was out was at the biggest
[00:41:53] threat to the tracks was getting hit in some kind of land mine or an RPG rocket from a woodland
[00:42:00] the yeah I mean obviously in Iraq and Afghanistan really I mean I can really only talk about
[00:42:07] Iraq from my experience but yeah the obviously the roadside bombs were what what they what they did
[00:42:14] that was what they did and they did it well and you know the the bigger vehicles that we got
[00:42:20] the bigger bombs they built and so when it started my first deployment we were in humvies with
[00:42:26] we didn't have we literally didn't have doors on our humvies we actually turned the seats
[00:42:31] to face outboard so that we could present our weapon and that we could present our front
[00:42:35] plate of our of our body armor and then eventually we put we welded doors together and put
[00:42:42] steel doors on and then by the time I got back to Iraq we had armored humvies and then
[00:42:46] after that came the big giant of mine resistant vehicles and the whole time the enemy just kept
[00:42:52] building bigger and bigger and bigger bombs but we were always we were oftentimes not always but
[00:42:59] we were oftentimes channelized on roads because of bridges or because of because of just being
[00:43:05] in the city whereas you guys did you guys you guys with tracks in the jungle or you know you guys
[00:43:13] could just go wherever you want to do is that right pretty much so the biggest thing that we had to
[00:43:18] do and I mean that was the number one thing in part of the training with you drove where you were
[00:43:22] commanding a track was you never take the same stream crossing twice you you track the vehicle
[00:43:29] right directly in front of you you never get outside of the lead tracks tracks in the ground and we'd
[00:43:35] stay in the patties or around the patties as much as possible because it weren't very likely
[00:43:41] to put a landmine in the rice patties it would be on the road or the edge of the road or maybe
[00:43:46] on a rice petty pike that we never never went in that direction very often either and what was your
[00:43:52] leadership like you know your your young lieutenant platoon commander what was he like what was your
[00:43:58] platoon sergeant like what did what was your interaction with those guys like and even your vehicle
[00:44:03] so who was in charge of of your track was he was a young E5 probably 21 or 22 years old at that time
[00:44:12] and the leadership in my platoon the platoon leader was was a great first lieutenant and I mean it was
[00:44:19] one of those things that I learned very early on the best thing that I could do for the first three
[00:44:23] or four months was just shut up and listen and watch what was going on and follow the lead of the
[00:44:29] people that really knew what was going on the platoon sergeant was that same kind of a person
[00:44:35] the different with the platoon sergeant was that he was probably in his 30s he was married he had
[00:44:41] children back home so I don't think it was as easy for him to be a strong leader and a strong
[00:44:49] decision maker because I think that was on his mind a lot the L.T. was not that way and everybody
[00:44:58] that we served with was not that way I don't know if I know anybody else that I served with
[00:45:05] for 10 and a half months that was married other than most of the platoon sergeants or the first
[00:45:11] sergeant so they have that in the back of their mind they're thinking about you can sense that
[00:45:16] there may be leaning a little bit towards trying to stay alive and trying to take less risk and
[00:45:23] you know to all that works is that's not always the best person to have for a leader if you're not
[00:45:30] tuned in 24-7 while you're there you're in trouble you know that's the only way to survive you
[00:45:38] have to be conscious of every fly that lands on on your food you know what I mean you're just you just
[00:45:45] get that heightened sense of awareness that it's probably lucky you can even go to sleep when you
[00:45:50] lay down at night because you're the adrenaline is pumps so much all day long yeah something else
[00:45:56] that I always felt and I don't know from right or wrong but I always felt that if you were thinking
[00:46:04] about other things like family that was going to make you less aggressive and as far as I can tell
[00:46:12] if you're aggression if you're not aggressive on the battlefield that has a higher probability
[00:46:20] of getting you killed than if you're aggressive I think that hesitation is a bad thing and
[00:46:28] I'm looking at saying and I used to try and make this clear all the time and I'm talking about
[00:46:31] you know being hyper aggressive and running to your death that's not what I'm talking about but
[00:46:35] if there's something going on and you're nervous about making a move that's not a good thing
[00:46:41] to have happening and it would make when I would have guys that I could see you were
[00:46:47] thinking about other things it would make me nervous that they were going to hesitate when they
[00:46:52] needed to move or needed to make something happen. I agree a hundred percent because we experience
[00:46:59] a lot of that and the only thing I would do when I got to a position where it was an E5 or eventually
[00:47:04] became an E6 was to identify those people and try to utilize them in some spot where they weren't
[00:47:12] going to get anybody else killed. That wasn't always real easy to do short of actually sending
[00:47:17] him back to the rear area and not let him come out and out in the field with us but if you were
[00:47:22] short of people you didn't have that option very often either so you were an E4 when you got in
[00:47:28] country and then you got promoted to E5 right did that change your position in the in the track
[00:47:36] at all it took me off the machine gun and put me behind the 50. That's good did you
[00:47:45] and then did you eventually make E6 I did and did that change your position again at some point
[00:47:50] did you become like the vehicle commander I became what was called the field for a surge with the
[00:47:55] called six alpha in the in the army I was on the command track out in the field with the company
[00:48:01] commander and then two other machine gunners on our track so you did you leave your
[00:48:07] platoon to go and be with the company commander I did and what's your what's your job when you're
[00:48:13] in that position well basically everything you do for the daily operation you're kind of in charge
[00:48:20] over overseeing everything you're you know because keep in mind now we've got not just my third
[00:48:25] platoon out there but the second and the first might be with us or they might be off on an operation
[00:48:31] of their own sometimes two platoons that go out together and we wanted to go a different
[00:48:35] direction so you had to be cognizant of where everybody was all the time and what they were doing
[00:48:41] and any difficulties that they were having and it was a brand new company commander who did not
[00:48:46] have any Vietnam experience so then it was almost like having to train the CO once he got there so
[00:48:55] I think the fact that I got assigned to that track was what the first sergeant felt enough confidence in
[00:49:00] me that I could do that and not be a jerk to him or not worry about him being a captain versus me being
[00:49:08] any six I mean that part never bothered me anyway you know man never picked much attention to that
[00:49:15] so how long had you been in Vietnam when you got moved to that assignment? I had been in country
[00:49:23] about eight and a half months so that was that's like perfect then you got a you know year
[00:49:29] experience and the the company commander didn't have any experience I know I always had a
[00:49:35] I had a special vehicle we in a Humvee the vehicle commander sits in the in the basically the front
[00:49:43] right passenger seat and you know you're the one that's supposed to be kind of directing the vehicle and
[00:49:47] and I would always have to do other things because I was either an assault force commander,
[00:49:51] a ground force commander, whatever so I always had I always took the best smartest driver so that I didn't
[00:49:58] have to do worry about him you know and it's kind of the same relationship you know he knew that
[00:50:04] hey he needed to handle all the stuff going on with the vehicle but that's um that's like the way the
[00:50:09] military does things the military does things like that right there where they take the the new
[00:50:14] company commander that doesn't have any experience and they give him a guy that can help
[00:50:20] advise him in a you know positive way to make sure he doesn't for lack of a better word
[00:50:26] screw anything up. I thought it was a very enjoyable process because I mean I didn't intend to be a
[00:50:35] career soldier so I mean I just knew that I had X number of time amount of time days months whatever it
[00:50:44] was but I've just always felt like if I'm gonna do something I'm gonna do it to the best of my ability.
[00:50:51] I'm sure I didn't have all the answers but I also knew who to to talk to who'd still been around
[00:50:57] even longer than I had some guys who had extended been there 14 15 months already you know and
[00:51:04] a great deal more experience than I did I would ask I'm not afraid to get information from somebody. I mean that's
[00:51:11] that's that knowledge could save a lot of people's lives and that's a big part of what I felt like
[00:51:16] I was responsible for now I'm responsible for the whole company which is you know I don't know
[00:51:22] 210 people I guess at that point. Now you mentioned that the the the the enemy was not outright openly
[00:51:30] attacking you but you guys were responding what was the casualty rate for F troop while you were there.
[00:51:43] I mean just in terms of how often were you guys taking casualties and I know I looked there's
[00:51:50] a really good website that you guys have from F troop and Vietnam and it in why the numbers are
[00:51:57] down in 1967 so before you showed up there was there was four people from from F troop that were
[00:52:06] killed in action in 1968 so the year that you were there that number went up five times
[00:52:14] these were and according to that document it said that there was 20 20 men killed in action in
[00:52:22] 1968 so that is some heavy contact I mean that's more than 10 percent that's more than 10 percent
[00:52:30] that's not that's not counting wounded in action that's all killed in action so even though you said
[00:52:35] the enemy wasn't attacking you very often you guys must have been in some significant enemy
[00:52:40] contacts to be taken those those kind of casualties. Well and I think most of those that I'm familiar
[00:52:46] with were all landmines and they were landmines for people on the vehicles were at blue the M1-1-3
[00:52:53] to pieces. I mean the reason we had a new company commander in the fall of 68 was because the
[00:53:01] company commander had directed a new driver to do a stream crossing that we knew you shouldn't
[00:53:07] cross a second or third time and it blew they hit a 500 pounder and I mean it just killed all
[00:53:13] four people on the track and it blew the the captain off he was riding on the driver's hatch
[00:53:19] that was open blew him clear but injured him seriously that's why we ended up with a new company
[00:53:24] commander and then Jim Stark he was from San Jose, California was a real good friend of mine
[00:53:30] was killed in April of 1968 shortly after you know like six weeks after I got in country but
[00:53:37] he was just one of those guys that love girls and played sports so immediately became a
[00:53:43] great friend. That's one of the horrible things about the one one three and it's really the same
[00:53:50] thing with a humvee they built those things to have a low profile because when you're talking
[00:53:56] about tank battles what you want to have is you want to have a low profile so that you can hide
[00:54:01] behind you can take the vehicle and you can you can sink it into a depression you can get behind
[00:54:06] some kind of a terrain feature and not get shot at. The problem with designing vehicles with
[00:54:12] an extremely low profile is that they have no ground clearance and so when there's a landmine
[00:54:20] underneath them it just it just just wrecks those vehicles and that's why the new vehicles the
[00:54:27] mine resistant vehicles their super tall off the ground they have these big V shaped holes that literally
[00:54:33] deflects some of the power of the bombs at the enemy plants so that's one of the problems with
[00:54:40] these one one three is there's not much ground clearance on them and so when they get hit with a
[00:54:45] with a mine it does catastrophic damage often and so that was what you you guys that was the major
[00:54:54] threat from the enemy was was hitting these these bombs. Yeah and I would have to guess I mean I
[00:54:59] had never heard that number before that we lost 28 in 1968 but I would have to guess it may be two
[00:55:05] or three of those might have been small arms fire and the rest were all from their vehicles being
[00:55:10] blowing up. How did that grade on your nerves? The the landmine explosions? Yeah. Well again you still
[00:55:23] just do everything to the best of your ability you have to track that vehicle in front of you.
[00:55:29] Now obviously if you're the lead track and that changes periodically but you're in greater
[00:55:36] jeopardy that you could hit something because there's no way in the world that you can't
[00:55:41] hang a wound and do you know mind detectors and stuff you're out the middle of nowhere you
[00:55:45] probably get shot off the track trying to run detectors and you would just run through it but
[00:55:50] in most of ours were not that kind of explosion they were more bad choices by people who thought
[00:56:00] this time it's going to be okay and you just can't do things that way it's never going to be
[00:56:07] okay it's always going to be bad and if you think that direction you'll usually be safe 90
[00:56:14] percent of the time and like I say when the captain made that decision my best friend from
[00:56:20] Marks that she texted Chris Wendler was his driver and Chris would have never
[00:56:26] crossed that stream as his driver but he had a replacement because Chris was back home in
[00:56:32] Texas on a 30 day extension leave and I mean I've asked Chris that question over all the years
[00:56:40] of you know would you have crossed it he said but captain Davis probably would have listened to me
[00:56:45] but he probably wouldn't listen to anybody else because Chris had a great deal of experience driving
[00:56:51] for it that's one of the misconceptions about the military and it's really one of the
[00:56:55] misconceptions about leadership is is the last thing that I want as a leader is to have a bunch
[00:57:04] of yes men that are just going to do what I tell them to do because I told them to do it I want
[00:57:09] people that are going to say hey Jock I don't know if that's the best idea or hey that we should
[00:57:13] do this a different way and and people don't think that that's going to happen in the military
[00:57:17] that's what you want you want that kind of environment inside the military and the good thing
[00:57:22] is that way when I would make a call and guys would execute I knew it was a good call because
[00:57:26] no one gave me any pushback because believe me I had a relationship with my guys if I was saying
[00:57:30] tell them to do something stupid they'd say hey boss we need to we need to put go go on hold
[00:57:35] right now and figure this out there's got to be a better way so that's the way that that's how
[00:57:41] I that's how I make good decisions not because I'm great it's because I got a bunch of great
[00:57:44] guys working for me that are going to tell me hey that's not the right call and that's a classic
[00:57:48] example right there you know if if Chris who had the experience and had the the the the the where
[00:57:55] we're fall to say hey boss we don't want to cross right there it's not a good call let's just go
[00:57:59] 10 meters down mix it up a little bit that's the kind of thing where that that would save lives
[00:58:06] and the other thing that you just talked about this is another thing that people get really surprised
[00:58:10] about is even because we work I work with a lot of companies and businesses and people say well you
[00:58:17] know my guys get complacent with things because you know there's there's it's not combat so people
[00:58:25] get complacent I always have to explain people get complacent in combat too you go on you go on
[00:58:32] your 14th patrol on a row in a row and nothing's happened for the last 13 patrols and you think
[00:58:39] oh you know we can we can cross here or we don't need to we need to pack extra ammo or I don't
[00:58:45] need to carry that extra radio battery because I have a needed yet and we cut those corners when you
[00:58:50] get complacent that's when these horrible things happen you cannot get complacent and all those
[00:58:58] all those service men out there right now service men and women don't cut corners don't do it you
[00:59:04] got to hold the line and if you see people cutting corners call them out one of the biggest
[00:59:10] things that some of the infantry units used to do is get complacent and not put claim wars out
[00:59:16] when they set up for the night and just like you mentioned it might have worked 12 or 13 times before
[00:59:21] but the one time you decide you're going to leave it in your pack that's exactly when Charlie
[00:59:27] decides to come through the perimeter not that he knew but you weren't prepared you know that's
[00:59:32] that's the guaranteed way to get attacked don't set up claim wars every time you set up claim
[00:59:38] wars in your prepared and everyone standard watch correctly that's how you don't get attacked
[00:59:42] the minute that someone slacks off yeah that's that's what that's what sent you going sideways now
[00:59:48] you mentioned the draftees that pretty much when you were there once you guys were in country once
[00:59:54] you were doing your job did you could you even tell the difference between who's a draftee
[00:59:59] and who wasn't only if you would ask him if that was the case because there was no other
[01:00:03] identification anybody but you know again I say this because in ten and a half months period of
[01:00:09] time they were still the most courageous and brave people that I've ever served with I think they
[01:00:14] resolved all that draft stuff and I don't want to be here before they got in country or right
[01:00:20] after they got in country because they were they were not complacent at all once once I started
[01:00:25] to work with them yeah I had a retired general who is who is what a David hackworth's
[01:00:35] company commanders and Vietnam and I asked him about the draftees and he said he couldn't tell
[01:00:40] who is a draftee and who wasn't and and I always you know I hear a lot of people ask me about
[01:00:46] again the skating into the business world people ask me about what it's like to or you know how
[01:00:50] how do you handle these millennials and I always bring up people like hackworth who says
[01:00:58] who hackworth said he loved his draftees I mean I don't think you need a harger workforce
[01:01:02] to deal with and someone that was drafted to Vietnam that doesn't believe in the war that doesn't
[01:01:07] want to be there and who can lose their life doing this job okay I get it the millennial might
[01:01:12] like looking at his phone or whatever but that's still as a completely different deal but if you have
[01:01:16] good leadership and you explain to them why it's important and you get them involved and give
[01:01:22] them ownership they'll step up and you're the you're another example of someone looking at me
[01:01:28] and saying hey the draftees if they knew it was going on we couldn't tell who is who and that's
[01:01:35] again a testament not only to good leadership but it's a testament to to American soldier and what
[01:01:41] we do here when you you you said you got shifted into that new job with the company commander
[01:01:51] at eight and a half months at are you starting you know and we said this a little bit
[01:01:58] not as much as you guys not as much as I hear about it in Vietnam but we might have had this creep into
[01:02:03] our head a little bit of the idea of you know you got short time and it's almost time to go home
[01:02:09] and and did that start creeping into your mind at all at eight and a half months there was that
[01:02:15] too far away where you're not even thinking about it yet I honestly never gave it any thought at all
[01:02:20] I mean I knew when my rotation date was but a lot of guys actually made what was called a short time
[01:02:25] calendar that's a bad idea never never never did that at all so you just every day was a new day
[01:02:32] you're going to do your best job and if you're doing what you're doing that's the best you can do
[01:02:37] and that's one more thing I wanted to say this because again we got young folks in the military out there
[01:02:44] when I was talking about hey some people are afraid some people are in a afraid some people think it's
[01:02:49] gonna happen them some people think it'll never happen them look wherever you are on that spectrum
[01:02:54] what what I can say is this there's things that you can control there's things that you can't control
[01:03:01] and as you're going into combat before you're going to combat train hard be prepared
[01:03:07] know your weapon systems know your immediate action drills then that's that's the best you can do
[01:03:12] you've done everything you can to take control over what you can control once you're in combat there's
[01:03:18] some things that you're not going to be able to control and if you worry about those things it's
[01:03:23] actually a set it actually negatively impact you if you're worried about things that you can't
[01:03:30] control if you're worried about what's going on at home if you're worried about mate all those things
[01:03:33] they're gonna take away your aggressiveness take take away your awareness take away your attention
[01:03:38] those things are gonna drag you in the wrong direction so don't worry about the things that you
[01:03:43] can't control it's okay to be afraid too like hey if you're if you're scared guess what it's normal
[01:03:49] you're going into a hard situation it's normal you're gonna be you're gonna feel that you're going to
[01:03:54] feel your gut's gonna feel uh what do they say butterflies in your stomach that's normal it's okay
[01:03:59] it's no big deal that's what people feel it's you don't need to think your your weak because you're
[01:04:05] feeling that you're just going into survival mode you got butterflies in your stomach because
[01:04:10] your blood's drawn away from there because you want to focus on other things it's a positive thing
[01:04:14] so don't worry about those things you can't control focus on what you can control and if you're
[01:04:19] if you're feeling a little bit afraid good that means your your mind isn't the right place you're
[01:04:24] aware and you're in a hyper sensory mode so you can survive out on the battlefield that's what's going on
[01:04:32] um what was the what was going on with the mission where you got wounded
[01:04:42] we've been out on a searching clear for that whole day I mean probably it'd been out in the field
[01:04:48] for six or seven days at that point I had picked the night longer position we set up that evening
[01:04:55] about five to six o'clock we were supposed to get resupply and get get hotchow that night brought
[01:05:00] up by helicopter and so what I was doing was once the platoon's got set up on the perimeter
[01:05:07] and our command track was in the center of the circle I went out to check the um clay morson
[01:05:13] all the perimeter defense to make sure that everybody put out what I mean because I just did that
[01:05:18] before I don't know whether that was my responsibility as in my new position but I probably
[01:05:24] slept much better knowing that I had checked it and that's when I stepped on a landmine was
[01:05:29] checking the perimeter and what do you remember about stepping on a landmine? I don't remember it
[01:05:35] blowing I remember going up in the air and I remember coming back down I never lost consciousness
[01:05:41] um you know from the from the explosion but when I laid on my back and the medic came over and I
[01:05:47] known the medic for seven or eight months and and tears were running down his face and he was
[01:05:52] telling me I was going to be okay I knew it wasn't real good. Not what you want to hear from the
[01:05:58] medic on it at what point so that was so then what happens? You're well I mean I I laid there
[01:06:04] for a little bit while he's trying to do stuff the interesting thing that happened with my
[01:06:08] my explosion was all powder there was no shrapnel to it whatsoever must just been a bag of
[01:06:14] H.E. you know so when it blew it actually blew in a gigantic ball of flame and it partially
[01:06:21] caught a rise my arteries that were exposed and probably actually saved my life at the same time
[01:06:26] the dampy tated both of my legs and my arm because I didn't lose consciousness and he wasn't
[01:06:32] forced to do turn against and all kinds of other stuff to try to save me so you know whatever time
[01:06:37] I spent on the ground then dust off helicopter and about a 12 minute ride to the 95th of the
[01:06:42] back and that's kind of the way that one worked. He didn't even put turnic hits on you.
[01:06:46] Didn't have to do so you lost both legs you lost your arm you didn't put turnic hits on anything.
[01:06:51] Right that's crazy. Is it burn shut? Wow. Yeah.
[01:06:56] Hey do you we burned anywhere else on your body? Some you know done my chest and under this
[01:07:01] arm because most of the blast came up the left hand side that's what saved my right arm I guess.
[01:07:07] Did you where were you wearing a flat jacket? No. Did you how often were you guys wearing flat jackets?
[01:07:12] When you were on the track and rolling but just don't walk around generally didn't you know you
[01:07:17] wouldn't even you'd roll up your pant legs because it was so hot you'd just wear a t-shirt
[01:07:23] and carry your weapon. So 12 minute flight and where did they take you?
[01:07:29] The 95th of the back and the knee back hospital and were you still conscious at this point?
[01:07:34] No, I lost consciousness on the flight because I knew I went into shock as I felt like I was
[01:07:38] going to freeze to death soon as the chopper lifted off and then I remember maybe a little bit of
[01:07:45] consciousness when I first got to the 95th of the back don't know exactly what they did there but
[01:07:50] it was a real slow night so it wasn't like there was a lot of casualties and they didn't have
[01:07:54] to triage you never know how that might work out either if they have to pick and choose who they're
[01:07:58] going to work on so they just took me right in and you know got me right up on the table to
[01:08:03] begin with and went to work. Did you know did you know while you were conscious that you lost
[01:08:07] your legs and your arm? The only thing I remember when I was laying on my back out in the field after
[01:08:13] the explosion was I reached down with my good arm and I could touch this stump as long enough that
[01:08:20] if I'm laying on my back I can probably touch it but not all the way to the end so I felt like I
[01:08:25] still had this leg. I couldn't reach the other side I didn't know how badly damaged all of this
[01:08:30] was didn't know that till I actually got to Japan quite some time after you know the evac
[01:08:37] hospital and a bunch of surgeries in Japan so when they when you so when you lose conscious they put
[01:08:43] you in a medically induced coma. They didn't do that when I was at the 95th of back in
[01:08:49] denang but they did it shortly after I got to the 106 general in Yokohama Japan and I was unconscious
[01:08:56] from the 14th of January of 69 to the 15th of February of 69 31 days 31 days that's a medically
[01:09:06] induced coma and then you wake up and you're in Japan and what kind of a shock was that when you
[01:09:14] woke up? Well I mean I really didn't know for sure exactly where I was when I woke up but you
[01:09:20] know I mean it doesn't take you too long to figure out because the nurses are all coming around
[01:09:24] and they would actually straight up ask you do you know where you are you know so if you didn't they tell
[01:09:29] you and you know that was more for me to spend five weeks there was highly unusual. Normally
[01:09:39] all you did was come through the 106 or campzam in Japan for the army and they'd stabilize
[01:09:45] make sure you're going to be strong enough to make the trip back across specific to get to
[01:09:50] back to the states and I think they just once they got started with me and on any surgeries I think
[01:09:56] somebody just made a decision let's just do all of them right here let's not worry about waiting
[01:10:02] while we've got him in the position that we have him and let's just keep him there and go in
[01:10:05] and not a surgery so I mean I'm actually probably pretty fortunate that they did and then you know
[01:10:11] like a week after I came out of the coma they tried to feed you regular food but I'll guarantee
[01:10:17] that when you have an eaten for five weeks nothing looks real good it doesn't taste very good either so
[01:10:23] but I did regain enough strength to make the trip back across specific went to landed in
[01:10:30] California at Travis Air Force Base in California and spent the night and then went on to
[01:10:37] fit Simmons General Hospital in a Rara Colorado. It's right did the rest of my rehab for another nine
[01:10:43] months so when you when you figure out that you know you lost both your legs you lost your arm
[01:10:48] what what are you thinking at this point? I mean there's a lot of stuff when I when I got back
[01:10:54] to the states I actually got sick whether an airborne thing or whatever it was and I mean I was
[01:11:00] to the point where not only could I not eat whole food but I couldn't even really drink
[01:11:05] hardly any liquid it wouldn't stay down either so they kind of estimate I went from 220 pounds
[01:11:11] before the explosion to about 150 after the explosion and then from the time they put me on the
[01:11:18] plane in Japan and suddenly back to the states they figure out probably weighed about 135 pounds
[01:11:24] and then after I got sick at fits Simmons until like you know actually started being able to eat again
[01:11:29] I waited about 95 or 98 pounds so I think did they share some photos with you? I did I saw something
[01:11:38] and that that one is kind of a scary I mean it's kind of a Auschwitz like looking photograph
[01:11:45] I guess is the way I describe it right? Yeah and when you were going through that are you thinking
[01:11:53] I mean is it is it that you can't hold your food down is it that your you don't have an appetite
[01:12:01] I think you're probably a combination of a lot of things but they think I had some sort of
[01:12:09] virus or something that you know because I'd really only been back to the states for 30 days
[01:12:16] and almost a two-year period of time something that I picked up some or could have even been in the
[01:12:21] hospital in Japan because I mean I ate food for a week in Japan before I got on the flight back to
[01:12:27] the states and when I got back to fits Simmons I would just sick I mean I couldn't horrible sick
[01:12:33] enough to lose like 40 more pounds and that's that's that's crazy now did you get like the
[01:12:40] Phantom pain and your limbs and stuff for the first five years it's really pretty bad I mean it
[01:12:48] because it's like you still feel like you have those limbs like you feel like you need to scratch
[01:12:52] behind your knee or scratch you know your hand is itching that type of thing it's almost like you're
[01:12:58] bald up in a fist where your fingernails are pushed into your hand type of thing and little by
[01:13:03] little I think is those nerve endings received from the surgery and the amputations a lot of that
[01:13:09] relaxes and changes I don't get that at all anymore but I mean it's been 50 years now so
[01:13:15] so when you get to the fits Simmons Army Medical Center to start your rehab I mean at this point
[01:13:24] then it must have been not too many guys that were in worship than you are at 90 pounds and sick
[01:13:32] and missing three limbs I mean you must have been in comparatively and the reason I say that is because
[01:13:38] you know with the moderate advances with combat trauma and how quickly we can matter
[01:13:42] back guys off the battlefield and we get guys that are in horrible suffering horrible wounds but they're
[01:13:48] able to survive because the medical advancement that we have but for you it was like a miracle
[01:13:54] through the the type of blast I mean because if that would have been any other type of blast the chances
[01:14:00] of you being alive are very slim so when you got there I'm like what would the other guys think it
[01:14:07] mean I mean there was two other triple amputees that were already at fits Simmons at the time
[01:14:13] the orthopedic words were full of single leg and double leg amputations because I mean that's exactly
[01:14:20] what they're placing via now I'm all the time not much different than a rack and Afghanistan
[01:14:25] we're watching a lot of young guys come back with multiple amputations so I mean I think you
[01:14:31] you cared for one another is where you got your support I mean the hospital staff did everything
[01:14:37] they possibly could they were incredible doctors nurses you know aids whatever it was
[01:14:44] but actually another triple amputee was more beneficial to my survival someone who'd been there
[01:14:49] for two months three months or four months before I got hurt you know and then you could at least
[01:14:54] you could emulate and say you look at this guy can make it I can make it I'm not sure what I'm
[01:14:59] going to do with the rest of my life but I think I'm going to be okay I'm going to be alive
[01:15:04] and then how long how long was that rehab at fits Simmons that was nine months total
[01:15:10] because I got discharge from the military on the 22nd of November 1969 and that's occupational therapy
[01:15:18] working with a prosthetic arm making sure that you can use it and function with it I had prosthetic legs
[01:15:25] walked in the parallel bars but but not a it's not anything you're going to use the rest of your
[01:15:31] life and even if you fast forward today's modern limbs with computers and everything else
[01:15:37] it still wouldn't work for a triple amputee in in my condition and you wouldn't be able to function
[01:15:45] the same way that I do today to be able to get out and go and do things and be aggressive
[01:15:50] if you had to worry about trying to put those things on deal with them all day long worry about
[01:15:56] falling somewhere not being able to get back up so I mean it was a real easy decision for me and
[01:16:02] like October early November 69 that we'll just put those in a trunk someplace and have great
[01:16:08] memories about walking in the parallel bars so you were done with rehab at nine months
[01:16:14] well really once you heal and if you're not going to do anything further with prosthetic legs
[01:16:21] and they need a bed because you're still killing and injuring a lot of people in Vietnam in November
[01:16:26] 1969 you know you got to move on something's got to happen so 1969 this is this is at the height
[01:16:35] of like anti-war protests and woodstock was in woodstock was in August of 1969 are you paying
[01:16:45] attention to that is that entering your world at all or we're we're watching it on the
[01:16:49] ward in the day room and probably just getting a tremendous amount of enjoyment out of it because
[01:16:54] we're all sitting around we're all Vietnam combat soldiers you know on the ward so you know
[01:17:00] you know I think some people actually talk but maybe we should go to woodstock I don't think anybody did though
[01:17:07] but did you feel like like I know that our treatment from the wars from the wars that we've been
[01:17:14] in the last couple decades you know we've had great treatment from for the most part we've had
[01:17:20] incredibly incredible treatment from not just from well from from people from normal citizens you know
[01:17:27] that it's thank you for your service it's thank you for what you did regardless of whatever
[01:17:31] their political beliefs are as well it's like most people say hey we know that you were doing
[01:17:35] your job and and that's thank you did you feel mattered did you feel did you feel like it was
[01:17:42] did you get the negative feedback that we often hear about from Vietnam bets I never got any of
[01:17:47] the negative personally I know a lot of people who did and most of that was people who came back
[01:17:53] uningered we got off of that same transport a travel-sair force base or or up at Fort Lewis
[01:17:59] Washington moved to a civilian aircraft most of them would change out of their military clothing
[01:18:05] in the civilian clothing so that they couldn't be recognized or wouldn't be readily identified
[01:18:11] as being returning from Vietnam the only thing that I ever really experienced that I didn't
[01:18:16] know this until after I got to fit Simmons was lawrear force base used to be right in downtown
[01:18:21] Denver and that's normally where the transport would have brought me would have been to lawreary
[01:18:26] but because they were having protesters outside the gate at lawrear force base they landed in
[01:18:32] an old world war two-feel called Buckley Field outside of Denver and the protesters never knew
[01:18:37] where that was at so then they'd load you on the on the hospital bus and take you right to the
[01:18:42] hospital luckily the protesters weren't smart enough to figure that out so you get done with this
[01:18:48] you get discharged from the army that's it and now we go and now and now what's your what's your plan
[01:18:53] now didn't have the famous idea we should get tell you I'd really thought that went out in a big
[01:19:00] way but I mean I think you're you're kind of still in a form of survival mode at that point you know
[01:19:08] to mean each each new experience I mean getting in and out of the shower getting on and off
[01:19:17] of a commode feeding yourself putting clothes on wondering if you're gonna be able to drive again
[01:19:26] are the things that are paramount in your mind at that point because you know what it takes to
[01:19:32] do stuff out there in the world and I mean I would I would go to physical therapy I'd go to
[01:19:38] occupational therapy I'd come back to the ward and I'd be thinking about things and my my
[01:19:45] Catholic upbringing and in Minnesota and the Bible and things that take place I'm waiting for
[01:19:53] something outside my hospital ward window like a burning busher of bolt a lightning and there's
[01:20:00] going to be a revelation gymsurcely this is what you're going to do for the rest of your life
[01:20:05] it never happened it didn't come so you know now I'm still praying
[01:20:11] but I'm actually getting angry with God at this point because I'm not getting any answers
[01:20:19] and maybe's answering things but I'm not smart enough to recognize it I don't know
[01:20:24] but I think what I actually did at that point which I think is my survival and what allowed
[01:20:29] me to move forward with my life was I surrendered I just said I said to God here's the deal
[01:20:36] your job is to take care of a vision or things that you have in store for me for the rest of my
[01:20:44] life my job is to do occupational therapy physical therapy and maybe as new guys come in my
[01:20:51] job has helped inspire them to realize that they're still going to be a life beyond the
[01:20:57] injuries you've sustained and I mean it's not like you did that one day in the next day it was perfect
[01:21:03] you know it was still a process every day you'd have to kind of go through that little bit of
[01:21:08] surrender all the time until you finally just came to the conclusion that if you just relax
[01:21:15] do what you're supposed to do everything else is going to be okay in a truly turned out that way
[01:21:21] so that when you're going to occupational therapy is that when you're are you still at
[01:21:26] fit Simmons when you're talking about that right and so now you're helping people out you get this
[01:21:32] kind of point in your life where you say okay I'm going to do my part and I'm going to let God
[01:21:38] handle his part I'm not going to worry about what he's going to do with me I'm going to do what
[01:21:43] I'm supposed to do right now you do that for nine months when you get done at fit Simmons
[01:21:49] where do you go and when back home to Rochester Minnesota and stayed at my parents' house
[01:21:56] and I remember specifically the chief of physical medicine said to my mom when they were there
[01:22:03] said now whatever you do when you get him home I don't want you to wait on him all the time because
[01:22:09] that's the worst thing you can possibly do and you know they're explaining that to your mother
[01:22:14] and you're 21 years old and she knows this guy's full of shit because I'm going to go home and
[01:22:20] just bathe him like he was two years old so I sat on the couch for I mean not every day but
[01:22:27] on the couch and I tell her to bring me the remote and change the channel and give me a
[01:22:31] Pepsi and do all that kind of stuff and finally about 30 days in it I said something to her
[01:22:36] one day and she said why don't you get off your story ass and get it yourself and I said mom
[01:22:41] I just can't believe it took you 30 days to give me that response you're you're melted as long as
[01:22:47] you're here I said well I I don't know if you knew it mom but I overheard the chief of physical
[01:22:52] medicine tell you that so I had to use it so then once so you're living at home and what
[01:22:59] did that what did that look like it's kind of a scary experience because you're going back to
[01:23:08] an able-bodied world even though the male clinics there in Rochester Minnesota there's still
[01:23:14] streets don't have curb cuts buildings are not level to the ground every building doesn't have
[01:23:21] an elevator to get you to the second floor the Americas would disability act didn't come into
[01:23:27] play into the late 70s or early 80s so I mean it wasn't like anybody had to do anything to
[01:23:33] accommodate disabled people there were not a lot of disabled people on the street out in public
[01:23:41] either working or going to school or anything else they had there was a system off to the side
[01:23:47] I think for disabled people but I think the Vietnam veterans came back and were were vocal
[01:23:54] and pushy and just decided we weren't willing to accept that as being the standard and that's not
[01:24:01] what I want to do for the rest of my life so primarily I came back and I started junior college
[01:24:06] and then at least when you're in school there's vet groups at school so you had that sharing again
[01:24:13] I mean if I had difficult getting from one location or another I could holler at somebody they'd
[01:24:17] give me a push to my next class or carry books and I'd push whatever so I mean little by little you
[01:24:24] realized you got to swallow a little bit of pride and you may need that help at times if you're
[01:24:30] going to get back into civilian life if you're going to be part of it and if you want to join the
[01:24:34] human race that's what you're going to have to do is accept some help and some guidance along the way so
[01:24:41] that's what I did and little by little that just gets better every day and every week and every
[01:24:47] years so you see what did you start studying in school well I wanted to be a CPA
[01:24:53] until I actually got to all those big long ledger sheets and I said oh my god really
[01:24:59] I don't want to do this for the rest of my life so just I just changed the general business
[01:25:04] general business and then you graduate from junior college graduate from junior college
[01:25:13] went to what's now called the University of Central Florida was called FTU at the time
[01:25:18] continued towards the business degree but did not finish and get a degree but I finished
[01:25:25] about halfway through my senior year and then I went to work and what you go to work doing
[01:25:31] well I've been a real estate agent for 40 years in Florida and then I'm also a real estate investor
[01:25:37] and I have a small roofing company so straight from school you you must have started to delve
[01:25:45] into real estate before you decided you're going to leave school I had actually the guy I knew
[01:25:51] the guy real well that on the real estate company and he had asked me because they had a van
[01:25:56] a lot of people with wheelchairs use we would carry his real estate signs out the bigger ones
[01:26:03] and smaller ones and I would I would drive and he would put up the signs he was fairly new in the
[01:26:07] business too so I think that just sort of got me excited about what he was doing and I would he would
[01:26:13] say you need to go get your real estate license and said yeah when was the last time you bought a
[01:26:18] house from a guy in a wheelchair missing two legs in an army go add don't worry about it they'll
[01:26:22] never even notice I mean that's just the kind of guy he was it sounds like he was absolutely
[01:26:30] it doesn't take arms and a leg to explain to people that this thing is about through
[01:26:36] him central air and heat three bedrooms and all that kind of stuff usually most people are
[01:26:41] pretty intelligent lesser blind and they can't see it they can pretty well figure out what it is
[01:26:46] my pointing those things out doesn't make them want to buy it what it is and where it is
[01:26:51] is usually why they buy it and that was is that is that what you ended up doing for your whole
[01:26:57] career you said you've been doing it for four or you did it for 40 years or I got my real estate
[01:27:01] license in 1978 and then courses is part of selling things deals come along that are worth owning
[01:27:10] so I would buy him kept him for rental property and still have all those today
[01:27:14] nice moves I gotta ask you this because you know a lot of a lot of vets listen to this
[01:27:24] what did you see in terms of alcohol and drugs especially when you were in rehab when you're coming
[01:27:32] out of rehab what did you see what was your attitude how did you avoid going down the path of
[01:27:40] where people end up you know either addicted alcohol or addicted to drugs you know and that's a kind
[01:27:48] of a good question because there was a lot of that there were a lot of guys especially alcohol because
[01:27:52] you could just go off the base and and go someplace in the evening the drugs I think they were
[01:27:58] a little less likely to give you more than you actually needed during the Vietnam era that was my
[01:28:05] experience and my father was an alcoholic so I'm sure probably in the back of my mind the use of it
[01:28:13] or abuse of it was probably something I was conscious of all the time but that never really looked like
[01:28:20] that was a great alternative path I mean I thought that was fairly easy to recognize that
[01:28:27] that wasn't good and and I'm not critical of anyone that chose that because everybody's
[01:28:33] psyche and the way they're handling things at that time the difficulties you're going through
[01:28:38] or just being out in public missing two legs in a room maybe you need to be high to do that
[01:28:44] I never felt that way I didn't feel like I needed to explain anything to anybody
[01:28:48] had to put on any particular performance or airstone make people accept me if you didn't accept me
[01:28:54] I'm okay with that too you know what I mean that was fine because I'm just going to do
[01:28:59] what I need to do for my survival and for me to move forward and I had a lot of support from family
[01:29:06] and friends that allowed me to be that way man I wish I could spread that word to
[01:29:13] basically everyone you know not to worry about one other people I'd thank you what you're supposed to do
[01:29:21] at what point did you I what point did you did you link up with the with the DAV
[01:29:26] well the DAV initially gave me what they call a complementary membership all Vietnam
[01:29:32] era veterans that were injured got that that was in 1970 and then I moved from Minnesota to Florida
[01:29:40] in March of 1971 and my wife at the time said what are you going to do about that membership in the DAV
[01:29:48] and I said you know I really hadn't given it much thought I was busy with with the job that I'd
[01:29:54] moved there for and I know she looked it up I think when time said well there's a chapter in
[01:29:59] Sanford so I actually started going welcome me with open arms it was a nice friendly group of people
[01:30:06] and I mean it it was a great great great great relationship with them and I needed that so maybe
[01:30:14] she was even smarter than I was to recognize that it's nice to be able to go back and associate
[01:30:21] with other disabled veterans because you're actually there to lift that person up and bring them
[01:30:28] along and they're there to do the same thing for you you can be an inspiration great not maybe
[01:30:33] you can be inspired by somebody that's there so that's my initial strong involvement on the
[01:30:39] local chapter level was in Sanford Florida Seminal chapter 30 and then just stayed involved constantly
[01:30:47] I mean you know we're 50 years this year DAV is going to celebrate their 100th anniversary
[01:30:53] I'm going to celebrate my 50th anniversary being a member of the DAV now you mentioned that
[01:30:59] in that whole thing that you had begun married at some point where here was that I got married in
[01:31:04] February 1970 to a young lady that I met in the community of Denver, Colorado so that was that was
[01:31:14] while you were at Fitt Simmons no I was home okay matter when I was at Fitt Simmons got married back
[01:31:20] in Rochester Minnesota got it and then did you you did you ended up having kids with her two children
[01:31:26] two two boys we're now 44 or 45 and 43 years old that's awesome then you moved up through the ranks
[01:31:37] of the DAV correct well I did a lot of stuff in the local chapter then I got involved on the
[01:31:42] department level which is what we call our state organizations became an officer in the state
[01:31:48] went through all the chairs and became you know a department commander and then obviously people who had
[01:31:54] been in the national organization before recognize it maybe I could be a national officer asked me if I
[01:32:01] would consider doing that so in 1999 I initially got elected to what we call the fourth junior
[01:32:07] vice commander the beginning of your working your way up to be a national commander so now we're talking
[01:32:15] 1999 where were you on on September 11th 2001 I was home in a popga and what did that when you saw that
[01:32:29] I mean obviously you must have heard the word drums like everybody else what were what were you thinking
[01:32:33] I mean almost unbelievable to begin with that could ever happen here on American soil
[01:32:40] and then I don't know where I was originally but then my wife had hollered to me and
[01:32:45] and the plane was at the second building by the time I got front of the television and I mean
[01:32:51] we knew it was real I mean it's it's a shock to think that anything like that can happen in two buildings full of
[01:32:57] people just unbelievable now did you immediately I mean we were in an afghanistan
[01:33:06] bi October when you think in yourself where there's war there's gonna be wounded
[01:33:12] and the DAV and year you know you talked about how much it helped you to meet somebody that was a triple
[01:33:19] ampute two months before you three months before you they didn't even have much experience with it
[01:33:25] but it was enough to make you say okay if they can make it I can make it did you think to yourself
[01:33:31] here we go again I don't know whether I ever came to that conclusion that early on
[01:33:37] but as you know it didn't take long before we started getting wounded back
[01:33:41] and as long as I was a national officer I always asked if I could go up to DC and spend a day or two
[01:33:49] so I could go through wall to read and spend time visiting young men and women coming back from
[01:33:54] Iraq and Afghanistan so I look forward to having that opportunity to do that and one of the
[01:34:01] guys I mean this is fast forwarding some but a young man came back at injured in September of 2004
[01:34:08] and he was also a triple ampute he lost both legs and an arm and you because of the hip
[01:34:14] a law as you had to go through and get permission to visit people in the hospital well he had originally
[01:34:20] been on our list and then he'd scratched the DAV off of that because they were kind of getting
[01:34:26] tired of politicians just coming into in photo ops with seriously injured vets so he kind of thought
[01:34:32] that's what it was well we were visiting another young guy there was a single leg amputee on the
[01:34:39] physical therapy ward and he was in a bed maybe 15 feet away so he called the officer over that
[01:34:45] was with us and said who the hell's that guy said well that's the guy was going to come to visit
[01:34:51] and goes oh hell I'll see him you know because we were we were one in the same so my wife was with
[01:34:57] me on that trip as well too so we went over to the bed when we finished with this first young man
[01:35:02] and talked you're a little bit and it's not a matter that you're going to be doing any great
[01:35:07] wonderful pep talk it's kind of just more a matter of explaining I'm just exactly like you were
[01:35:15] I've been in that bed it was back in in you know 1969 I've been through a lot of difficulties but
[01:35:22] you're going to be okay you're alive his mother and his fiance were standing at the end of the bed
[01:35:28] and my wife was talking to them and I truly believe that she was probably more inspirational and
[01:35:34] more informative to them than I ever was with him in that one initial meeting he'd after we'd
[01:35:41] have to see each other multiple times as he started to grow a little bit and get out of bed and get
[01:35:47] into a wheelchair where he pretty well understands he is going to be okay it is going to be better
[01:35:54] and today which is I don't know how many years ago is that 25 or something maybe more than that
[01:36:00] he's college educated got a wife two children hugely successful and you know I could probably
[01:36:07] say well part of that was my inspiration but I think part of that was the grit he was raised with
[01:36:12] the kid from Michigan as well too he was probably going to be okay no matter what happened but
[01:36:18] you know to see him do that makes me feel extremely good that younger generation is picking up on
[01:36:25] that and they're moving forward and getting along with their lives as well too yeah no that's
[01:36:30] yeah that's that's unbelievable I mean obviously you might not feel like you may feel like
[01:36:39] you would have done it anyways but you know anything that you do in life when you see that someone
[01:36:44] else has done it and and you know it's possible I mean that's so much of the battle right there
[01:36:49] is just knowing that something can be done and for someone to look at you and see that you got
[01:36:55] kids and you got wife and you got business and you got damn apartment complexes and whatnot and
[01:37:02] you carry you carry on for someone that's however old 19 20 23 years old and say okay I've been
[01:37:10] putting this rough spot but I can but I can do this he did it if he did it I can do it that's a
[01:37:17] man that's that's that's worth it's weight and gold is there anything that that we can do to help
[01:37:30] out the the DAV anything that just people that are listening to the show that that recognize the
[01:37:38] the benefits that that the DAV provides what's the best thing for people to do to support it
[01:37:44] well I mean I think there's a lot of different things in their local community there's
[01:37:48] opportunities at local chapters there's a department level donations to our national organization
[01:37:54] that allow us to continue to do great things every single day I think the numbers we're talking
[01:38:00] about right now is we provide service to over a million veterans every single year and it may not
[01:38:08] be the same service of service work when the claims representation it might be transportation
[01:38:13] to and from VA medical centers for guys that don't have a way to get there for their doctors
[01:38:18] appointments they might we might be volunteers and hospitals we can use help in all those areas
[01:38:25] from the American public so the the website is DAV.org they're actually quite high speed on their
[01:38:36] social media they have Twitter which is at DAV HQ they have Instagram which is also at DAV
[01:38:43] HQ and then they have Facebook which is just at DAV and anyone can get on there they have
[01:38:51] pretty good you know it's pretty simple to figure out how you can help how you can volunteer
[01:38:56] how you can donate to that to that awesome cause and you know I started off this podcast with
[01:39:03] a quote from you when you were talking about how lucky you were and and even just before we before
[01:39:11] we pressed record today you were you were explaining you were just saying to me you know you've
[01:39:17] had this life that you wouldn't trade any part of it and I think anybody that's that's listening
[01:39:27] to you seeing you talk here you talk to have that attitude and maintain that attitude that is
[01:39:34] that is the most powerful thing that a person can have for you to be in the situation that you
[01:39:39] were in 90 pounds lost both your legs lost your arm and to get up and move forward I mean that
[01:39:49] that mentality is it's it's it's unbelievable it's it's it's it's miraculous and it's and it's
[01:39:57] it's inspirational when you look back now do you ever feel do you feel like this was the way it was
[01:40:08] meant to be well I think because of my faith in God I believe that nothing happens to you that
[01:40:16] that he doesn't think you can handle that's the way I prayed my entire life is it is not I don't
[01:40:23] praise so that I wake up tomorrow morning and I've got two legs in an arm I pray that I have the
[01:40:28] same opportunity tomorrow that I had today or maybe maybe something more I can do tomorrow not
[01:40:34] so much but I'm asking for something so I think really truly the best thing that I can say is
[01:40:41] my injury is from the neck down but my ability to continue on is from the neck up it's it's the
[01:40:49] way you think and what you want to do is again from the neck up if somebody said well how in the
[01:40:56] world can you have a a roofing company well that's really easy I don't get on the roof you
[01:41:02] mean that doesn't look like that be a whole lot of fun it's easier for me to get customers do the
[01:41:08] estimates and do the money part of it and and hire people that do the work so but I never looked at
[01:41:15] that said well you can't do that if you're missing two legs in arm sure you can you can do anything
[01:41:20] if you're missing two legs in arm anybody out there are DAV members or anybody that sustain any
[01:41:26] form of an injury that wants to give up I'm just here to tell you you don't need to give up don't
[01:41:32] ever give up there's a challenge out they're just accept a challenge and move forward well I don't
[01:41:39] think I have anything else to say after that you got anything else that's the floor is yours
[01:41:49] I just want to thank you again I know we did it the beginning of the podcast but thank you
[01:41:53] for the opportunity for allowing DAV and meet a commissar representative to be on the program with you I hope
[01:42:02] we got millions of people out there that heard the podcast or will hear it in the future and that
[01:42:07] they'll remember that the DAV is if they're a veteran it's there for them and their family and
[01:42:11] dependents if they're a member of the American public that would just like to reach out and do
[01:42:16] something to help their fellow disabled veterans you can get all the DAV.org just like you mentioned
[01:42:23] before we would welcome the opportunity you would come to us and offer to help.
[01:42:28] Well I'm sure that folks will definitely do that and I know you're thinking me for having you out
[01:42:36] here but this is it's absolutely honor for me to be able to sit here and talk with you and thank you
[01:42:43] for coming on this show and thanks for sharing your experiences and more important thank you for your
[01:42:49] service for your sacrifice and not just what you did you know in Vietnam but for what you've done
[01:42:56] with the DAV and what you've done to help you know my generation of warriors who have suffered
[01:43:04] greatly and who are able to look at you as a mentor and as an inspiration so that they can do exactly
[01:43:12] what you said which is never give up and keep moving forward so with that thank you for coming
[01:43:21] on the show and thank you for everything thank you Jack will appreciate it and with that
[01:43:30] Mr. Sersley has left the building how does that man not change your attitude about just about
[01:43:42] everything that you do all the day to day basis yeah oh yeah big time and he said something
[01:43:47] that kind of this is real small but I was like it's different when you're talking about um how
[01:43:54] or when he was talking about how he didn't drink and do that and his that's all call it so
[01:43:59] that's like that's not just oh yeah I just didn't but the way he said it was this he was like
[01:44:06] I knew that that wasn't a path I was going to go go down right but then he said and I want to kind
[01:44:11] of let I'm paraphrasing obviously I want to let everyone know that you don't you don't have to give up
[01:44:16] or something he said he didn't say don't give up like a bit this big thing it's like he said
[01:44:21] you don't need to give up do kind of thing because it when my mind anyway it seemed like
[01:44:26] like like giving up seems like such a viable option you know yeah for sure and these like oh no
[01:44:33] you don't need to do that you don't need to do that like kind of like no you can actually do this
[01:44:37] other thing kind of thing like he made it sound so casual what almost like hey it's almost like
[01:44:43] he he reversed it all the way back down to the bare decision making of it you know rather than like
[01:44:49] oh there's hard battle or whatever it's hard battle 100% but that's not what he was focusing on
[01:44:54] the way he said it that's what it sounded like you know like all men that's kind of an interesting sort
[01:44:59] of way to present it yeah you don't need to give up sometimes we stop record to you because you
[01:45:05] just told a really cool story about the fact that his first sergeant was telling him hey
[01:45:14] if you stay in you get a $10,000 realness component and a brand new Corvette which you can order
[01:45:20] here we'll get delivered to your house for $5,500 and you know what he said hey hey listen
[01:45:28] for sergeant there's people here trying to kill me if I'm good so well by my own Corvette when
[01:45:35] I get home so you know and that's when you when you hear a guy like him you just realize that
[01:45:42] there's so much more that we're capable of overcoming and and he's singing he's lucky and it's just
[01:45:52] if he's lucky to be here we're all lucky to be here and what we need to do is make sure we take
[01:45:59] advantage of the opportunities that we have getting our attitude straight
[01:46:07] being on the path staying on the path so echo Charles speaking to the path yes what can we do
[01:46:14] well as we always talk about first two just two we can do two we're at victory MMA in the main
[01:46:24] where we call this corridor we call it a corridor we're in the kind of lounge this is the lounge area
[01:46:31] oddly enough I have to admit that I have a lounge area in my gym right instead of having more
[01:46:36] squat racks still in case you got a lounge area yeah this is the echo Charles lounge area
[01:46:41] I prefer to call it the recovery area okay so anyways we got nice couches
[01:46:48] unless we're here yeah and yes so this is where we can do jitsu kudos more Matt space here by the way
[01:46:56] side note yeah more jitsu we got a lot of jitsu going on here yes you can pretty much do jitsu a lot here

[01:48:11] critical supplements to stay in the game and if you don't think they're critical try not taking
[01:48:15] them yeah it's not a good idea join warfare cruel oil combo my suggestion recommendation
[01:48:21] strong repetition recommendation uh one more thing we've got right now so we have discipline
[01:48:26] in a powder form and it's sort of like a pre mission cognitive and physical enhancement
[01:48:33] so we just came out with a new flavor the new flavor is called jaccopommer it's 50% iced tea
[01:48:41] 50% lemonade and it's really really really good it's in fact it's all I'm drinking right now
[01:48:48] unless I'm having a discipline going to can wait so the the one you have the jaccopommer that's
[01:48:55] the powder one yeah it's not just when go it's discipline yes and discipline go in a can
[01:49:01] jaccopommer is coming okay we're gonna cover all the bases we also got dac savage
[01:49:07] what is that that's another quote of Myers decoda Myers custom what no no no wait better
[01:49:16] a signature signature signature from decoda what flavor the flavor is called cherry vanilla
[01:49:25] which if you know anything about flavors that's basically a doctor pepper what okay so it's
[01:49:32] sedax savage is the name of the flavor yes discipline from decoda Myers that tastes like
[01:49:40] doctor pepper decoda Myers signature signature flavor yeah signature flavor so anyways I'm coming
[01:49:46] out to the next and we all got milk for your protein or you can call it protein or you can just
[01:49:52] call it dessert dessert I do prefer to call dessert because that's basically what it tastes like
[01:49:57] do would you ever and and this thought flashed in my head last night almost almost not going to
[01:50:04] admit it but I'm gonna tell you because you know I've known you for a long time so it trust you
[01:50:08] so I had a little thing of leftover rocky road ice cream not for me it was it was my son's birthday
[01:50:14] a while back and so far my wife did not want to get my bunch of you know sugar well there was
[01:50:20] a lot left we didn't eat that much but so I busted it out left him on the counter can I eat
[01:50:25] some and sort of forgot about it in my whatever it melted oh but it's in the what he called I don't
[01:50:31] know if it's a pint the be the one but you have to figure the half count yeah coming in hot so I'm
[01:50:36] like all right whatever so for milk shit involuntary milk shit so I'm pounding this rocky road ice
[01:50:44] cream milkshake out of the container by the way it's nighttime nobody saw but I'm pounding
[01:50:50] Martian there's a little marshmallows in there little nuts what's in rockerwood like almond or
[01:50:54] no almond or walnut yeah we're doing it some kind of nuts yeah nuts yeah and marshmallow
[01:51:00] yeah and all soft now anyway it's not bad it was good did you put milk in there but I'm thinking
[01:51:06] no it didn't see I could but it would sort of what it did but what if you put marshmallows and nuts
[01:51:12] in mock you could do that it'd kind of be the same thing I don't like marshmallows by the way yeah
[01:51:17] I don't either I don't like marshmallows I don't like any marshmallows except let's face it
[01:51:22] whatever those kinds of marshmallows are that are in lucky charms right right right right right
[01:51:27] oh yeah those things when I was a kid I was I was all about those lucky charms and the crazy thing
[01:51:32] is it was just normal you just Saturday morning this is a thing you used to be a thing cartoons
[01:51:38] Saturday morning that's what that's what kids did yeah those lucky charms marshmallows are
[01:51:42] so they're kind of odd because like I mean I guess hey if you dig on my dig it but those the dehydrated
[01:51:47] ones when you eat them you get the you know that like nails against the chalkboard feeling on the
[01:51:51] Chomp those dehydrated mushrooms you know I would probably I probably haven't had any of that since I was
[01:51:55] in Iraq it's really the last time I had some lucky charms like there was some box in the
[01:51:59] whatever yeah I don't know man I was like you can't dig it so cinnamon toast cr- I think
[01:52:05] that cinnamon toast crunch back and then I think that was like the weakness cereal one oh you know
[01:52:09] this is bad but it's I think we might have just gotten off track because we're talking about lucky
[01:52:13] charms and cinnamon crunch yeah that is not on the path that's what we're talking about yeah
[01:52:17] smoke additional protein taste delicious and for kids instead of feeding your kids cereal or
[01:52:22] rocky road ice cream give if you would have told your son heck that's your birthday here's a
[01:52:27] strawberry milkshake yeah and you gave him strawberry milk you'd have been totally pumped
[01:52:30] and healthy and stronger when you didn't do that don't forget about chocolate white tea as well

[02:03:13] Mr. Jim surzly for sharing his story with us and i am it's such an honor for me to be able to talk
[02:03:25] with such men and women who have given so much and yet they continue to give and to all the other
[02:03:33] veterans out there to those that have served and those that are serving and those that are holding
[02:03:38] the line as we speak thanks to each one of you for fighting for our freedom and to our police and
[02:03:46] law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers
[02:03:52] and border patrol and secret service and all the first responders each of you work so hard and give
[02:04:00] so much to keep us safe here at home so thanks to all of you as well for your service and to everyone
[02:04:07] else out there you just heard another example of what the human will is capable of
[02:04:16] and even when facing the most unimaginable challenges even when ripped apart by a bomb
[02:04:27] the will to live and the will to fight and the will to overcome is unstoppable and what that
[02:04:38] makes me wonder what are we capable of what are we capable of if we summoned the kind of will that
[02:04:54] Jim certainly has are we doing everything right now that we are capable of doing are we reaching
[02:05:06] our potential how much more could we do how much more could we do there's only one way to find out
[02:05:22] and that is to step up into the breach to put yourself out there every day and do everything you
[02:05:28] possibly can to get after it and until next time this is echo and jacco out
