00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.80 This is Jockelpontcast number 252 with Dave Burke and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:08.80 --> 00:00:09.80 Good evening Dave.
00:00:09.80 --> 00:00:10.80 Good evening.
00:00:10.80 --> 00:00:17.04 EchoTrolls is taking care of some other business on the last podcast.
00:00:17.04 --> 00:00:20.60 Number 251 with Lave Babin.
00:00:20.60 --> 00:00:26.92 We started getting into the book guidelines for the leader and commander by General Bruce
00:00:26.92 --> 00:00:27.92 Clark.
00:00:27.92 --> 00:00:33.72 We only made it 13 pages into and a half hours and it's a 117 page book.
00:00:33.72 --> 00:00:38.16 Just to recap a little bit, this is a book that I searched for for over a decade.
00:00:38.16 --> 00:00:44.04 I originally heard about this book in my favorite book, which is called About Face by Colonel
00:00:44.04 --> 00:00:45.20 David Hackworth.
00:00:45.20 --> 00:00:50.32 I finally found a copy a month and a half ago.
00:00:50.32 --> 00:00:52.48 And so here we are just a little background.
00:00:52.48 --> 00:00:55.32 Once again on General Bruce Clark.
00:00:55.32 --> 00:00:59.92 Number 21 World War II Korea, and listed in 1917, and they have gone to West Point, Colonel
00:00:59.92 --> 00:01:03.96 World War II, then a general commanded the Fourth Armored Division in Patton's Third
00:01:03.96 --> 00:01:13.64 Army, Battle of the Bulge, Distinguished Service Cross, Three Silver Stars, 45 years of service.
00:01:13.64 --> 00:01:18.80 And then spend a bunch of time not only leading troops, but also training troops, or overseeing
00:01:18.80 --> 00:01:19.92 training commands.
00:01:19.92 --> 00:01:26.92 So awesome career, Hackworth talked about him glowingly in the book about face.
00:01:26.92 --> 00:01:31.44 And that's where the start of taking me a long time to find this book.
00:01:31.44 --> 00:01:36.24 Who did somebody texted me about it and said it was the white whale.
00:01:36.24 --> 00:01:38.16 Like, you know, this was that it was.
00:01:38.16 --> 00:01:40.92 Definitely hard for me to find this book, but we have it.
00:01:40.92 --> 00:01:41.92 And that's it.
00:01:41.92 --> 00:01:42.92 That's what we're going to do.
00:01:42.92 --> 00:01:44.48 We're going to go back into this book.
00:01:44.48 --> 00:01:50.84 So here we go back into guidelines for the leader and commander by Bruce General Bruce
00:01:50.84 --> 00:01:52.68 C. Clark.
00:01:52.68 --> 00:02:00.32 So this section starts off with administration, some thoughts for the commander.
00:02:00.32 --> 00:02:06.40 And he says, insumation, I would like to point out the close interrelationship between
00:02:06.40 --> 00:02:10.56 training programs and sound overall management.
00:02:10.56 --> 00:02:15.96 So this is something, you know, when you're that young, gun-hole leader, that's just
00:02:15.96 --> 00:02:20.40 things, hey, where you're to operate, whatever that operation is, whether it's shoot machine
00:02:20.40 --> 00:02:23.88 guns or whether that's out, selling things or making things.
00:02:23.88 --> 00:02:26.04 And you think, hey, I'm on the front line.
00:02:26.04 --> 00:02:27.48 I'm going to make things happen.
00:02:27.48 --> 00:02:31.36 And you think all the administrative stuff you shouldn't have to worry about.
00:02:31.36 --> 00:02:34.56 That's not me.
00:02:34.56 --> 00:02:37.84 And I know many individuals that are like that.
00:02:37.84 --> 00:02:42.40 I know one individual in particular, that's like that whose name is Jockel.
00:02:42.40 --> 00:02:44.96 Because I was definitely like that.
00:02:44.96 --> 00:02:49.12 Many commanders, I was like that when I was younger.
00:02:49.12 --> 00:02:53.28 Because I absolutely, I'd realize this and you can hear, you know, we'll talk about the
00:02:53.28 --> 00:02:57.88 paperwork drills that we had to do and how life and Seth came to me.
00:02:57.88 --> 00:02:58.88 We should not have to do this stuff.
00:02:58.88 --> 00:02:59.88 And I said, oh, we're going to do it.
00:02:59.88 --> 00:03:01.68 We're going to do it better than anybody else.
00:03:01.68 --> 00:03:07.32 So I figured this out, but it is definitely a learning moment that people have.
00:03:07.32 --> 00:03:09.20 And so why not learn it right now.
00:03:09.20 --> 00:03:11.64 Many commanders are defeated by poor administration.
00:03:11.64 --> 00:03:13.84 Imagine that.
00:03:13.84 --> 00:03:15.16 This is that statement.
00:03:15.16 --> 00:03:18.68 Many commanders are defeated by poor administration.
00:03:18.68 --> 00:03:22.36 Not defeated because they were tactfully on sound, not defeated because they made bad decisions,
00:03:22.36 --> 00:03:24.76 not defeated because they couldn't come up with a good plan.
00:03:24.76 --> 00:03:31.64 They just fail because they're administrative losers.
00:03:31.64 --> 00:03:36.20 Without sound administration, a commander cannot succeed in his training and maintenance programs.
00:03:36.20 --> 00:03:40.52 The administration is nothing more than applied common sense.
00:03:40.52 --> 00:03:45.96 I'm including here a number of items that may well be considered a checklist of indicators
00:03:45.96 --> 00:03:49.24 of sound administration.
00:03:49.24 --> 00:03:54.92 Number one, importance of time.
00:03:54.92 --> 00:03:59.64 The principal coordinating device in the army is time.
00:03:59.64 --> 00:04:04.44 Learn the proper time space factors so you can be on time and make reasonable demands
00:04:04.44 --> 00:04:06.16 of your subordinates.
00:04:06.16 --> 00:04:15.16 So that's number one by the way, which is probably why you hear a lot of talk about time management.
00:04:15.16 --> 00:04:18.40 Just think about the idea that the first thing he's going to say is time.
00:04:18.40 --> 00:04:23.92 This is someone who clearly understands that of all the resources in the world that we have.
00:04:23.92 --> 00:04:27.80 That's the one that matters the most because we just can't produce more of that.
00:04:27.80 --> 00:04:30.40 I was going to say it's the one that matters the most.
00:04:30.40 --> 00:04:32.92 And it's the absolute one that we have the least control.
00:04:32.92 --> 00:04:34.24 You know how much control do we have time?
00:04:34.24 --> 00:04:35.000 You have zero.
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.92 You cannot stop it. You cannot bring it back.
00:04:36.92 --> 00:04:39.04 You got to say, I have the power curve.
00:04:39.04 --> 00:04:41.04 I hate that feeling.
00:04:41.04 --> 00:04:42.16 I hate that feeling.
00:04:42.16 --> 00:04:45.08 And let me tell you what.
00:04:45.08 --> 00:04:46.28 I realize this a while back.
00:04:46.28 --> 00:04:51.20 So when you go to the airport, if you show up to the airport late,
00:04:51.20 --> 00:04:54.92 and now look, TSA doesn't care that your late.
00:04:54.92 --> 00:04:57.68 The baggage handler doesn't care that your late.
00:04:57.68 --> 00:05:00.60 The Uber driver does not care what time your plane is leaving.
00:05:00.60 --> 00:05:02.76 They're doing what they're doing.
00:05:02.76 --> 00:05:08.56 And so what that does is it takes you have no control over that time once it started to
00:05:08.56 --> 00:05:09.24 commence.
00:05:09.24 --> 00:05:10.56 What do you have control over?
00:05:10.56 --> 00:05:12.000 Going to the airport a little bit earlier.
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.76 That's all.
00:05:12.76 --> 00:05:13.28 That's all.
00:05:13.28 --> 00:05:14.28 Not that big of a deal.
00:05:14.28 --> 00:05:15.88 Go to the airport a little bit earlier.
00:05:15.88 --> 00:05:17.28 And you won't have to worry about TSA.
00:05:17.28 --> 00:05:18.32 You won't have to worry about baggage.
00:05:18.32 --> 00:05:22.52 You won't have to worry about how long it takes for the Uber driver or the lift.
00:05:22.52 --> 00:05:28.88 Let's give proper credit or lift driver to show up and bring you to the airport.
00:05:28.88 --> 00:05:34.16 So how do you get control? You can't control time once it's unfolding.
00:05:34.16 --> 00:05:35.44 You can't bring it back.
00:05:35.44 --> 00:05:39.52 You have to plan for it appropriately.
00:05:39.52 --> 00:05:41.76 And there's a sense of urgency.
00:05:41.76 --> 00:05:44.08 And I don't have a pretty good sense of urgency.
00:05:44.08 --> 00:05:46.08 And you may or may not.
00:05:46.08 --> 00:05:50.80 I know like at the master, especially the earlier musters when we weren't when the
00:05:50.80 --> 00:05:54.36 backside wasn't quite the well-oiled machine that it is now.
00:05:54.36 --> 00:05:58.24 And certainly as a well-oiled machine now, the early musters, it was not a well-oiled
00:05:58.24 --> 00:05:58.76 machine.
00:05:58.76 --> 00:06:04.76 On the front side, people wouldn't know that when life and I were walking out on stage
00:06:04.76 --> 00:06:09.24 at eight o'clock in the morning, we had two hours of sleep because we had to do so whatever
00:06:09.24 --> 00:06:10.48 we had to do behind the scenes.
00:06:10.48 --> 00:06:13.000 And that's just the way it was.
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.12 I can feel when the shortage of time.
00:06:18.12 --> 00:06:21.88 In fact, I think I feel the shortage of time every single day, every single waking
00:06:21.88 --> 00:06:25.52 minute.
00:06:25.52 --> 00:06:28.72 There's a thing that happened at some point in my life.
00:06:28.72 --> 00:06:30.08 I don't know what when that was.
00:06:30.08 --> 00:06:31.24 But I still think about it now.
00:06:31.24 --> 00:06:33.92 When you were just talking about the feeling, what I thought you were going to talk about
00:06:33.92 --> 00:06:36.96 is the feeling of when you feel like you don't have enough time to do something.
00:06:36.96 --> 00:06:41.32 So being later or whatever, or how I got stuff I needed to prepare for, it used to be
00:06:41.32 --> 00:06:44.32 that I used to feel that it wasn't enough time.
00:06:44.32 --> 00:06:47.84 And the feeling that makes me sick now is at any time I'm behind.
00:06:47.84 --> 00:06:48.84 Which happens.
00:06:48.84 --> 00:06:49.84 I look at like, man, I'm behind.
00:06:49.84 --> 00:06:50.84 I didn't get enough done here.
00:06:50.84 --> 00:06:51.84 I didn't prep enough here.
00:06:51.84 --> 00:06:56.28 Feeling that bothers me the most is looking back on the time that I wasted the day before
00:06:56.28 --> 00:06:59.76 or the week before when I thought, hey, this is now I need to get ahead.
00:06:59.76 --> 00:07:00.76 I got a little window.
00:07:00.76 --> 00:07:03.64 I got some white space here, which is actually pretty rare.
00:07:03.64 --> 00:07:07.20 And I look back on the time that I wasted, which is very different than there isn't
00:07:07.20 --> 00:07:08.20 enough time.
00:07:08.20 --> 00:07:11.92 I honestly don't think I've ever felt like I didn't have enough time.
00:07:11.92 --> 00:07:15.20 I always feel like I have wasted time.
00:07:15.20 --> 00:07:19.74 And that feeling of when I'm behind or unprepared, man, that drives me nuts as I look
00:07:19.74 --> 00:07:22.70 back on what did I do yesterday or the day before?
00:07:22.70 --> 00:07:27.30 How did I waste so much time knowing that I can't get that back?
00:07:27.30 --> 00:07:28.58 And that's the feeling that bothers me.
00:07:28.58 --> 00:07:32.38 I think more than any other feeling is I wasted my time.
00:07:32.38 --> 00:07:34.50 Yeah, that's a, that is a doozy.
00:07:34.50 --> 00:07:38.78 And this is, by the way, item number one.
00:07:38.78 --> 00:07:42.46 Item number one, importance of time.
00:07:42.46 --> 00:07:44.70 Next, anticipate problems.
00:07:44.70 --> 00:07:49.18 Troublesome incidents or situations can be avoided if the probable consequences of existing
00:07:49.18 --> 00:07:53.02 conditions are previously anticipated.
00:07:53.02 --> 00:07:58.70 Incidents do not occur until the stage has been set for some time.
00:07:58.70 --> 00:08:04.38 The outstanding officer knows where things are likely to go wrong and plans preventive
00:08:04.38 --> 00:08:07.46 action.
00:08:07.46 --> 00:08:13.78 Spend a little bit of time thinking of through contingencies and then come up with a plan.
00:08:13.78 --> 00:08:16.50 And you don't even have to come up with this elaborate plan.
00:08:16.50 --> 00:08:24.58 You just have to know what you're going to do in a broad sense.
00:08:24.58 --> 00:08:28.18 Next, personality of the commander.
00:08:28.18 --> 00:08:32.58 Personality of the commander has an enormous influence on his unit.
00:08:32.58 --> 00:08:38.50 In fact, the unit may be said to be nothing but an extension of the commander's personality.
00:08:38.50 --> 00:08:44.74 It is essential that he makes his presence felt by leaving his desk to appear where work
00:08:44.74 --> 00:08:52.98 and training go on and by talking to and knowing and influencing his men.
00:08:52.98 --> 00:08:55.42 How many times did you see that in the Marine Corps?
00:08:55.42 --> 00:08:57.78 How about going for like checking into a squadron?
00:08:57.78 --> 00:09:00.86 How much would the squadron reflect the commander of the squadron?
00:09:00.86 --> 00:09:01.86 Completely.
00:09:01.86 --> 00:09:04.42 I mean, that was the always the ultimate difference.
00:09:04.42 --> 00:09:07.94 Because the thing about squadrons, it's probably true in a seal team, is that if you look
00:09:07.94 --> 00:09:10.50 at the squadrons from the outside, I was base at Miramar.
00:09:10.50 --> 00:09:13.54 There were seven F-18 squadrons when I was there.
00:09:13.54 --> 00:09:15.78 One paper that are all identical.
00:09:15.78 --> 00:09:16.78 Same equipment.
00:09:16.78 --> 00:09:19.10 Same not every metric that you would measure it.
00:09:19.10 --> 00:09:20.10 It's all the same.
00:09:20.10 --> 00:09:24.02 There isn't one squadron, like they get better stuff or better people.
00:09:24.02 --> 00:09:26.94 They just get the same thing that everybody else gets.
00:09:26.94 --> 00:09:30.82 And the only difference was obviously the commander or the leader and the squadrons would
00:09:30.82 --> 00:09:34.06 take on those personalities.
00:09:34.06 --> 00:09:36.66 Almost immediately when the new commander take over.
00:09:36.66 --> 00:09:41.30 It's not, it's crazy.
00:09:41.30 --> 00:09:42.30 It's crazy.
00:09:42.30 --> 00:09:45.14 It's just an extension of the boat crew story and extreme ownership.
00:09:45.14 --> 00:09:46.14 Hey, we swap out.
00:09:46.14 --> 00:09:48.94 We put in a good leader into this boat crew that's failing and all of a sudden you've
00:09:48.94 --> 00:09:52.78 got this totally legit boat crew that's winning.
00:09:52.78 --> 00:09:53.78 And that happens.
00:09:53.78 --> 00:09:55.50 How many people in a squadron?
00:09:55.50 --> 00:09:56.50 200.
00:09:56.50 --> 00:09:57.86 200 people.
00:09:57.86 --> 00:09:58.86 How many aircraft?
00:09:58.86 --> 00:09:59.86 12.
00:09:59.86 --> 00:10:00.86 12 aircraft.
00:10:00.86 --> 00:10:01.86 200 people.
00:10:01.86 --> 00:10:02.86 And boom.
00:10:02.86 --> 00:10:04.62 You put a good leader in there.
00:10:04.62 --> 00:10:06.02 But I will say this, though.
00:10:06.02 --> 00:10:07.86 Well, you can correct me if I'm wrong.
00:10:07.86 --> 00:10:19.90 But the Marine Corps from my experience has a tighter group, a tighter variance on their
00:10:19.90 --> 00:10:25.98 officers than, well, then certainly in the sealed teams.
00:10:25.98 --> 00:10:29.22 So in other words, you might get in the sealed teams.
00:10:29.22 --> 00:10:32.42 You might get these outstanding officers.
00:10:32.42 --> 00:10:35.90 And then you'd get some really good officers, some solid officers that kind of like the
00:10:35.90 --> 00:10:36.90 normal.
00:10:36.90 --> 00:10:38.26 You have some really kick ass guys.
00:10:38.26 --> 00:10:39.42 You have a bunch of normal guys.
00:10:39.42 --> 00:10:43.54 And then you have the bottom group, which would be pretty outside the range.
00:10:43.54 --> 00:10:45.50 So the range would be pretty big.
00:10:45.50 --> 00:10:48.86 It seemed to me like the Marine Corps always had just tight.
00:10:48.86 --> 00:10:49.86 It's more controlled.
00:10:49.86 --> 00:10:51.14 It's a more controlled group.
00:10:51.14 --> 00:10:53.58 It's a tighter group.
00:10:53.58 --> 00:11:00.14 Maybe the high end is not as often that you're going to get some just guy that's outside
00:11:00.14 --> 00:11:02.14 the box of stellar.
00:11:02.14 --> 00:11:05.30 Look, maybe I don't know.
00:11:05.30 --> 00:11:06.66 But I do know this.
00:11:06.66 --> 00:11:12.94 The chances of having a Marine Corps platoon commander that doesn't meet the grade isn't
00:11:12.94 --> 00:11:15.54 very low.
00:11:15.54 --> 00:11:19.82 And in the sealed teams, it would happen more often because there's more slack.
00:11:19.82 --> 00:11:20.98 There's more room.
00:11:20.98 --> 00:11:22.98 You're giving more rope to hang yourself.
00:11:22.98 --> 00:11:24.26 And you give guys rope.
00:11:24.26 --> 00:11:27.38 And they can take that rope and they can turn it into something awesome or they can
00:11:27.38 --> 00:11:29.02 make it hang themselves.
00:11:29.02 --> 00:11:31.82 I always kind of notice that.
00:11:31.82 --> 00:11:36.82 Yeah, I think that's right.
00:11:36.82 --> 00:11:39.90 And when you're inside that, the disparity or that variance becomes more evident to you as
00:11:39.90 --> 00:11:41.06 you're inside that.
00:11:41.06 --> 00:11:42.06 And you can see that.
00:11:42.06 --> 00:11:43.70 So there still is a variance.
00:11:43.70 --> 00:11:48.02 And when we looked at good squadrons or bad squadrons, however you wanted to define that,
00:11:48.02 --> 00:11:50.46 a lot of times it was kind of just a feeling.
00:11:50.46 --> 00:11:54.82 Almost like an intangible quality of that's a good squadron and that's a bad squadron.
00:11:54.82 --> 00:11:58.18 And the way we judge that was how did there people acted?
00:11:58.18 --> 00:11:59.98 And other people acted?
00:11:59.98 --> 00:12:02.94 A reflection of their leadership puts exactly what he just said.
00:12:02.94 --> 00:12:07.74 And the squadrons would take on the persona and the personality of their leaders and the
00:12:07.74 --> 00:12:10.10 good leaders had good squadrons.
00:12:10.10 --> 00:12:15.46 And the bad leaders, or the leaders that weren't as good, their squadrons reflected that.
00:12:15.46 --> 00:12:17.34 So you got 12 aircraft.
00:12:17.34 --> 00:12:22.10 And then are those aircraft broken up into sections or platoon somehow?
00:12:22.10 --> 00:12:24.14 Or is it just every man for himself?
00:12:24.14 --> 00:12:27.30 No, I mean, they had 12 aircraft that didn't theory were all the same.
00:12:27.30 --> 00:12:28.86 You know, they weren't all fliable at a time.
00:12:28.86 --> 00:12:30.82 But no, we wouldn't break them down.
00:12:30.82 --> 00:12:34.90 We would fly an element sometimes at two or a four ship, but the aircraft were just rotated
00:12:34.90 --> 00:12:37.74 through so you could be in any given aircraft on any day.
00:12:37.74 --> 00:12:44.50 So in a seal platoon, you could have a great officer.
00:12:44.50 --> 00:12:45.66 And you could have a great platoon.
00:12:45.66 --> 00:12:53.66 You could also have a great platoon chief or a great leading pettioser or a system platoon commander
00:12:53.66 --> 00:12:56.02 chances are you're not going to get a pipe hitting system.
00:12:56.02 --> 00:12:59.06 So you can get some really solid guys, but they just don't have to experience it.
00:12:59.06 --> 00:13:06.26 So basically what you needed was ah, ah, singular, really good leader.
00:13:06.26 --> 00:13:11.02 Didn't necessarily need to be the top guy, but somebody, you know, at a seal team, you
00:13:11.02 --> 00:13:14.22 might have a great seal team commanding officer.
00:13:14.22 --> 00:13:17.58 You also might have, and that could really make the whole seal team great.
00:13:17.58 --> 00:13:23.78 You could also have a great seal team command master chief who is a kickass guy.
00:13:23.78 --> 00:13:27.38 You could have a great seal, uh, ops master chief.
00:13:27.38 --> 00:13:35.50 So as long as you had one of these guys in the team that was legit badass, you could
00:13:35.50 --> 00:13:36.94 you're going to pull it off.
00:13:36.94 --> 00:13:38.66 Unless you get somebody that's an idiot in there too.
00:13:38.66 --> 00:13:42.46 If you get somebody with a big ego, you know, the command master chief has a big
00:13:42.46 --> 00:13:46.26 ego or the commanding officer has a big ego and also you got conflict, then you know, all
00:13:46.26 --> 00:13:48.70 bets are off and we got man.
00:13:48.70 --> 00:13:53.78 But chances are if you got one good leader, you're going to, you're going to, the, the, the
00:13:53.78 --> 00:13:55.90 group will take on the personality of the commander.
00:13:55.90 --> 00:13:59.30 So if you don't like the personality of your team, guess what?
00:13:59.30 --> 00:14:01.66 Ha, go look in the mirror.
00:14:01.66 --> 00:14:06.58 Next, counseling of individuals at the company level, the commander and the champion of
00:14:06.58 --> 00:14:12.58 the ones to whom the men will come for guidance when they have to, when they have or think
00:14:12.58 --> 00:14:14.34 they have problems.
00:14:14.34 --> 00:14:20.86 Discamanders are usually surprised, the number of men who actually have real personal difficulties.
00:14:20.86 --> 00:14:25.62 These may take a variety of forms, money troubles, family difficulties, disciplinary problems,
00:14:25.62 --> 00:14:28.14 character weaknesses and spiritual conflicts.
00:14:28.14 --> 00:14:30.06 The commander's problem is too old.
00:14:30.06 --> 00:14:34.74 First, he must train himself to recognize and to look for the early signs that identify
00:14:34.74 --> 00:14:36.78 a man with problems.
00:14:36.78 --> 00:14:42.74 Early recognition of a problem, like timely diagnosis of a disease makes the treatment and
00:14:42.74 --> 00:14:45.34 cure easier.
00:14:45.34 --> 00:14:51.42 Second, having identified the problem, the commander must take the proper steps to correct it,
00:14:51.42 --> 00:14:54.54 often his own counseling will have to be sufficient.
00:14:54.54 --> 00:14:57.18 But in other cases, he left a call on others for help.
00:14:57.18 --> 00:15:00.18 Here is the central that the correct source be used.
00:15:00.18 --> 00:15:05.06 That the man who's pay record is incorrect, shouldn't be sent to the chaplain, but to
00:15:05.06 --> 00:15:06.06 the finance clerk.
00:15:06.06 --> 00:15:07.06 All right.
00:15:07.06 --> 00:15:10.10 So we're, we're, we're making sure that we identify problems.
00:15:10.10 --> 00:15:12.86 We have to look for that.
00:15:12.86 --> 00:15:16.18 This has always been a problem for me because no one ever tells me anything when something's
00:15:16.18 --> 00:15:18.18 going wrong.
00:15:18.18 --> 00:15:23.34 No one wants to tell me that they're overworked or they don't want to do another operation
00:15:23.34 --> 00:15:24.34 or whatever.
00:15:24.34 --> 00:15:25.50 No one ever wants to tell me that.
00:15:25.50 --> 00:15:27.34 So I have to drag it out of people.
00:15:27.34 --> 00:15:31.30 I have to have intel sources that will tell me that the troops are getting tired or the
00:15:31.30 --> 00:15:35.06 guys are worn out or whatever.
00:15:35.06 --> 00:15:36.54 Recognition of outstanding work.
00:15:36.54 --> 00:15:38.26 This is the next section.
00:15:38.26 --> 00:15:42.26 Make sure way to instill loyal to you to recognize outstanding work from your subordinates.
00:15:42.26 --> 00:15:49.70 Satisfaction in a job well done as a trait of all men and recognition by others of the same
00:15:49.70 --> 00:15:55.30 good work will appeal to the vanity that lies in all of us.
00:15:55.30 --> 00:15:58.06 Another thing I'm bad at.
00:15:58.06 --> 00:16:01.54 I'm horrible at recognizing people for good work.
00:16:01.54 --> 00:16:08.18 I just think everyone's doing what they should be doing and it's very seldom that I
00:16:08.18 --> 00:16:12.14 take the time to like think somebody I usually have to think about it.
00:16:12.14 --> 00:16:14.50 I'm horrible at that.
00:16:14.50 --> 00:16:19.70 Life has told me though that when I would say something that someone did good they'd
00:16:19.70 --> 00:16:24.58 be super stoked that if we go would be fired up.
00:16:24.58 --> 00:16:25.58 Recognition can take many forms.
00:16:25.58 --> 00:16:29.10 Decorations letters of commendation or a acknowledgement of formation or the issuance
00:16:29.10 --> 00:16:34.18 of a three day pass but whatever the form is essential that the commander is a commander
00:16:34.18 --> 00:16:38.54 be alert to outstanding performance and give timely public recognition when it is due.
00:16:38.54 --> 00:16:41.46 Can I just what about just a simple head nod?
00:16:41.46 --> 00:16:42.46 Is that work?
00:16:42.46 --> 00:16:43.46 Yeah that can work man.
00:16:43.46 --> 00:16:48.34 I mean part of that is you got to pay attention to what matters to your people and you know
00:16:48.34 --> 00:16:50.74 the thing that I always craved the most the recognition.
00:16:50.74 --> 00:16:51.74 I didn't.
00:16:51.74 --> 00:16:57.94 The recognition I wanted was to be left alone and if my leadership didn't when my leadership
00:16:57.94 --> 00:17:02.34 wasn't micromanaging me and giving me the flexibility that that was him okay I must be
00:17:02.34 --> 00:17:03.86 doing something right.
00:17:03.86 --> 00:17:08.82 Cool we're good but there's nothing wrong with the recognition.
00:17:08.82 --> 00:17:12.66 I'm not trying to pile on the idea of like don't acknowledge your people's good work but
00:17:12.66 --> 00:17:16.86 what matters to somebody doesn't always matter to everybody and you got to actually pay
00:17:16.86 --> 00:17:22.74 attention what matters and over time the the head nod and keep doing what you're doing
00:17:22.74 --> 00:17:24.10 dude that's good to go.
00:17:24.10 --> 00:17:30.74 Yeah you know I had trouble with this because and I still do because you know when
00:17:30.74 --> 00:17:38.66 you're the boss right well in my mind you know if I say hey Dave good job I just I think
00:17:38.66 --> 00:17:42.50 you don't care about that because I'm just some other guy that's trying to work hard whatever
00:17:42.50 --> 00:17:48.42 and I remember I've told the story before I was first got to Ramadi needed a certain type
00:17:48.42 --> 00:17:55.10 of laptop computer for my office and the radio guy the IT guy the radio man guy who's
00:17:55.10 --> 00:17:59.50 a great dude I told him hey I need to have I need to have a zipper and a nipper laptop
00:17:59.50 --> 00:18:03.58 side by side and he's okay we don't really have enough nipper these are I need a classified
00:18:03.58 --> 00:18:09.26 computer and an unclassified computer side by side so that when I was working I could if I
00:18:09.26 --> 00:18:14.22 needed some information that was from the unclassified side I could look it up if and and
00:18:14.22 --> 00:18:17.10 then continue to work on whatever else working on.
00:18:17.10 --> 00:18:23.34 So I remember I said hey I called him into the tech operations and I said hey I want a
00:18:23.34 --> 00:18:26.70 classified computer here and an unclassified computer here and he goes well we don't really
00:18:26.70 --> 00:18:32.54 have enough unclassified computers and I kind of went okay and then a few minutes later I
00:18:32.54 --> 00:18:38.94 walked through the the chow haul and we had set up this unclassified computer station with
00:18:38.94 --> 00:18:43.98 six computers for everyone to use now everyone had computers in their tent too this wasn't
00:18:43.98 --> 00:18:49.02 like you know everyone was lined up to use these six computers no it was just somebody decided
00:18:49.02 --> 00:18:52.62 hey we'll put some internet computers out here and so I walked out there said wait a second
00:18:52.62 --> 00:18:56.30 we have all these unclassified computers right here and I went back and said hey man those
00:18:56.30 --> 00:19:00.86 computers that other get one to me and he was like oh Roger that and I realized oh I need to
00:19:00.86 --> 00:19:08.46 make the call on that and what I say has impact you know and so when you say something negative
00:19:08.46 --> 00:19:11.90 it has a big impact because you know sometimes I say that that plan doesn't make any sense
00:19:11.90 --> 00:19:15.58 and everyone just be well be quiet because they think that you don't like the plan
00:19:15.98 --> 00:19:20.62 when reality is you're just thinking maybe I could come up with a different plan so you got
00:19:20.62 --> 00:19:25.58 the overall and I wrote about this in leadership strategy tactics your words have power and
00:19:25.58 --> 00:19:31.10 impact so remembering that when you give someone some compliments it may have some it has as
00:19:31.10 --> 00:19:40.94 more significance than you might think efficiency reports I was I was thinking myself when I saw
00:19:40.94 --> 00:19:43.90 this I was like I you know I'll kind of skip over this who cares you know no one wants to hear
00:19:43.90 --> 00:19:51.34 about efficiency reports then I read it nice it oh I will absolutely include this with the
00:19:51.34 --> 00:19:57.42 advent of enlisted efficiency reports the command so efficiency reports so for in the civilian
00:19:57.42 --> 00:20:01.66 sector with the suit boiled down to you know unvaluations are performance evaluation for someone
00:20:03.02 --> 00:20:08.30 the commander now has a new tool which will assist him in gaining the desired motivation from
00:20:08.30 --> 00:20:15.18 his key enlisted personnel too often the efficiency report becomes the padlock on the barn door
00:20:15.18 --> 00:20:23.10 after the horse has been stolen what a great way to think about wasting some kind of evaluation
00:20:23.10 --> 00:20:28.06 format performance evaluation hey Dave you went and did something for a year you did your job
00:20:28.06 --> 00:20:33.02 and then you show up after a year and I say yeah you didn't do that great of a job woo what good is that
00:20:33.74 --> 00:20:39.50 the barn are the there were started got stolen I have found that unacceptable performance
00:20:39.50 --> 00:20:44.86 and the resultant bad efficiency reports can often be reduced to a minimum through early
00:20:44.86 --> 00:20:53.26 effective observation and counseling G what a novel idea when Dave starts screwing up don't wait
00:20:53.26 --> 00:20:57.98 six months to give the efficiency report say hey Dave it's been three weeks you've been on this
00:20:57.98 --> 00:21:04.86 project I already see that you're heading the wrong direction let's talk if a commander makes it a
00:21:04.86 --> 00:21:11.66 practice to observe his men closely and call them in periodically for an evaluation of their
00:21:11.66 --> 00:21:16.38 performance in terms of strengths and weaknesses he can often correct deficiencies without it
00:21:16.38 --> 00:21:26.38 becoming necessary to issue an unsatisfactory efficiency report boom it's a tool that you've got
00:21:26.38 --> 00:21:36.14 that you can use a three part program of and here's the three parts observation and evaluation
00:21:36.14 --> 00:21:41.42 counseling and guidance of the individual and individual and then further observation to determine
00:21:41.42 --> 00:21:46.86 the response to the counseling is your key to effective use of the efficiency report then it
00:21:46.86 --> 00:21:54.94 becomes a tool for improvement rather than merely a reward or punishment for past performance wow
00:21:56.14 --> 00:22:01.90 wow imagine that and it's unsap because in the navy you get an evaluation or a fitness report
00:22:01.90 --> 00:22:07.74 once a year and there's a lot of companies that we work with that do something similar there's
00:22:08.78 --> 00:22:14.38 that's just not often it's not often enough it's not even close and those periodic
00:22:15.82 --> 00:22:20.46 evaluations they actually don't even need to be that formal it's really just the core of building
00:22:20.46 --> 00:22:24.86 relationships is getting to know your people by being out with them the best thing you can do is
00:22:24.86 --> 00:22:29.34 know your people well enough to be able to recognize when they're going in the wrong direction
00:22:29.34 --> 00:22:33.02 and if you talk to your people once a year you're not going to know that because you don't even know
00:22:33.02 --> 00:22:37.90 what their typically like and so if I'm working with you and and I know Jaco pretty well and all
00:22:37.90 --> 00:22:42.62 of a sudden Jaco shows up one day and he's not Jaco I can get involved right then but the only way
00:22:42.62 --> 00:22:48.06 for me to tell that you're not yourself or not doing the things that I'm used to is I got to be
00:22:48.06 --> 00:22:51.66 around you just a little bit more and you don't need to track all this stuff every single time you don't
00:22:51.66 --> 00:22:57.10 need to know the formal piece of it and formal counseling is important but the best tool you've
00:22:57.10 --> 00:23:01.82 got is actually know them well enough to go something's not right and if you can intercept that
00:23:01.82 --> 00:23:08.94 on day one rather than day 30 or 60 or 90 not only do you actually help solve that problem that
00:23:08.94 --> 00:23:14.62 other person recognizes that you know and care about them enough to get involved and being able to
00:23:14.62 --> 00:23:19.18 do that is really a function of your time more than anything else of being around your people to
00:23:19.18 --> 00:23:24.62 know them well enough to identify that when they're off the path so it comes down as high
00:23:24.62 --> 00:23:31.18 management when I talk about planning and I say okay if I give Dave a mission tasking and say okay
00:23:31.18 --> 00:23:37.26 Dave come up with a plan and how you want to do this if I leave for 12 hours and you were 3
00:23:37.26 --> 00:23:40.86 degrees off and you're what you thought you should do versus what I thought you should do I come
00:23:40.86 --> 00:23:44.94 back 12 hours there's 12 hours of wasted time because you've been going on on the wrong direction
00:23:44.94 --> 00:23:49.50 and now you're way off course if I go hey Dave here's the here's the mission you need to
00:23:49.50 --> 00:23:53.98 execute here's the task come up with your you know some connoffs I'll be back in a half an hour
00:23:54.70 --> 00:24:00.06 your 3 degrees off it oh I barely even takes a nudge to get you right back on track and we're we're
00:24:00.06 --> 00:24:09.18 tracking so the earlier you give people corrective measures the the the minimum the the the limit
00:24:09.18 --> 00:24:14.86 of what you have to do to get them back on course is is totally limited it's the minimum
00:24:14.86 --> 00:24:21.50 workforce required so if you and I if I said hey Dave here's a mission tasking come up with how
00:24:21.50 --> 00:24:25.98 you want to do I'll be back in half an hour when I came back in a half an hour and you're 3 degrees
00:24:25.98 --> 00:24:31.58 off course I barely I probably would be able to get you back on course by asking you will
00:24:31.58 --> 00:24:35.66 not even tell me anything just by saying hey what do you think about what do you think about
00:24:35.66 --> 00:24:38.62 this area up to the north do you think that's a you think there could be enemy up there
00:24:39.50 --> 00:24:42.78 that's kind of what the intel says right and you say yeah and I'd say oh
00:24:42.78 --> 00:24:47.34 are you gonna put a blocking force up there you didn't have a blocking force in your plan
00:24:47.34 --> 00:24:52.62 you go yes absolutely and cool now we're totally square yeah if I walk away for 12 hours
00:24:52.62 --> 00:24:57.42 and let you come up with a plan you're wide open to the enemy attack from the north you have
00:24:57.42 --> 00:25:01.82 you use your blocking force in a totally different area you don't even have enough people now
00:25:01.82 --> 00:25:06.14 because you so it's just it's totally wrong and now we got to come in with blunt force trauma
00:25:06.14 --> 00:25:09.82 and now it's not your planning anymore you've given up on a ship it's just it's just a nightmare
00:25:09.82 --> 00:25:15.10 it's crazy so the earlier I get involved the less force I have to use and my goal is the
00:25:15.10 --> 00:25:19.74 leaders to use the minimum force required and the longer I wait to use force but worse it's
00:25:19.74 --> 00:25:27.34 gonna be and if you're out there thinking about the time the the daunting task of spending
00:25:27.34 --> 00:25:34.54 all that time up front the ROI on your investment of time of front is is it's it's unlimited
00:25:34.54 --> 00:25:40.22 because if you make that investment up front which seems like a lot of time what you save on the back
00:25:40.22 --> 00:25:45.82 end of that so from the time manager standpoint yes yes it is an additional investment of a
00:25:45.82 --> 00:25:49.50 little bit of time upfront it is and you got to account for that time that is not free time
00:25:49.50 --> 00:25:56.38 but what you save from that ROI all day all day it's not even close and you know what is funny
00:25:56.38 --> 00:26:00.54 is you you're I disagree with you because you say it's this big investment up front it's not
00:26:00.54 --> 00:26:04.46 so low investment up front it's me going hey Dave how are you gonna execute this and you go
00:26:04.46 --> 00:26:07.26 all my do it like this and I go oh don't forget there's enemy up there you are I'm gonna put
00:26:07.26 --> 00:26:11.90 a blocking for sure okay cool there we go that's how that was it that took 18s that's the story we tell
00:26:11.90 --> 00:26:16.06 ourselves like hey I can't come back in 30 minutes because you actually can't you're absolutely right
00:26:16.06 --> 00:26:21.82 and it's the idea of whatever it seems like I don't have time a you do have time and if you do
00:26:21.82 --> 00:26:27.34 need to do some mental calculation of that time the ROI in that time is well worth whatever
00:26:27.34 --> 00:26:33.90 you might miss for that five minute check-in that happens up front and it also shows another person oh
00:26:33.90 --> 00:26:38.46 joccal care joccal is in the game joccal is paying attention I wonder if that means I'm gonna be more
00:26:38.46 --> 00:26:43.02 or less interested in giving you a really good plan if I know you care about it you know it's
00:26:43.02 --> 00:26:53.82 interesting too ROI the ROI on time is that it doesn't even make sense and I'll tell you why
00:26:53.82 --> 00:26:58.86 because I don't get that time back if you're supposed to execute a mission tonight and I give you
00:26:58.86 --> 00:27:04.94 12 hours to plan and I go hey here's the mission you got to execute and I don't come back and check in
00:27:04.94 --> 00:27:10.14 by the time 12 hours go by and I realize that your plan is a total disaster it's not that the ROI
00:27:10.70 --> 00:27:16.70 it's not I don't get return on my investment it's that we it's that it's it's bankrupt so it's total failure
00:27:17.34 --> 00:27:22.94 it's total in complete failure I can't even get it back the ROI is negative it's it's horrible
00:27:22.94 --> 00:27:30.38 where as a little investment upfront total gain changer totally now here's another section I wasn't
00:27:30.38 --> 00:27:36.22 gonna read and I remember I I sent you a picture of this book or sections of the book and you you said
00:27:36.22 --> 00:27:40.54 just read the whole just you're gonna just cover the whole thing yeah and I was kind of like yeah you
00:27:40.54 --> 00:27:44.86 know that's cool I'm sure I'll cover a lot of it but you know I'm always I don't want to waste people's
00:27:44.86 --> 00:27:48.78 time so I'm looking for okay what can we streamline a little bit so there's this section called
00:27:48.78 --> 00:27:53.66 promotion then look if you're in the civilian world how much do you care about how they advance
00:27:53.66 --> 00:28:00.54 people in the army in 1952 right whatever and then I read it a little bit okay well looks like we're
00:28:00.54 --> 00:28:05.02 covering this too and I'll tell you how it a second so it says promotion the promotion policy of a
00:28:05.02 --> 00:28:10.94 commanders of a command has a strong bearing on morale and overall efficiency it must be fair
00:28:11.74 --> 00:28:16.30 and by the way this is one thing that you're gonna start to pick up in this section of the book
00:28:16.30 --> 00:28:23.82 and in some of the other sections there is absolutely part of general clerk that is looking to get promoted
00:28:24.70 --> 00:28:29.26 and he you can feel it and there's gonna be other places where you feel it and what's cool is
00:28:29.98 --> 00:28:37.10 you'll feel it and he'll say it and then a little later on he'll he'll hint that you know what that
00:28:37.10 --> 00:28:41.02 doesn't really even matter so we're gonna go back and forth we're gonna come up with some of these
00:28:41.02 --> 00:28:48.94 things where you say okay he's a he's a guy that really cares that's in the game just to get promoted
00:28:48.94 --> 00:28:55.66 right which I am not a big proponent of hey your main reason to be in the game is get promoted that being said
00:28:56.70 --> 00:29:03.18 if I have got a team and I want to take care of my team well how do I how do I do the best job
00:29:03.18 --> 00:29:07.98 take my care of my team I get promoted so I have more leverage and more power and I can be positive
00:29:07.98 --> 00:29:13.26 influence on even more people so getting promoted if you're getting promoted for yourself
00:29:14.14 --> 00:29:20.06 we don't like that and by the way when I say we I'm talking about the people that work for you
00:29:20.06 --> 00:29:25.58 if you're getting promoted for yourself they don't like it we don't like that but if you're
00:29:25.58 --> 00:29:31.42 getting promoted so that you can help the team achieve their mission protect the team take care of
00:29:31.42 --> 00:29:37.26 the team grow the team influence the team in a positive way if that's why you're getting promoted
00:29:37.26 --> 00:29:44.54 cool good on you good we we like that you're doing it for the right reasons and if you think if you
00:29:44.54 --> 00:29:49.34 think if you think you can sneak around and get promoted for yourself but you don't really be
00:29:49.34 --> 00:29:58.22 to I promise in you I promise you everybody sees it so promotion it must be fair
00:29:58.86 --> 00:30:03.82 buy it the commander can encourage men to develop themselves for permissions for positions of
00:30:03.82 --> 00:30:10.22 supervision and leadership the commander should consider the following qualifications and attributes
00:30:10.22 --> 00:30:15.42 when considering a man for promotion so he goes into a list and what I did and what I wrote down here
00:30:15.42 --> 00:30:25.02 was when I go through this list aim the aim this list at yourself you aim this list at yourself
00:30:25.02 --> 00:30:44.46 are you promoteable number one reliability number one reliability when when I talk about relationships
00:30:44.46 --> 00:30:52.30 I use the word relationships I'm really talking about trust and trust if you don't have trust
00:30:52.30 --> 00:30:59.66 inside of a team all those lost well yeah so the question is how do you build trust well let me
00:30:59.66 --> 00:31:05.90 give you a good hint the number one clue right here be reliable be reliable okay so that's number one
00:31:05.90 --> 00:31:12.14 number two his knowledge of his present job and his preparation for the next higher one so be
00:31:12.14 --> 00:31:17.90 knowledgeable proficiency text test scores leadership can he direct men
00:31:17.90 --> 00:31:25.66 ability to organize and manage a job okay these are all things if you aim these things at
00:31:25.66 --> 00:31:34.78 yourself it is a powerful thing to think about knowledge to detect and courage to correct errors
00:31:34.78 --> 00:31:43.66 in subordinates initiative does he perform well without close supervision appearance military
00:31:43.66 --> 00:31:49.42 courtesy and neatness this makes me happy that I wrote the warrior kid books
00:31:52.30 --> 00:31:57.82 maintenance of equipment individual and organizational attitude loyalty enthusiasm
00:31:57.82 --> 00:32:04.54 ability as an instructor ability as an instructor and I'll tell you what I've been thinking
00:32:04.54 --> 00:32:09.98 about and there's a couple of the things that we'll clue in on this we've been talking we've been
00:32:09.98 --> 00:32:17.26 developing leadership certification program at echelom front and one of the things that we've been
00:32:17.26 --> 00:32:26.86 dancing around is the fact that there's there's maybe well we we were dancing around with like
00:32:26.86 --> 00:32:30.78 two different pipelines like you're either a trainer that's going to train people how to lead
00:32:30.78 --> 00:32:34.14 or your leader and you're in a supervisor position and your management position and your leader
00:32:34.14 --> 00:32:40.86 and then we've kind of got into a point where we say listen these are the same thing and in
00:32:40.86 --> 00:32:47.34 order to become a good leader you have to be able to teach you have to be able to show people how to
00:32:47.34 --> 00:32:54.54 do things so it's interesting that he's got ability as an instructor because listen if I'm going
00:32:54.54 --> 00:32:59.42 to promote you Dave from you know from being in charge of a squad to being in charge of a tune
00:32:59.42 --> 00:33:04.78 I want you to be able to teach I want you to be able to instruct that is absolutely important
00:33:04.78 --> 00:33:09.26 and and in a leadership environment i want you to be able to teach the team about leadership.
00:33:09.26 --> 00:33:13.66 I want you to be able to teach when I put you in charge of a tune I want you to be able to teach
00:33:13.66 --> 00:33:19.02 your squad leaders how to lead. I want you to be able to teach your fire team leaders how to lead
00:33:19.02 --> 00:33:24.86 and I also want you to be able to teach them how to break down a 240g. I want you to be able
00:33:24.86 --> 00:33:29.34 to teach us gesagt so the ability to be an instructor is important and it's equally important
00:33:29.34 --> 00:33:32.08 because when we teach, we learn.
00:33:32.08 --> 00:33:33.92 Yeah.
00:33:33.92 --> 00:33:39.38 That second point was what I was thinking in my head a lot is, you know, top gun for
00:33:39.38 --> 00:33:42.48 my community is kind of the apex of instruction.
00:33:42.48 --> 00:33:48.12 You know, the quality of instruction is is kind of at its peak there because you
00:33:48.12 --> 00:33:49.40 get to focus just on that.
00:33:49.40 --> 00:33:52.20 You don't have all these other distractions going on so you focus on that.
00:33:52.20 --> 00:33:55.80 I learned more there than I did anywhere else.
00:33:55.80 --> 00:34:02.000 And the ability to teach is really comes from how much you truly understand something.
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.20 And for me, being able to fly an airplane or run the radar or manage the systems, a lot
00:34:07.20 --> 00:34:09.04 of people can do that.
00:34:09.04 --> 00:34:15.60 But when you try to teach something, it exposes your gaps in knowledge.
00:34:15.60 --> 00:34:19.56 And a good teacher, when they break down what they're going to teach, they recognize,
00:34:19.56 --> 00:34:22.28 oh, I don't actually understand this very well.
00:34:22.28 --> 00:34:25.76 So before I teach it to you, I get to go learn about this more.
00:34:25.76 --> 00:34:31.24 So the learning connected to the teaching, I learned more because my obligation was to teach
00:34:31.24 --> 00:34:32.24 it.
00:34:32.24 --> 00:34:35.36 And as I'm learning to teach, expose all the things I didn't know.
00:34:35.36 --> 00:34:39.40 So a good teacher actually has to understand it better than anybody else.
00:34:39.40 --> 00:34:41.92 And that connection between those two is so critical.
00:34:41.92 --> 00:34:47.24 And the idea of teaching is I think a reflection or anything of how well you truly know
00:34:47.24 --> 00:34:48.24 something.
00:34:48.24 --> 00:34:51.12 And you don't really test yourself and how well you know it until you have to explain
00:34:51.12 --> 00:34:52.68 it to somebody else.
00:34:52.68 --> 00:34:53.68 Yeah.
00:34:53.68 --> 00:34:58.60 So I started, I just wrote down, you know, I hope he's about to say that as you teach
00:34:58.60 --> 00:34:59.60 you learn.
00:34:59.60 --> 00:35:01.60 And that's exactly what you said.
00:35:01.60 --> 00:35:05.60 You identify the gaps in your own knowledge and you go, okay, better figure this out.
00:35:05.60 --> 00:35:06.60 A better go run the stroke.
00:35:06.60 --> 00:35:10.20 I better pull the thread on that until I understand it better.
00:35:10.20 --> 00:35:15.04 Next participation in unit and community activities does he use his time off to improve
00:35:15.04 --> 00:35:18.68 himself.
00:35:18.68 --> 00:35:21.68 Aim that one at yourself.
00:35:21.68 --> 00:35:25.68 Is he a good soldier all the time?
00:35:25.68 --> 00:35:31.04 Is the job he has charged with being done better now than it was when he took over?
00:35:31.04 --> 00:35:38.16 Judgment in common sense, a good scale of values, ability to receive and carry out instructions
00:35:38.16 --> 00:35:44.24 has he been efficiently filling his grade position, accident record, incident record,
00:35:44.24 --> 00:35:49.20 a wall in article 15, which means it has the dude gotten in trouble before.
00:35:49.20 --> 00:35:52.20 Really powerful list, there may be other considerations.
00:35:52.20 --> 00:35:57.24 They should add up to confidence that the man will play as part well under any conditions
00:35:57.24 --> 00:36:04.000 especially in unusual situations.
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.32 What's interesting about that?
00:36:05.32 --> 00:36:12.16 Why does that make me think awesome thoughts?
00:36:12.16 --> 00:36:18.16 Because what that says is that this military guy who believes in discipline and believes
00:36:18.16 --> 00:36:23.96 in being able to do your job and being able to receive and carry out instructions, that's
00:36:23.96 --> 00:36:25.44 what he said.
00:36:25.44 --> 00:36:30.88 He wants you to be especially able to perform in unusual situations.
00:36:30.88 --> 00:36:35.68 How do you get good at performing on unusual situations?
00:36:35.68 --> 00:36:42.32 You get tested, you get tasked, you get things thrown at you and you have to use your mind.
00:36:42.32 --> 00:36:45.60 It's great that you have the ability to receive and carry out instructions.
00:36:45.60 --> 00:36:46.60 This is my point.
00:36:46.60 --> 00:36:50.04 Think that you have the ability to receive and carry out instructions.
00:36:50.04 --> 00:36:51.88 That's great.
00:36:51.88 --> 00:36:55.48 But if I throw something in usual at you and what you have to do is figure it out and you
00:36:55.48 --> 00:37:01.32 don't know how to do that, we got it all proble.
00:37:01.32 --> 00:37:05.44 Unless you want him as a member of your team do not promote him or recommend him for
00:37:05.44 --> 00:37:06.44 promotion.
00:37:06.44 --> 00:37:12.52 The promotion policy of a unit commander should be published and understood by all.
00:37:12.52 --> 00:37:17.60 Then it goes through this next section, elimination of ineffective personnel.
00:37:17.60 --> 00:37:21.96 Like automatorship, when the higher one the fire, when a mentor will wind the fire.
00:37:21.96 --> 00:37:27.08 It is the commander's duty to contribute to raising the standards of the United States
00:37:27.08 --> 00:37:28.88 Army.
00:37:28.88 --> 00:37:31.28 What a beast statement that is.
00:37:31.28 --> 00:37:36.04 It is that commander's duty to contribute to raising the standards of the United States
00:37:36.04 --> 00:37:38.08 Army.
00:37:38.08 --> 00:37:43.16 I want to approach this goal is a continuous evaluation of his personnel.
00:37:43.16 --> 00:37:46.12 Officers, non-commission officers and enlisted men like.
00:37:46.12 --> 00:37:52.64 When ineptness is revealed or continuing ineffectiveness is detected in officers and non-commission
00:37:52.64 --> 00:38:00.08 officers, it is the commander's duty to see that corrective measures are taken elimination
00:38:00.08 --> 00:38:04.44 or reduction in grade as appropriate.
00:38:04.44 --> 00:38:09.000 So you have done your escalation of counseling, I have done everything I can to achieve
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.72 if I can straighten Dave Burke out, he can't make it happen.
00:38:12.72 --> 00:38:18.16 Dave Burke needs to go bye-bye.
00:38:18.16 --> 00:38:23.44 The importance of a good but fair reduction policy is often overlooked.
00:38:23.44 --> 00:38:28.88 Few things disrupt the unit more than the presence of inefficient leaders.
00:38:28.88 --> 00:38:33.08 G.
00:38:33.08 --> 00:38:34.88 That comes as a big shock.
00:38:34.88 --> 00:38:37.92 Few things disrupt the unit more than the presence of inefficient leaders.
00:38:37.92 --> 00:38:39.40 So let's think about this.
00:38:39.40 --> 00:38:43.96 If Dave's working for me and Dave is inefficient and Dave doesn't do a good job and Dave
00:38:43.96 --> 00:38:49.80 drops the ball and Dave's working for me and I continue to allow Dave to be there.
00:38:49.80 --> 00:38:50.80 What does the team think of him?
00:38:50.80 --> 00:38:52.64 What does it say about you as a leader?
00:38:52.64 --> 00:38:55.40 It says I suck as a leader.
00:38:55.40 --> 00:38:56.60 That's what it says.
00:38:56.60 --> 00:39:01.72 Or it says that you don't actually care because this leader this day that's underperforming,
00:39:01.72 --> 00:39:03.000 who is he actually affecting?
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.24 He's affecting the whole team and you know, a synonym for that reduction rank is that's
00:39:09.24 --> 00:39:11.16 rank is essentially responsibility.
00:39:11.16 --> 00:39:14.000 So as your rank grows in the military, you know, responsibility grows.
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.96 So you don't have to have a ranking structure in your organization.
00:39:16.96 --> 00:39:21.36 You've got responsibility for, you know, this guy is a team leader or supervisor or impact
00:39:21.36 --> 00:39:22.36 the team.
00:39:22.36 --> 00:39:24.44 This guy's underperformance that you tolerate.
00:39:24.44 --> 00:39:25.88 Doesn't just affect this underperformance.
00:39:25.88 --> 00:39:30.24 It's all the people in his influence and they're looking at you saying this is what
00:39:30.24 --> 00:39:33.84 Jocca was going to put up with this is the bar that he's going to tolerate and he'll
00:39:33.84 --> 00:39:39.92 by the way, this affects me personally and just like on the other extreme of getting rid
00:39:39.92 --> 00:39:44.52 of people way too soon, way too premature that you haven't invested in, keeping the wrong
00:39:44.52 --> 00:39:54.96 people around in terms of what that does to your leadership capital.
00:39:54.96 --> 00:39:58.96 Regulations provide for the reduction of enlisted men and the separation of officers
00:39:58.96 --> 00:40:04.000 for an inefficiency and actual performance of their job or as a result of misconduct.
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.28 The latter is where where we fall most often.
00:40:08.28 --> 00:40:11.44 We fail, or sorry, the latter is where we fail most often.
00:40:11.44 --> 00:40:17.92 We fail because we do not face up to the fact that key personnel to be good leaders of
00:40:17.92 --> 00:40:23.36 young men must also have good character.
00:40:23.36 --> 00:40:29.68 More character will inevitably manifest itself in poor conduct, leaders influence the actions
00:40:29.68 --> 00:40:31.80 of their subordinates.
00:40:31.80 --> 00:40:37.12 Most leaders are considered by those of less rank as highly qualified and competent.
00:40:37.12 --> 00:40:42.20 Therefore, when poor conduct is manifested off duty by anyone in leadership capacity, it
00:40:42.20 --> 00:40:46.08 has a detrimental effect on the entire unit.
00:40:46.08 --> 00:40:51.76 Especially dangerous in this regard are those key personnel who are outstanding in their
00:40:51.76 --> 00:40:53.16 work.
00:40:53.16 --> 00:40:59.16 Or their influence is even greater on troops who, observing them, will often emulate their
00:40:59.16 --> 00:41:02.68 actions even to the point of delinquency.
00:41:02.68 --> 00:41:07.52 If this condition persists, it can lead to a broken breakdown of discipline throughout
00:41:07.52 --> 00:41:10.92 the unit in an incredibly short time.
00:41:10.92 --> 00:41:16.92 Leaders with character deficiencies, regardless of how good they might appear in field training,
00:41:16.92 --> 00:41:23.12 or a luxury we cannot afford.
00:41:23.12 --> 00:41:24.12 Would you write down?
00:41:24.12 --> 00:41:30.04 I wrote down character and conduct.
00:41:30.04 --> 00:41:36.20 I was thinking as you are reading this, you cannot, and I learned this in the Marine Corps.
00:41:36.20 --> 00:41:40.88 You cannot separate your work life from some other part of your life.
00:41:40.88 --> 00:41:46.12 If you were a leader, you are committed to being a leader all the time.
00:41:46.12 --> 00:41:53.60 Where you are scrutinized, the most risk is how you act off the clock, if you want to call
00:41:53.60 --> 00:41:54.60 that.
00:41:54.60 --> 00:41:58.68 I can stand up in front of my Marines and tell them all the things I expect from them.
00:41:58.68 --> 00:42:01.44 Whatever those might be, I can make a list that are all good and I could behave like that
00:42:01.44 --> 00:42:02.44 at work.
00:42:02.44 --> 00:42:07.52 If I go out and down or back in my personal life, anywhere else outside of work, and I reveal
00:42:07.52 --> 00:42:10.16 that I don't live by the expectations I set for my people.
00:42:10.16 --> 00:42:14.92 My character is revealed that I don't actually apply those to myself.
00:42:14.92 --> 00:42:19.48 The degree to which that undermines me as a leader at work is actually much worse than
00:42:19.48 --> 00:42:23.32 if I just wasn't great at work and I'm just working on it and trying to get better.
00:42:23.32 --> 00:42:30.12 Your character, your character, sooner or later, is going to be revealed.
00:42:30.12 --> 00:42:32.60 Because you're going to find yourself in a place where you think nobody is looking,
00:42:32.60 --> 00:42:36.52 you're going to find yourself in an environment where you think it's okay and who you are
00:42:36.52 --> 00:42:38.44 is going to come out.
00:42:38.44 --> 00:42:43.96 He said, I wish I wrote an exact what his character will be connected to your conduct.
00:42:43.96 --> 00:42:49.000 Who you really are eventually is going to influence how you behave?
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.68 If your plan is to put on a good front at work, you're going to get found out and the damage
00:42:54.68 --> 00:43:00.36 to that your credibility and the damage to the team, if that's, that you just simply cannot
00:43:00.36 --> 00:43:05.16 separate who you are as a leader and have a period of time or a place where you don't have
00:43:05.16 --> 00:43:07.68 to hold yourself to that same standard.
00:43:07.68 --> 00:43:13.72 That's what I wrote down when you were talking was, hey, you can try and put up
00:43:13.72 --> 00:43:16.68 that front, you already said, well, you try and put up that front.
00:43:16.68 --> 00:43:21.88 If you and your mind and your little tiny brain, because it is tiny, if this is what you think
00:43:21.88 --> 00:43:23.08 you have a small brain.
00:43:23.08 --> 00:43:26.84 If in your brain, your tiny little brain you think it doesn't really matter no one will
00:43:26.84 --> 00:43:33.08 notice your brain is small and you are stupid because everybody sees that, everybody.
00:43:33.08 --> 00:43:37.000 And everybody is watching you all the time.
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000 They're watching you.
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.20 They see you all the time.
00:43:42.20 --> 00:43:44.20 Easy.
00:43:44.20 --> 00:43:48.36 While the commander should place heavy emphasis on re-enlistment and do all in his power
00:43:48.36 --> 00:43:52.60 to retain effective personnel, he should bear in mind that the army wants quality not
00:43:52.60 --> 00:43:56.48 quantity, make your program selective.
00:43:56.48 --> 00:43:59.76 Social life, every army post should be close, net, happy family.
00:43:59.76 --> 00:44:05.56 Commanders can foster this by ensuring that families of their men have adequate social life.
00:44:05.56 --> 00:44:09.84 A particular importance is the inclusion of youth activities designed, especially for youth
00:44:09.84 --> 00:44:13.52 and not for adults, good programs in this field will not just happen, they will require
00:44:13.52 --> 00:44:18.20 your best people.
00:44:18.20 --> 00:44:24.52 You know when you start looking at building what you just said, you know, how do you expect
00:44:24.52 --> 00:44:30.80 the people to act if you haven't given them a good support structure with their family?
00:44:30.80 --> 00:44:32.28 Just doesn't work.
00:44:32.28 --> 00:44:35.60 It is essential that all recommendations he talks about this non-commissioned officers
00:44:35.60 --> 00:44:39.52 advisory council, which is, hey, you've got to, you've got to, you can, you can
00:44:39.52 --> 00:44:45.92 have a symbol groups of your workers, of your team, of your employees, the leaders, the
00:44:45.92 --> 00:44:51.60 frontline troops, you can assemble groups of them and get feedback from them.
00:44:51.60 --> 00:44:54.80 And he says it's essential that all recommendations receive the attention of the major
00:44:54.80 --> 00:44:59.28 commander concerned for failure to act on justified recommendations will defeat the whole
00:44:59.28 --> 00:45:04.52 purpose of having these councils.
00:45:04.52 --> 00:45:08.76 And you know, it's interesting we've been doing some work at echelon front with some of these
00:45:08.76 --> 00:45:15.28 councils, which is always cool because now you're getting people from different, different
00:45:15.28 --> 00:45:19.72 cross sections of the company that are sort of these councils and that's been interesting.
00:45:19.72 --> 00:45:20.72 It's been very interesting.
00:45:20.72 --> 00:45:26.48 And it's kind of what we do anyways when we go into a company, we, you know, we get
00:45:26.48 --> 00:45:29.88 a cross section, but it's nice when the companies already have a cross section that we are
00:45:29.88 --> 00:45:30.88 talking to.
00:45:30.88 --> 00:45:35.08 So, if you're running a company right now or if you're in a company right now, it's
00:45:35.08 --> 00:45:39.52 a good idea to think about putting together some kind of a council where you say, hey,
00:45:39.52 --> 00:45:44.76 we need to take the best ideas, take the best practices, take the grievances that we have,
00:45:44.76 --> 00:45:48.32 assemble them together in a logical way to push them up the chain of command because if the,
00:45:48.32 --> 00:45:52.92 if the boss, you know, has us work and laid every Friday and the boss doesn't know how much
00:45:52.92 --> 00:45:57.64 that negatively impacts us, how can we expect them to change it?
00:45:57.64 --> 00:46:00.84 Answer, we cannot get together.
00:46:00.84 --> 00:46:09.48 Put forth information in a consolidated effort so that the boss knows what's happening.
00:46:09.48 --> 00:46:15.44 And if you're the boss and you get that feedback, implement as best you can act on it.
00:46:15.44 --> 00:46:16.44 Yeah.
00:46:16.44 --> 00:46:20.08 Direction staffs, the staff is no more than an extension of the commander's abilities and
00:46:20.08 --> 00:46:23.12 a good commander must be able to handle the staff property.
00:46:23.12 --> 00:46:27.76 Officers of a staff should carry out the commander's policies enthusiastically by the same
00:46:27.76 --> 00:46:29.56 token.
00:46:29.56 --> 00:46:34.40 They should bring to the attention of the commander, those matters deserving his personal
00:46:34.40 --> 00:46:38.04 attention.
00:46:38.04 --> 00:46:47.24 Staff visits to make sound decisions the commander must receive timely and reliable reports from
00:46:47.24 --> 00:46:53.72 his staff, which means that his staff must visit unit activities.
00:46:53.72 --> 00:47:01.16 So talk to us, Dave, about what they're talking about when they say staff.
00:47:01.16 --> 00:47:09.12 So like when I was a commander of a unit, my staff, I had, I had subordinate leaders that
00:47:09.12 --> 00:47:11.60 were responsible for different elements.
00:47:11.60 --> 00:47:14.20 So I'd have like an operation staff that ran the operations.
00:47:14.20 --> 00:47:17.64 I have a maintenance staff that ran the maintenance and logistics and supply and all the
00:47:17.64 --> 00:47:18.64 different components.
00:47:18.64 --> 00:47:23.000 And I would underneath these leaders, which were really staff officers kind of building the
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.04 plans were a whole bunch of people implementing their processes or their SOPs or whatever
00:47:28.04 --> 00:47:29.44 they created.
00:47:29.44 --> 00:47:33.92 If you got a staff officer, someone working for you that has a plan and has their team implementing
00:47:33.92 --> 00:47:36.84 the plan out in the field or out on the flight line.
00:47:36.84 --> 00:47:41.32 And they don't go out there to see how effective it is, what the real barriers are, what
00:47:41.32 --> 00:47:45.96 the problems are, and they are sort of operating in that vacuum of their staff position
00:47:45.96 --> 00:47:48.12 or in their cubicle their office.
00:47:48.12 --> 00:47:49.44 And they're out out there with those people.
00:47:49.44 --> 00:47:54.20 They have no sense of the real feedback of the problems and the challenges that people
00:47:54.20 --> 00:47:57.56 facing while they're implementing their plans.
00:47:57.56 --> 00:48:01.92 And so it comes, I think it's as simple as what you described.
00:48:01.92 --> 00:48:05.28 I think you said it like in the first pages, leave your office and go out and spend time
00:48:05.28 --> 00:48:07.32 with your people to see what's really going on down there.
00:48:07.32 --> 00:48:10.60 But what if seven years ago I had that job and I kind of remember what it was like back
00:48:10.60 --> 00:48:11.60 then?
00:48:11.60 --> 00:48:12.60 Is that good?
00:48:12.60 --> 00:48:14.60 Is that a cover of me?
00:48:14.60 --> 00:48:16.60 No.
00:48:16.60 --> 00:48:23.96 The, it also is just the connection to having your people see that you're willing to go out
00:48:23.96 --> 00:48:25.76 there and just spend time with them.
00:48:25.76 --> 00:48:28.48 The benefit of spending time with your people.
00:48:28.48 --> 00:48:32.12 On one sense it's actually really important and we can talk about all the different things
00:48:32.12 --> 00:48:34.72 that I would learn when I just spent time with my people.
00:48:34.72 --> 00:48:35.72 I learned about things.
00:48:35.72 --> 00:48:36.72 I learned how things worked.
00:48:36.72 --> 00:48:38.64 I learned the challenges they had.
00:48:38.64 --> 00:48:42.24 But there is a matter, there is some level of effort that it takes for you to get away
00:48:42.24 --> 00:48:45.64 from your desk as a leader to go spend time with your people.
00:48:45.64 --> 00:48:48.08 And most of the time your troops actually understand that.
00:48:48.08 --> 00:48:51.44 They know it's not as simple for the CEO to just get away.
00:48:51.44 --> 00:48:56.96 So when you do the power of, of you doing that on, is really significant.
00:48:56.96 --> 00:48:59.64 They recognize that you're making the effort to do it.
00:48:59.64 --> 00:49:03.000 If your plan is to do, we call these touch and go, I had to go out there and show your
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.48 face to the team.
00:49:04.48 --> 00:49:08.12 If that's your kind of like, hey, I'm going to show my face and you don't actually get
00:49:08.12 --> 00:49:10.20 out spend time with them, they're going to see that coming in my way.
00:49:10.20 --> 00:49:14.80 But if you just spend a little time, what you'll end up getting is a bunch of unfiltered
00:49:14.80 --> 00:49:18.20 feedback that didn't run through the chain and get chopped by all your staff, although
00:49:18.20 --> 00:49:19.60 we have to you, you get unfiltered.
00:49:19.60 --> 00:49:21.80 Get sterilized totally.
00:49:21.80 --> 00:49:26.60 You know what, what you want more than anything, you want a 19 year old Lance Corporal
00:49:26.60 --> 00:49:32.04 who is turning a wrench on a jet to explain to you why this is hard.
00:49:32.04 --> 00:49:34.88 Now, of course, you want to use the chain to come in.
00:49:34.88 --> 00:49:36.16 I want that to run through the chain.
00:49:36.16 --> 00:49:38.84 I want to see that multiple ways.
00:49:38.84 --> 00:49:42.48 But if you want unfiltered feedback to which really going on with your team, you have to
00:49:42.48 --> 00:49:48.12 get down to spend time with your team.
00:49:48.12 --> 00:49:49.68 That being said, back to the book.
00:49:49.68 --> 00:49:54.88 It is essential, however, that a staff officer making such visits understands the thin
00:49:54.88 --> 00:50:01.20 line that divides staff supervision from metal some interference.
00:50:01.20 --> 00:50:02.72 So there's the dichotomy of leadership.
00:50:02.72 --> 00:50:03.92 He'll be jumping the chain.
00:50:03.92 --> 00:50:08.04 He must realize that he is not a commander.
00:50:08.04 --> 00:50:12.88 He should avoid criticizing subordinate commanders and report and said they're shortcomings.
00:50:12.88 --> 00:50:18.08 Two is commander and should you see that his reports reflect favorably as well as unfavorable
00:50:18.08 --> 00:50:19.08 conditions.
00:50:19.08 --> 00:50:22.44 So you've got to make sure that you're not just being a rat going out there.
00:50:22.44 --> 00:50:26.08 And you've got to make sure that you don't interfere.
00:50:26.08 --> 00:50:28.08 It can cause interference.
00:50:28.08 --> 00:50:31.80 If Dave, you're having a meeting at S.L.M.
00:50:31.80 --> 00:50:37.000 front and you've got all the instructors because you want to cover some L-dap information
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.64 and you're doing a Zoom meeting and you're going to talk shop about a bunch of different
00:50:40.64 --> 00:50:43.84 things and all of a sudden I just pop in there.
00:50:43.84 --> 00:50:45.88 Well, you know, what am I doing in there?
00:50:45.88 --> 00:50:47.88 And you had a agenda and all of a sudden I'm in there.
00:50:47.88 --> 00:50:52.000 There's times where I'm just causing interference.
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.32 And that's really not what we're looking to do.
00:50:56.32 --> 00:50:59.16 Now all that being said, go ahead.
00:50:59.16 --> 00:51:03.68 I was just going to say, especially as I got more senior when I was in charge of an entire
00:51:03.68 --> 00:51:05.000 squadron.
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.000 My bias was actually towards trying to spend time.
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.16 And my bias was towards normalizing the review of me as a person.
00:51:13.16 --> 00:51:15.60 And let me just explain that for a minute.
00:51:15.60 --> 00:51:19.16 Every single person in the squadron knew who the squadron commander was.
00:51:19.16 --> 00:51:23.52 Everybody from the next the next in command to me, my number two guy, all the way down
00:51:23.52 --> 00:51:25.40 to the most my most junior marine.
00:51:25.40 --> 00:51:31.48 And if I did nothing, the natural state would be for them to put almost put me in
00:51:31.48 --> 00:51:32.48 a pedestal.
00:51:32.48 --> 00:51:35.84 Now they couldn't even relate to me as a person.
00:51:35.84 --> 00:51:39.12 Along with that, I really didn't have a lot of time.
00:51:39.12 --> 00:51:43.12 I was busy doing a lot of things, especially dealing with higher headquarters and other
00:51:43.12 --> 00:51:44.12 components.
00:51:44.12 --> 00:51:45.92 So I didn't have all day every day.
00:51:45.92 --> 00:51:50.72 So the times that I was out there was rare because I'd simply had a lot going on.
00:51:50.72 --> 00:51:53.64 So my bias and I'm talking the needle a little bit off center.
00:51:53.64 --> 00:51:57.92 My bias was if I could spend a little more time and set up a little less time, if I could
00:51:57.92 --> 00:52:02.16 get a little more understanding what's going on, then a little less, that was my bias.
00:52:02.16 --> 00:52:09.64 Because the natural tendency for most people would almost put a commander on a pedestal.
00:52:09.64 --> 00:52:11.88 It's not even a person.
00:52:11.88 --> 00:52:15.76 He's elevated to a status, it's almost unrelatable.
00:52:15.76 --> 00:52:19.44 And if I could create just a little bit of falling of, hey, I'm a normal person.
00:52:19.44 --> 00:52:20.96 I really want to know what's going on in here.
00:52:20.96 --> 00:52:23.96 I really want to have some connection on what you're doing.
00:52:23.96 --> 00:52:24.96 I would bias towards that.
00:52:24.96 --> 00:52:26.88 There were so many other forces at play.
00:52:26.88 --> 00:52:30.36 There was very little risk of me being the type of guy that I'm just hanging out, I hate
00:52:30.36 --> 00:52:31.36 what's going on down here.
00:52:31.36 --> 00:52:33.32 How's your boss and what?
00:52:33.32 --> 00:52:37.36 So the risk of there was lower, the other point, I think that point is totally valid.
00:52:37.36 --> 00:52:41.64 And the reason I'm making mention of this is that at least in the military, the chain
00:52:41.64 --> 00:52:44.08 of command is understood.
00:52:44.08 --> 00:52:49.24 And the barrier for me was that being so rigid that people didn't see me as a person who
00:52:49.24 --> 00:52:51.16 really want to know what's going on.
00:52:51.16 --> 00:52:55.88 So I would bias in that direction as if I was splitting the difference when what I was
00:52:55.88 --> 00:52:59.80 going to do, I would try to spend more time than less.
00:52:59.80 --> 00:53:03.88 If you're not seen as a human being, you don't have connections with the troops, if you
00:53:03.88 --> 00:53:07.12 don't have connections with the troops, none of this, none of it, nothing that we're talking
00:53:07.12 --> 00:53:10.96 about even matters, anyway, shape or form basically.
00:53:10.96 --> 00:53:16.72 Basically, you've got to be a person.
00:53:16.72 --> 00:53:21.72 The question of visitors, back to the book, a commander can expect many inspectors and visitors
00:53:21.72 --> 00:53:26.16 and it should be his policy to encourage and welcome visits and import from important
00:53:26.16 --> 00:53:27.16 officials.
00:53:27.16 --> 00:53:32.12 This of course means that his house must be constantly kept in order.
00:53:32.12 --> 00:53:37.88 That is how it should be for the unit that is uniformly excellent in all things that
00:53:37.88 --> 00:53:42.88 all times is one that will be outstanding in battle.
00:53:42.88 --> 00:53:49.44 Look upon visitors not as interruptions or harassment, but as the chance to show the public
00:53:49.44 --> 00:53:52.16 just how really good your unit is.
00:53:52.16 --> 00:53:54.04 That's pretty epic, dude.
00:53:54.04 --> 00:53:55.68 That is so important.
00:53:55.68 --> 00:54:00.96 I keep coming back to my time as a squadron commander, because when I commanded a unit,
00:54:00.96 --> 00:54:04.48 it was the very first operational F-35 B squadron in the world.
00:54:04.48 --> 00:54:08.68 It was the focal point of all things marine aviation.
00:54:08.68 --> 00:54:15.60 It was a under emichor scope, and we had visitors all the time.
00:54:15.60 --> 00:54:21.48 Everything from US senators, four star generals, local congressmen, everybody wanted, there's
00:54:21.48 --> 00:54:24.64 a massive investment in time and they wanted to know what was going on.
00:54:24.64 --> 00:54:29.12 There's a propensity towards when we get a note, hey, you're getting a notification, you're
00:54:29.12 --> 00:54:31.76 getting this delegation's coming to visit.
00:54:31.76 --> 00:54:35.44 They would focus their time on his preparing for that visit.
00:54:35.44 --> 00:54:39.92 I wanted no time spent on preparation for the visit.
00:54:39.92 --> 00:54:42.44 We're not going to clean the floors.
00:54:42.44 --> 00:54:43.72 We're going to operate as normal.
00:54:43.72 --> 00:54:47.92 I want them to come down and see, and if you are actually at that square to a unit, you
00:54:47.92 --> 00:54:50.12 don't need to prepare for those visits.
00:54:50.12 --> 00:54:53.40 If your plan is, oh, they're coming, hey, everybody started cleaning up.
00:54:53.40 --> 00:54:57.36 Shot in your boots and empty and trash cans and cleaning the tops of doors that you
00:54:57.36 --> 00:55:00.28 things you would not normally do.
00:55:00.28 --> 00:55:05.40 My view on visits was they can show up any place, any time, anywhere with no notice.
00:55:05.40 --> 00:55:06.40 I don't care.
00:55:06.40 --> 00:55:07.84 If I'm not there, no factor.
00:55:07.84 --> 00:55:08.84 Somebody will cover down.
00:55:08.84 --> 00:55:12.44 Staff Sergeant will cover down, Lieutenant, I don't care.
00:55:12.44 --> 00:55:14.44 The message that sent to the Marines was twofold.
00:55:14.44 --> 00:55:17.28 As one is hit the boss, doesn't freak out when people come to visit.
00:55:17.28 --> 00:55:18.28 It's no big deal.
00:55:18.28 --> 00:55:21.72 If we're actually a square to waste with, think we are, who cares?
00:55:21.72 --> 00:55:22.72 Show up, come check it out.
00:55:22.72 --> 00:55:25.92 You're going to see what you're going to see is the best squadron in the world.
00:55:25.92 --> 00:55:26.92 That's what you're going to see.
00:55:26.92 --> 00:55:27.92 So no factor.
00:55:27.92 --> 00:55:29.72 Visits are not a big deal.
00:55:29.72 --> 00:55:37.56 Check, unit athletic programs, athletic programs developed in conjunction with the physical
00:55:37.56 --> 00:55:38.56 fitness program.
00:55:38.56 --> 00:55:41.000 We'll do much to enhance the physical stamina of unit.
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.16 Why do I cover this?
00:55:43.16 --> 00:55:45.24 Why do I, why don't I even cover this?
00:55:45.24 --> 00:55:47.68 Well, because it's true.
00:55:47.68 --> 00:55:52.68 Well, because if we're out there, so focused on leadership that we don't, we let our
00:55:52.68 --> 00:55:57.64 physical bodies fall apart, we're wrong.
00:55:57.64 --> 00:56:02.84 And he knows that an active, an active interest in athletics is provided by the commander
00:56:02.84 --> 00:56:06.24 through proper motivation and personal interest.
00:56:06.24 --> 00:56:11.40 A well-planned and integrated athletic program is an important part of any unit training
00:56:11.40 --> 00:56:12.40 program.
00:56:12.40 --> 00:56:19.24 It will take the minds of the men off what some of them consider as the monotony of training.
00:56:19.24 --> 00:56:24.28 We'll keep the command and better physical shape, help build a unit, a speed of core, help
00:56:24.28 --> 00:56:32.48 develop self-discipline and team spirit.
00:56:32.48 --> 00:56:34.68 Man, we get away from that.
00:56:34.68 --> 00:56:39.48 Emphasis in athletic programs should be on the small unit level, such as company battery
00:56:39.48 --> 00:56:42.04 troop rather than at higher levels.
00:56:42.04 --> 00:56:48.92 So look, I don't know what situation you're in in life or what your business is doing,
00:56:48.92 --> 00:56:55.80 but doing something physical together is very, very helpful.
00:56:55.80 --> 00:56:59.84 Anybody that's ever done an FTAx with echelon front, it was exactly what you're talking.
00:56:59.84 --> 00:57:01.40 Yeah, even come to the master.
00:57:01.40 --> 00:57:06.000 Come to the master and come do PT at the master and you're doing something that's hard,
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.36 but it's fun and we're having a good time.
00:57:09.36 --> 00:57:14.24 We're doing them, by the way, we're doing the master December 4th and 5th.
00:57:14.24 --> 00:57:17.60 No, December 3rd and 4th in Texas.
00:57:17.60 --> 00:57:21.000 And we're still going to do PT, we're not quite figured out what we're doing instead
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.52 of due jutsu on the closing night, but we're going to figure something awesome out.
00:57:25.52 --> 00:57:27.16 But why?
00:57:27.16 --> 00:57:28.16 Why do we do that?
00:57:28.16 --> 00:57:30.44 Because people feel better.
00:57:30.44 --> 00:57:34.72 It brings the, look, people that will have thousand people there, well, for the
00:57:34.72 --> 00:57:37.88 master in the next master, we want to have thousand people there.
00:57:37.88 --> 00:57:42.48 We'll probably have a third of that or maybe half that.
00:57:42.48 --> 00:57:44.48 But people from all over the country will get together.
00:57:44.48 --> 00:57:50.48 They've never met before and they will bond in 45 minutes of early morning PT.
00:57:50.48 --> 00:57:54.92 If you get up at five in the morning and PT, you'll be less tired than if you got up
00:57:54.92 --> 00:57:56.96 at seven in the morning and went straight to the conference room.
00:57:56.96 --> 00:57:58.20 You'll be less tired.
00:57:58.20 --> 00:58:01.84 Stopped at the donut factory.
00:58:01.84 --> 00:58:06.56 So he talks about attractive living areas, you know, providing people a good place to live.
00:58:06.56 --> 00:58:14.44 Well, that applies with applying, supplying people to good place to work.
00:58:14.44 --> 00:58:16.72 Maintenance and supply economy.
00:58:16.72 --> 00:58:21.08 You'll recall that on the subject of training habits, I said that men will do in combat.
00:58:21.08 --> 00:58:24.92 What they have been taught and practice in training.
00:58:24.92 --> 00:58:27.84 This is equally true in the area of maintenance.
00:58:27.84 --> 00:58:32.44 For in combat, high maintenance standards become a matter of life and death of equal
00:58:32.44 --> 00:58:35.76 significance is supply economy.
00:58:35.76 --> 00:58:41.72 That wasted bullet or gallon of gas may seem insignificant now, but what a difference
00:58:41.72 --> 00:58:45.28 it may make when the chips are down exclamation point.
00:58:45.28 --> 00:58:46.76 I think that's the only exclamation point.
00:58:46.76 --> 00:58:50.04 He uses in this book.
00:58:50.04 --> 00:58:56.80 You train how you fight and if you're allowed to be sloppy or cut corners and not do the
00:58:56.80 --> 00:59:02.92 maintenance, where you're going to end up in a bad way.
00:59:02.92 --> 00:59:08.72 Good leadership on the company level can only thrive in a climate of good commander ship
00:59:08.72 --> 00:59:12.000 on the battalion level and above.
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:18.88 What company commanders have a right to expect from commanders above?
00:59:18.88 --> 00:59:23.32 So here, look, if you're working, if you're a boss, this is what you should be providing
00:59:23.32 --> 00:59:25.36 to the people below you.
00:59:25.36 --> 00:59:31.44 That their honest errors be pointed out, but be underwritten at least once in the interest
00:59:31.44 --> 00:59:34.20 of developing initiative and leadership.
00:59:34.20 --> 00:59:35.52 Boom.
00:59:35.52 --> 00:59:36.88 What does that mean?
00:59:36.88 --> 00:59:42.84 It means if someone makes mistake one time, you don't drop the hammer on them, you
00:59:42.84 --> 00:59:47.92 show them support that they had initiative, that they showed good leadership.
00:59:47.92 --> 00:59:50.20 So that's what we're supposed to point them out.
00:59:50.20 --> 00:59:54.88 Hey Dave, bad initiative or good initiative, bad judgment.
00:59:54.88 --> 00:59:59.16 You know, I like that you took action, but let's think through the action that you
00:59:59.16 --> 01:00:00.16 took.
01:00:00.16 --> 01:00:01.72 That's fine.
01:00:01.72 --> 01:00:08.96 To be responsible for and be allowed to develop their own units with only essential guidance
01:00:08.96 --> 01:00:12.88 from above.
01:00:12.88 --> 01:00:18.36 You are responsible for developing, however you want to do it, Dave, you got your team,
01:00:18.36 --> 01:00:20.56 however you want to develop that team.
01:00:20.56 --> 01:00:25.24 Here's the minimum requirements and this is the mission.
01:00:25.24 --> 01:00:26.64 Only the essential guidance.
01:00:26.64 --> 01:00:27.64 What do we say?
01:00:27.64 --> 01:00:29.28 We say minimum force required.
01:00:29.28 --> 01:00:32.72 We want to lead with a minimum force required.
01:00:32.72 --> 01:00:40.20 A helpful attitude toward their problems, loyalty down as well as up, that they not be subjected
01:00:40.20 --> 01:00:49.36 to the needling of unproductive statistics, competitions between like units, just harassing
01:00:49.36 --> 01:00:56.48 people, the best in command or ship, that the needs of their units be anticipated and provided
01:00:56.48 --> 01:00:57.48 for.
01:00:57.48 --> 01:01:01.44 That's not too much to ask that I anticipate that Dave's going to need more bullets or
01:01:01.44 --> 01:01:04.16 more ammunition or more fuel.
01:01:04.16 --> 01:01:10.88 And I have it for him to be kept oriented as to the mission and situation of the unit
01:01:10.88 --> 01:01:16.96 above, well, fought out program of training, work and recreation, good training and work
01:01:16.96 --> 01:01:21.92 management to receive timely, clear cut and positive orders and decisions which are not
01:01:21.92 --> 01:01:26.28 constantly changed.
01:01:26.28 --> 01:01:32.36 The integrity of their tactical units be maintained in assigning essential tasks.
01:01:32.36 --> 01:01:35.84 That was so smart.
01:01:35.84 --> 01:01:37.32 That was a little trick that I did.
01:01:37.32 --> 01:01:40.64 I would keep my little fire teams together, keep the squad together as much as I could
01:01:40.64 --> 01:01:42.36 I could keep the platoon together as much as I could look.
01:01:42.36 --> 01:01:43.96 We were interoperable.
01:01:43.96 --> 01:01:48.88 But if you can keep a fire team together, they are so good to go.
01:01:48.88 --> 01:01:50.36 You want them tied.
01:01:50.36 --> 01:01:58.24 You think a couple of them you said anticipate the needs of their units be anticipated and
01:01:58.24 --> 01:01:59.24 provided for them.
01:01:59.24 --> 01:02:02.40 Think about that word though that the needs are anticipated.
01:02:02.40 --> 01:02:03.84 That is a real word in there.
01:02:03.84 --> 01:02:05.08 That is not, I'm here.
01:02:05.08 --> 01:02:07.52 Hey, when you run out of stuff, come up and tell me, hey, and you run it through the
01:02:07.52 --> 01:02:11.000 chain and command and give me the the triple kit paperwork to give you what you need.
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.92 It's me knowing what's going on down there and going, hey, Jocco, you're the team
01:02:13.92 --> 01:02:15.88 who have been getting after it man.
01:02:15.88 --> 01:02:17.84 How's your stash of this supplier?
01:02:17.84 --> 01:02:18.84 How's this going on here?
01:02:18.84 --> 01:02:19.84 Are you running low?
01:02:19.84 --> 01:02:23.84 Work in this not to get this to you and you're thinking damn.
01:02:23.84 --> 01:02:25.32 He didn't just cut us loose.
01:02:25.32 --> 01:02:28.88 He's actually paying attention when it's going on down here and I was about to send up
01:02:28.88 --> 01:02:32.36 the request but I don't like asking my boss for stuff so I was kind of worried about
01:02:32.36 --> 01:02:36.04 asking him and he's thinking, I've noticed you guys have been cranking, do you need some
01:02:36.04 --> 01:02:37.04 of this?
01:02:37.04 --> 01:02:38.88 You're anticipating the needs.
01:02:38.88 --> 01:02:42.40 Not just responding to their needs but actually thinking about it.
01:02:42.40 --> 01:02:46.28 I mean, you want to talk about being a commander, being a leader, knowing what your people
01:02:46.28 --> 01:02:49.80 are going through and giving them what they need before they have to ask for it.
01:02:49.80 --> 01:02:51.80 That word is no small word.
01:02:51.80 --> 01:02:52.80 Yeah.
01:02:52.80 --> 01:03:00.80 And then the parsing of that word that you just used could clarify that for everyone here.
01:03:00.80 --> 01:03:06.24 You said you need to actually think about it.
01:03:06.24 --> 01:03:07.24 What does that mean?
01:03:07.24 --> 01:03:10.68 That means while you're daydreaming while you're sitting around doing whatever you're
01:03:10.68 --> 01:03:14.60 doing this anticipation isn't just going to come and smack you in the face.
01:03:14.60 --> 01:03:16.000 You need to set aside a little time.
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.32 You need to look at what that unit's doing.
01:03:17.32 --> 01:03:22.12 You need to figure out you need to actually think about what's going on.
01:03:22.12 --> 01:03:25.88 What a novel idea.
01:03:25.88 --> 01:03:31.88 That reminds me of way the warrior kid where the first one, Mark thinks he should know
01:03:31.88 --> 01:03:34.60 his times tables and Uncle J.X.
01:03:34.60 --> 01:03:37.36 will have you studied and he says, what do you mean study?
01:03:37.36 --> 01:03:38.36 I should just know him.
01:03:38.36 --> 01:03:39.36 No.
01:03:39.36 --> 01:03:42.12 And you're not going to be able to just randomly anticipate people's needs.
01:03:42.12 --> 01:03:45.96 You need to actually think about it.
01:03:45.96 --> 01:03:49.40 And the last one in this chapter.
01:03:49.40 --> 01:03:51.20 Oh, sorry, not the last one yet.
01:03:51.20 --> 01:03:57.68 That their successes be measured by the overall ability of a unit to perform its whole mission
01:03:57.68 --> 01:04:01.04 and not by the performance of one or two factors.
01:04:01.04 --> 01:04:04.32 So look at people holistically.
01:04:04.32 --> 01:04:05.64 Look at units holistically.
01:04:05.64 --> 01:04:10.20 And then this is the last one that good works by their units be recognized and rewarded
01:04:10.20 --> 01:04:14.84 in such a way as to motivate the greatest number to do well and seek further improvement.
01:04:14.84 --> 01:04:15.84 Good.
01:04:15.84 --> 01:04:21.56 Now we're going to roll into chapter two.
01:04:21.56 --> 01:04:25.08 This is called leadership versus popularity.
01:04:25.08 --> 01:04:26.08 And this is interesting.
01:04:26.08 --> 01:04:31.56 This is where I start to sometimes when I'm reading leadership things in my way.
01:04:31.56 --> 01:04:33.44 Wow, that's really not my viewpoint.
01:04:33.44 --> 01:04:34.44 Hold on a second.
01:04:34.44 --> 01:04:35.44 Like this is a little.
01:04:35.44 --> 01:04:40.48 And then I continue to read and I find, oh, he's saying it a little bit differently
01:04:40.48 --> 01:04:45.48 but he or he sometimes people are actually saying something different but they don't
01:04:45.48 --> 01:04:46.48 even mean it.
01:04:46.48 --> 01:04:48.20 They don't even mean it.
01:04:48.20 --> 01:04:49.64 And you're just to see what I'm talking about.
01:04:49.64 --> 01:04:56.44 So leadership versus popularity, the example of a strong leader.
01:04:56.44 --> 01:05:01.16 During the World War II period, I served as a division commander.
01:05:01.16 --> 01:05:07.48 I served a division commander as his chief of staff and later as one of his combat commanders
01:05:07.48 --> 01:05:09.56 for a period of over two years.
01:05:09.56 --> 01:05:12.24 He was a strong character and a strong leader.
01:05:12.24 --> 01:05:17.04 He had firm ideas about things that he liked and disliked and placed requirements on his
01:05:17.04 --> 01:05:22.12 officers and men in the fields of wearing equipment and uniforms tactical disposition during
01:05:22.12 --> 01:05:27.76 field training, the care and handling of vehicles and other things, many of which were
01:05:27.76 --> 01:05:29.76 unpopular.
01:05:29.76 --> 01:05:34.60 At one time in an evening discussion period, I pointed out that these requirements to him and
01:05:34.60 --> 01:05:40.12 asked him if he felt that the effort he put into them was not excessive for the practical
01:05:40.12 --> 01:05:42.12 results which he achieved.
01:05:42.12 --> 01:05:47.96 His answer gave me insight into the problems of training and preparations and preparing
01:05:47.96 --> 01:05:54.48 troops for emergencies or battle for which I've never forgotten.
01:05:54.48 --> 01:06:00.56 He stated that in case of an emergency or battle, a commander was required to place upon
01:06:00.56 --> 01:06:05.84 his officers and men many requirements that were unpopular and for which time was not available
01:06:05.84 --> 01:06:07.08 for hesitation.
01:06:07.08 --> 01:06:13.32 The thought of being popular or unpopular should never enter the mind of a commander.
01:06:13.32 --> 01:06:18.04 That's the part where I start going, heesh, wait a second, what are we talking about?
01:06:18.04 --> 01:06:22.20 I'm not totally there yet, but I'm a little nervous because what this translates to and
01:06:22.20 --> 01:06:25.36 Lafes talked about this before.
01:06:25.36 --> 01:06:32.72 Lafes had someone come and speak to the junior officers and senior officers and the message
01:06:32.72 --> 01:06:39.60 was, in no uncertain terms, when you're in charge, you should not be liked.
01:06:39.60 --> 01:06:40.60 You should not be liked.
01:06:40.60 --> 01:06:42.52 When you're in charge, you're going to make all these hardices.
01:06:42.52 --> 01:06:43.52 People aren't going to like you.
01:06:43.52 --> 01:06:44.96 You need to be okay with that.
01:06:44.96 --> 01:06:48.88 Lafes had to kind of like when this senior officer would leave, Lafes had to like back
01:06:48.88 --> 01:06:57.24 these guys down and say, listen, let me put that in perspective.
01:06:57.24 --> 01:07:03.52 So this is he pointed out that a commander who was unable to obtain compliance with unpopular
01:07:03.52 --> 01:07:07.76 requirements from his officers or men during training and during preparation for combat
01:07:07.76 --> 01:07:13.16 would not be able to obtain prompt compliance with his requirements to meet emergencies or
01:07:13.16 --> 01:07:15.56 to attack an enemy in battle.
01:07:15.56 --> 01:07:20.96 He said that the requirements he placed in the training periods served three purposes.
01:07:20.96 --> 01:07:26.44 One, they conditioned his command to carry out promptly his instructions to the way which
01:07:26.44 --> 01:07:32.88 his men carried out these requirements served as a constant measure to him of his old on
01:07:32.88 --> 01:07:39.56 his officers and his men and they with other things helped instill a fierce pride in the
01:07:39.56 --> 01:07:42.40 division.
01:07:42.40 --> 01:07:46.36 I might add that this officer was one of the most respected division commanders that
01:07:46.36 --> 01:07:52.08 I have known even now over 15 years after he left the division, he is the most popular
01:07:52.08 --> 01:07:56.88 man present when the division association has a convention.
01:07:56.88 --> 01:08:00.24 So all this talk about him not being concerned about me, oh, he is the most popular guy.
01:08:00.24 --> 01:08:01.44 I love him, yeah.
01:08:01.44 --> 01:08:03.20 Everybody loves this guy.
01:08:03.20 --> 01:08:04.36 Why do they love this guy?
01:08:04.36 --> 01:08:06.04 Do they love him because he was nice?
01:08:06.04 --> 01:08:10.36 Do they love him because he gave him extra brownies and ice cream?
01:08:10.36 --> 01:08:11.36 No.
01:08:11.36 --> 01:08:15.76 He loved them because he was dis, they loved him because he was disciplined.
01:08:15.76 --> 01:08:20.72 That's what they loved.
01:08:20.72 --> 01:08:25.76 Later on when I was placed in command of a combat command of the division, I remembered
01:08:25.76 --> 01:08:30.12 the procedure off and I was actually when I first read this thing, I thought he was talking
01:08:30.12 --> 01:08:34.72 about patent because he worked for patent but patent wasn't alive 15 years later to be
01:08:34.72 --> 01:08:35.72 the most popular guy.
01:08:35.72 --> 01:08:36.92 So I don't know who it was.
01:08:36.92 --> 01:08:41.24 I have to do more research.
01:08:41.24 --> 01:08:44.08 And this says an unpopular requirement that paid off.
01:08:44.08 --> 01:08:47.88 Later on when I was placed in command of a combat command of the division, I remembered
01:08:47.88 --> 01:08:53.000 the procedure often used at 11 worth of attacking at first light in the morning.
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.06 One of the reasons for doing this was in hopes of catching the enemy unprepared to resist
01:08:57.06 --> 01:08:58.06 attack.
01:08:58.06 --> 01:09:02.96 If we were taught this, if we were taught this, probably the enemy did likewise because
01:09:02.96 --> 01:09:08.56 of this whenever I had combat command in the field for training, I required every man to
01:09:08.56 --> 01:09:12.76 be up, dressed and manning his battle station at first light.
01:09:12.76 --> 01:09:16.84 Communications were checked all the way from squad level to me and reports of readiness
01:09:16.84 --> 01:09:20.28 were laid from the squad level to me.
01:09:20.28 --> 01:09:24.44 After daylight, and if it was decided that no attack was probable, the troops were permitted
01:09:24.44 --> 01:09:27.44 to eat breakfast and then proceed with the day's activities.
01:09:27.44 --> 01:09:30.68 I talked about this on the earliest of podcasts.
01:09:30.68 --> 01:09:35.60 This early morning stand to, that's what it's called, was never popular and there
01:09:35.60 --> 01:09:40.24 would be many requests to relax the requirement of it, particularly for men who had been
01:09:40.24 --> 01:09:41.68 on guard or night duty.
01:09:41.68 --> 01:09:45.76 While these requests were never granted, because these requests were never granted because
01:09:45.76 --> 01:09:50.84 I felt that if we were overrun while still asleep, the enemy would not spare the man who
01:09:50.84 --> 01:09:56.80 had been late getting into bed.
01:09:56.80 --> 01:10:01.64 This procedure was followed in my command throughout the war.
01:10:01.64 --> 01:10:05.84 I can say that even in the face of the enemy, it was not particularly popular.
01:10:05.84 --> 01:10:10.56 So even though even in combat, guys were like, bro, let me sleep in, sir, let me sleep
01:10:10.56 --> 01:10:11.56 in.
01:10:11.56 --> 01:10:12.56 Even in combat.
01:10:12.56 --> 01:10:15.68 Even in combat, where the enemy might really attack and kill you and overrun you
01:10:15.68 --> 01:10:20.24 and people will say, hey, man, can we just get some sleep in the morning?
01:10:20.24 --> 01:10:24.32 But he never, he never submitted to that.
01:10:24.32 --> 01:10:30.32 And he said, however, it did save elements of my command on several occasions from being
01:10:30.32 --> 01:10:33.08 overrun and destroyed in the early morning.
01:10:33.08 --> 01:10:37.16 At one time, a portion of the 37th tank battalion.
01:10:37.16 --> 01:10:38.16 How cool is that?
01:10:38.16 --> 01:10:39.16 The 137.
01:10:39.16 --> 01:10:40.16 The 7th.
01:10:40.16 --> 01:10:43.76 Shout out to the bandits battle over a body.
01:10:43.76 --> 01:10:48.94 A portion of the 37th tank battalion was saved from destruction by an enemy tank brigade
01:10:48.94 --> 01:10:52.92 attack in the fog at first light because it was ready.
01:10:52.92 --> 01:10:55.64 This particular requirement was probably most unpopular.
01:10:55.64 --> 01:11:00.000 My combat command headquarters and there was considerable griping about it on many occasions.
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:06.16 However, one morning when my command was in the rear of the enemy lines east of Nancy,
01:11:06.16 --> 01:11:09.76 the headquarters personnel were alert at first light, men were manning their defensive
01:11:09.76 --> 01:11:10.76 positions.
01:11:10.76 --> 01:11:12.96 Weapons had been checked at communications at the beginning of the established.
01:11:12.96 --> 01:11:17.96 In particular, the three tank destroyers attached to my headquarters were in position loaded
01:11:17.96 --> 01:11:19.96 and manned.
01:11:19.96 --> 01:11:26.32 At first light, a platoon of enemy tanks came into the headquarters area, which in the case
01:11:26.32 --> 01:11:30.000 of a combat command headquarters was not very large.
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.32 The tank destroyers immediately took them under fire and succeeded in knocking out three
01:11:34.32 --> 01:11:35.40 of the tanks.
01:11:35.40 --> 01:11:37.52 The other two withdrew.
01:11:37.52 --> 01:11:41.52 Our loss during this engagement was only one tank destroyer, which was destroyed by a direct
01:11:41.52 --> 01:11:42.92 hit from one of the enemy tanks.
01:11:42.92 --> 01:11:47.72 There was much discussion of this attack in the headquarters in the days that followed.
01:11:47.72 --> 01:11:51.48 One of the men stated that he never realized how crowded a combat command headquarters
01:11:51.48 --> 01:11:56.04 could be when an enemy attack came.
01:11:56.04 --> 01:12:01.80 I heard no more comments in my headquarters about the requirement for everybody being dressed
01:12:01.80 --> 01:12:04.08 alert in position in daylight.
01:12:04.08 --> 01:12:09.48 The purpose of this account is to point out that a commander and leader owes a responsibility
01:12:09.48 --> 01:12:17.000 to his men to require them to do things which are for their own benefit and for the benefit
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:25.04 of the command as a whole, even though their requirements are not popular.
01:12:25.04 --> 01:12:30.80 So you want to follow a threat, you want to follow a threat, go read the book about face
01:12:30.80 --> 01:12:36.40 and read what hack worth did when he took over the 439.
01:12:36.40 --> 01:12:39.92 Let's see, it's the exact same story.
01:12:39.92 --> 01:12:42.96 What he made these guys do was change their, you had to dig a hole to the sleep first of
01:12:42.96 --> 01:12:43.96 all.
01:12:43.96 --> 01:12:45.76 They actually started digging in.
01:12:45.76 --> 01:12:47.48 They started moving their positions every night.
01:12:47.48 --> 01:12:50.44 They started expanding the perimeter, retract their perimeter and by the way, when you dig
01:12:50.44 --> 01:12:55.28 a hole in Vietnam or really anywhere, when you dig a fighting hole, a fighting position and
01:12:55.28 --> 01:12:56.28 then you're going to move.
01:12:56.28 --> 01:12:59.16 Guess what you got to do with that one that you just left.
01:12:59.16 --> 01:13:00.80 You got to fill it in.
01:13:00.80 --> 01:13:05.16 So if we put out the perimeter and then we move back that night 25 or 50 meters because we
01:13:05.16 --> 01:13:08.52 don't want to get mortgages, we know the enemy saw where we were were.
01:13:08.52 --> 01:13:12.16 We got to fill in that fighting position because we don't want the enemy to be able to use
01:13:12.16 --> 01:13:13.16 it.
01:13:13.16 --> 01:13:14.64 So that's a lot of digging to be doing.
01:13:14.64 --> 01:13:18.04 To be doing, well guess what, he did this hack worth did this.
01:13:18.04 --> 01:13:24.36 Hey, they got rid of all the crap that they had in their battalion CP, they got rid of
01:13:24.36 --> 01:13:25.36 all that junk.
01:13:25.36 --> 01:13:28.58 They started digging in, they started moving their perimeter and the first time they got
01:13:28.58 --> 01:13:31.16 mortgard under his command.
01:13:31.16 --> 01:13:34.20 There were no casualties because the elements had moved and guess what?
01:13:34.20 --> 01:13:36.44 There was no more complaining.
01:13:36.44 --> 01:13:38.08 This is the exact same story.
01:13:38.08 --> 01:13:40.80 I wonder where Hack worth figured that out from.
01:13:40.80 --> 01:13:44.80 Totally.
01:13:44.80 --> 01:13:47.48 Next chapter.
01:13:47.48 --> 01:13:52.68 Ethics, conduct, and standards of officers.
01:13:52.68 --> 01:13:53.68 Subtitle.
01:13:53.68 --> 01:13:58.56 Set an example.
01:13:58.56 --> 01:14:00.20 What you know, I had such a good benefit.
01:14:00.20 --> 01:14:05.60 I benefited the luck that I had in my career in my life is amazing, but one of the most
01:14:05.60 --> 01:14:11.16 amazing things is when I was a young and listed guy in the SEAL teams, I was watching
01:14:11.16 --> 01:14:14.20 my lieutenant.
01:14:14.20 --> 01:14:16.16 I was tracking.
01:14:16.16 --> 01:14:18.68 I was tracking those boys.
01:14:18.68 --> 01:14:23.24 When they forgot to piece of gear, I was like, oh, when they were late, oh, I was tracking
01:14:23.24 --> 01:14:24.24 them.
01:14:24.24 --> 01:14:25.24 I knew that.
01:14:25.24 --> 01:14:30.08 I knew I knew better than anyone could have ever taught me or told me.
01:14:30.08 --> 01:14:31.28 I was like, well, we're sitting here saying this.
01:14:31.28 --> 01:14:32.28 You've said it five times today.
01:14:32.28 --> 01:14:33.64 I've said it eight times today.
01:14:33.64 --> 01:14:34.96 Your people are watching you.
01:14:34.96 --> 01:14:36.04 Your people are watching you.
01:14:36.04 --> 01:14:37.04 Your people are watching you.
01:14:37.04 --> 01:14:40.16 I could have been told that a hundred times and it wouldn't have been as effective as
01:14:40.16 --> 01:14:45.44 me actually knowing what it was like to watch my my bosses.
01:14:45.44 --> 01:14:48.68 And note the good and note the bad.
01:14:48.68 --> 01:14:50.16 Set an example.
01:14:50.16 --> 01:14:55.64 The ethics, conduct, and standards of behavior of a few of our officers are matters of
01:14:55.64 --> 01:14:57.16 real concern to me.
01:14:57.16 --> 01:15:01.36 Except for a few junior officers, our officers are either regular officers or reserve
01:15:01.36 --> 01:15:04.84 officers serving because they chose to do so.
01:15:04.84 --> 01:15:09.12 It is up to the latter group to set the proper example in all things for those junior
01:15:09.12 --> 01:15:10.12 officers.
01:15:10.12 --> 01:15:15.40 It is up to all officers to conduct themselves in such a manner that the prestige of the
01:15:15.40 --> 01:15:23.60 army officer will be high in the eyes of the public and of our enlisted men.
01:15:23.60 --> 01:15:32.40 And officer who behaves in an unbecoming manner destroys his standing in a unit.
01:15:32.40 --> 01:15:37.04 Man, if we broke out and started talking about what's unbecoming for a leader.
01:15:37.04 --> 01:15:40.64 Because you know, when you hear the word conduct, I'm becoming an officer.
01:15:40.64 --> 01:15:42.24 You think like, oh, this guy is out.
01:15:42.24 --> 01:15:43.68 Lack of like an idiot.
01:15:43.68 --> 01:15:47.40 What about when that guy shows up 12 minutes late?
01:15:47.40 --> 01:15:49.80 What about when that guy does bring the right piece of gear?
01:15:49.80 --> 01:15:51.52 What about when that guy loses temper?
01:15:51.52 --> 01:15:53.52 Whatever it is.
01:15:53.52 --> 01:15:54.52 All those little things.
01:15:54.52 --> 01:15:55.52 Yeah.
01:15:55.52 --> 01:15:57.96 All those little things add up.
01:15:57.96 --> 01:16:02.52 And if you were a leader in an organization, you got to understand that your people are
01:16:02.52 --> 01:16:04.000 watching you.
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.40 And what that actually is is an opportunity to pull them into your sphere of influence.
01:16:08.40 --> 01:16:12.96 Because as a young Marine, I was looking for role models too.
01:16:12.96 --> 01:16:17.08 I was looking when I was keeping track of those little things at little slip here, that
01:16:17.08 --> 01:16:19.52 little slack over here, that little error here.
01:16:19.52 --> 01:16:22.96 And I was looking around when I saw the ones that were holding the line.
01:16:22.96 --> 01:16:24.44 That's where I wanted to be.
01:16:24.44 --> 01:16:29.20 And if you're that leader, you will pull these people into your sphere of influence.
01:16:29.20 --> 01:16:30.80 And you can lead and match them.
01:16:30.80 --> 01:16:37.68 And you can have, you can design the culture of the entire unit by yourself just by
01:16:37.68 --> 01:16:39.28 setting that right example.
01:16:39.28 --> 01:16:42.08 Because you will pull people into your sphere.
01:16:42.08 --> 01:16:44.88 And they will follow that lead and they will do the same thing.
01:16:44.88 --> 01:16:48.000 And then all of a sudden you got folks down the organization that aren't holding the
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000 line.
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.60 You don't have to be the one to go down there and fix it.
01:16:50.60 --> 01:16:55.08 Because you've got this little army of people on your little team that are doing that
01:16:55.08 --> 01:16:58.24 across the organization.
01:16:58.24 --> 01:17:01.88 So I was in the teams back in the day.
01:17:01.88 --> 01:17:04.40 And I was getting ready.
01:17:04.40 --> 01:17:11.28 I think I was actually I had been picked up for the Seaman to Admiral program.
01:17:11.28 --> 01:17:14.84 So I was I had been picked up.
01:17:14.84 --> 01:17:16.36 And I was super stoked.
01:17:16.36 --> 01:17:18.04 And I was, but I was still at Seal team one.
01:17:18.04 --> 01:17:22.04 I had finished out my time there before I went to Austria candidate school.
01:17:22.04 --> 01:17:24.88 And then I would go from off-stricated school.
01:17:24.88 --> 01:17:26.24 So I either had been picked up.
01:17:26.24 --> 01:17:29.04 I think I'd been picked up.
01:17:29.04 --> 01:17:37.40 But another guy, another officer, another prior and listed officer who did the program that
01:17:37.40 --> 01:17:39.04 I was doing.
01:17:39.04 --> 01:17:40.04 Right?
01:17:40.04 --> 01:17:45.20 And he'd been picked up and he had gone to off-stricated school and then he showed up at
01:17:45.20 --> 01:17:46.52 Seal team one.
01:17:46.52 --> 01:17:50.40 So he was, you know, he was almost, he was very similar to me in the fact that we were both
01:17:50.40 --> 01:17:52.24 prior and listed guys, he got picked up.
01:17:52.24 --> 01:17:54.72 I think it was one year ahead of me.
01:17:54.72 --> 01:17:56.68 And he shows up at Seal team one.
01:17:56.68 --> 01:18:00.92 And I remember seeing this dude for the first time.
01:18:00.92 --> 01:18:08.28 And look, you know, I just looked at him and I was like, damn, this dude is squared away.
01:18:08.28 --> 01:18:11.72 And I couldn't even really, I couldn't even really understand.
01:18:11.72 --> 01:18:16.48 I said, well, why does this guy's whole uniform look?
01:18:16.48 --> 01:18:17.76 Square to away.
01:18:17.76 --> 01:18:20.72 This guy looks like he's on another level.
01:18:20.72 --> 01:18:24.28 And you know, wearing the locker room or whatever, well, guess what?
01:18:24.28 --> 01:18:25.88 He was wearing shirt stays.
01:18:25.88 --> 01:18:26.88 Do you know what those are?
01:18:26.88 --> 01:18:27.88 I do.
01:18:27.88 --> 01:18:29.16 I'm the one who you do.
01:18:29.16 --> 01:18:35.16 So he was wearing shirt stays, which is the way that you roll with at OCS.
01:18:35.16 --> 01:18:36.56 It's like, you're wearing shirt stays.
01:18:36.56 --> 01:18:37.56 That's all there's to it.
01:18:37.56 --> 01:18:39.72 So for those of you who don't know it, what shirts stays are.
01:18:39.72 --> 01:18:47.92 They are a piece of elastic material that you attach from the bottom of your shirt,
01:18:47.92 --> 01:18:53.72 which is tucked in and they run down your legs and then they attach to your socks.
01:18:53.72 --> 01:18:58.04 So no matter what happens, your shirt is freaking stay and put.
01:18:58.04 --> 01:19:02.04 And it looks like it looks like the uniform on a mannequin.
01:19:02.04 --> 01:19:03.40 It looks like that.
01:19:03.40 --> 01:19:06.20 Somebody dressed this thing for a mannequin.
01:19:06.20 --> 01:19:09.56 And so I remember seeing it going damn, and he just looked everything looks squared
01:19:09.56 --> 01:19:10.56 away about him.
01:19:10.56 --> 01:19:12.16 He was an awesome physical shape.
01:19:12.16 --> 01:19:13.16 Just a great guy.
01:19:13.16 --> 01:19:16.92 And he is an incredible guy.
01:19:16.92 --> 01:19:20.16 But I remember looking him going damn, this dude is squared away.
01:19:20.16 --> 01:19:21.16 And I saw those shirts stays.
01:19:21.16 --> 01:19:22.28 I didn't even know what those were.
01:19:22.28 --> 01:19:23.96 As an enlisted seal.
01:19:23.96 --> 01:19:24.96 You had no idea.
01:19:24.96 --> 01:19:27.24 Showed up at OCS.
01:19:27.24 --> 01:19:29.28 And you know what?
01:19:29.28 --> 01:19:30.28 Those shirts stays.
01:19:30.28 --> 01:19:34.56 Because pretty much when you're done with OCS, you'd know, really need to wear them anymore.
01:19:34.56 --> 01:19:35.56 Yeah.
01:19:35.56 --> 01:19:36.56 Guess what?
01:19:36.56 --> 01:19:37.56 He did.
01:19:37.56 --> 01:19:38.56 He did.
01:19:38.56 --> 01:19:39.48 And I did.
01:19:39.48 --> 01:19:44.04 I freaking wore those things religiously because that's the difference.
01:19:44.04 --> 01:19:45.40 That's the difference.
01:19:45.40 --> 01:19:46.80 That's setting the example.
01:19:46.80 --> 01:19:48.40 You better look squared away.
01:19:48.40 --> 01:19:49.40 Yes.
01:19:49.40 --> 01:19:50.40 About 100%.
01:19:50.40 --> 01:19:51.40 Oh, the time.
01:19:51.40 --> 01:19:53.04 Where do you not want to look squared away?
01:19:53.04 --> 01:19:57.08 And look, if you got long-term plans and you want to build a team and you got long-term
01:19:57.08 --> 01:20:01.04 plans of having a good team around you, start early.
01:20:01.04 --> 01:20:05.80 I remember joining my first quadrant and there is the training officer bill.
01:20:05.80 --> 01:20:06.80 It's called the training officer.
01:20:06.80 --> 01:20:09.56 It's like the senior of the junior officers.
01:20:09.56 --> 01:20:13.44 So it's like kind of like that's elevated himself amongst all the junior pilots that's kind
01:20:13.44 --> 01:20:15.24 of an a key leadership role.
01:20:15.24 --> 01:20:18.88 And I remember seeing a training and you see a squared away training officer like I want
01:20:18.88 --> 01:20:19.88 to be like that guy.
01:20:19.88 --> 01:20:22.20 And then that training officer would go away and then a couple of years later he'd come
01:20:22.20 --> 01:20:27.48 back to a squadron and he'd be the ops officer, which is like a senior of the middle guys.
01:20:27.48 --> 01:20:29.36 And he'd be squared away by the time.
01:20:29.36 --> 01:20:33.64 And this guy that that I worked with in my squadron, by the time that guy came back to be
01:20:33.64 --> 01:20:38.40 a squadron commander who had been squared away from day one, dudes are running down to
01:20:38.40 --> 01:20:41.72 headquarters with cases of very like I want to get in this guy's squadron.
01:20:41.72 --> 01:20:44.72 People were fighting to get into his unit.
01:20:44.72 --> 01:20:46.08 Was that because he was nice?
01:20:46.08 --> 01:20:47.08 Yeah.
01:20:47.08 --> 01:20:48.84 Was that because he gave people extra liberty?
01:20:48.84 --> 01:20:53.32 Because he was squared away and he held the line and we all wanted to be like him.
01:20:53.32 --> 01:20:56.32 And he didn't like wake up one day like, oh, I'm a commander now.
01:20:56.32 --> 01:20:58.08 I guess I got to square myself away.
01:20:58.08 --> 01:20:59.08 He'd been like that forever.
01:20:59.08 --> 01:21:01.28 Dude's were fighting to get in his unit.
01:21:01.28 --> 01:21:04.72 You know, I was talking about leadership capital the other day on EF online because somebody
01:21:04.72 --> 01:21:06.04 asked a question about it.
01:21:06.04 --> 01:21:14.64 And one of the things is your reputation can contain a positive bank account of leadership
01:21:14.64 --> 01:21:15.64 capital.
01:21:15.64 --> 01:21:16.64 Yeah.
01:21:16.64 --> 01:21:20.48 It can also contain a negative bank account of leadership capital.
01:21:20.48 --> 01:21:24.04 And if you're not, if you just decide that you're going to get squared away when you're
01:21:24.04 --> 01:21:26.84 putting charge, if that's when you make that decision, you're rolling in there with all kinds
01:21:26.84 --> 01:21:28.32 of negative bank account.
01:21:28.32 --> 01:21:30.04 It's a disaster.
01:21:30.04 --> 01:21:31.04 You're with people.
01:21:31.04 --> 01:21:34.28 You don't even know your reputation expense well beyond the people that you hang out
01:21:34.28 --> 01:21:35.28 with.
01:21:35.28 --> 01:21:36.28 Oh, for sure.
01:21:36.28 --> 01:21:38.12 In these communities, people know you have heard of you.
01:21:38.12 --> 01:21:42.000 People are going to run towards you or avoid you and you don't even know who they are.
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.48 And it's all going to be based on your account with them.
01:21:45.48 --> 01:21:47.92 How much leadership capital you've built.
01:21:47.92 --> 01:21:51.40 And it goes well beyond the sphere that you think you're part of.
01:21:51.40 --> 01:21:56.08 Everybody knows you in those leadership roles and they're watching you.
01:21:56.08 --> 01:21:57.08 Back to the book.
01:21:57.08 --> 01:21:59.92 And then have no further respect for him.
01:21:59.92 --> 01:22:04.52 This is for the guy that that behaves and conduct, unbecoming of an officer.
01:22:04.52 --> 01:22:10.44 The enlistment have no further respect for him and he can no longer lead or command effectively.
01:22:10.44 --> 01:22:14.88 His value to his unit's laundry been distraught when an officer accepts his commission.
01:22:14.88 --> 01:22:18.88 He is presumed to have had enough experience to have acquired the ethical and moral
01:22:18.88 --> 01:22:21.72 precepts expected of an officer in a gentleman.
01:22:21.72 --> 01:22:27.44 The record of long services not an excuse for laxity in this matter.
01:22:27.44 --> 01:22:30.12 Damn, he's coming off the top of the right there.
01:22:30.12 --> 01:22:36.12 I just put myself in mental check for my whole life.
01:22:36.12 --> 01:22:43.20 Too often incidents are brought to my attention involving the intent of use of alcohol.
01:22:43.20 --> 01:22:46.52 Drunk and miss at any time in place is disgraceful.
01:22:46.52 --> 01:22:55.24 When combined with the operation of a motor vehicle, it becomes a potential killer.
01:22:55.24 --> 01:22:56.68 Drunk driving didn't used to be a thing.
01:22:56.68 --> 01:22:57.68 Do you know that?
01:22:57.68 --> 01:23:00.76 Yeah, I'm driving didn't used to be a fail.
01:23:00.76 --> 01:23:04.72 It was a badge of honor back in the day on some units.
01:23:04.72 --> 01:23:15.72 When my dad crashed a car drunk in like 1955 or something and the cop like pulled his car
01:23:15.72 --> 01:23:16.72 out the camera right home.
01:23:16.72 --> 01:23:21.64 I mean, my dad was like, whatever, 19 or something.
01:23:21.64 --> 01:23:26.96 And I got hit by a drunk driver when I was kid on a bicycle.
01:23:26.96 --> 01:23:28.84 And I got hit by a drunk driver.
01:23:28.84 --> 01:23:30.28 I got thrown off my bike.
01:23:30.28 --> 01:23:33.72 I had to get stitches in my head.
01:23:33.72 --> 01:23:39.64 And my dad was like, oh yeah, it was almost like, it was almost like, well, you know,
01:23:39.64 --> 01:23:42.48 you had a little too much drink, no, no factor.
01:23:42.48 --> 01:23:45.72 But kiddo, we all right, can we get some money for a new bike because the bike was
01:23:45.72 --> 01:23:46.72 trashed.
01:23:46.72 --> 01:23:51.12 Nowadays, that would be game over for that guy's whole life, right?
01:23:51.12 --> 01:23:53.60 That'd be going to put, would you go to jail for that?
01:23:53.60 --> 01:23:57.32 If you hit a kid on a bike while you're drunk, I would say like no question.
01:23:57.32 --> 01:23:59.40 We'd be going jail, right?
01:23:59.40 --> 01:24:04.28 So it's pretty interesting that way back then he's saying when combined with the operation
01:24:04.28 --> 01:24:05.92 of motor vehicle, it becomes a potential killer.
01:24:05.92 --> 01:24:08.32 Yeah, he's way out in front of the curve here.
01:24:08.32 --> 01:24:11.88 This is someone who's probably spent way more time thinking about that type of character
01:24:11.88 --> 01:24:14.28 than others because back then that wasn't a thing.
01:24:14.28 --> 01:24:18.44 Yeah, you want to know why he's probably gone to visit all of a bunch of guys in the
01:24:18.44 --> 01:24:22.40 hospital that had drunk driving accidents and repaired, you know, had jeeps, had to write off
01:24:22.40 --> 01:24:25.56 jeeps and trucks and whatever else.
01:24:25.56 --> 01:24:29.24 These results are not only detrimental to the individual, but also to the service, particularly
01:24:29.24 --> 01:24:32.60 in overseas commands, commanders at all levels must continually take aggressive action
01:24:32.60 --> 01:24:37.44 who do successive drinking and prevent drunk and driving.
01:24:37.44 --> 01:24:47.36 Long time ago, again, officers are expected to set the example.
01:24:47.36 --> 01:24:52.40 The officer's code, Armyungi Regulation's provide that an officer's signature is in itself
01:24:52.40 --> 01:24:54.04 a certification.
01:24:54.04 --> 01:24:55.76 His signature is his bond.
01:24:55.76 --> 01:25:02.32 A requirement is that an officer is so to conduct himself that he is deserving of such
01:25:02.32 --> 01:25:04.32 trust.
01:25:04.32 --> 01:25:07.84 The appropriate administrative and disciplinary action must be taken against officers who
01:25:07.84 --> 01:25:11.92 are guilty of misconduct and unwilling to live within proper code.
01:25:11.92 --> 01:25:16.24 The officer and officer cannot expect to retain his standing and prestige as an officer
01:25:16.24 --> 01:25:21.24 where he is inefficient or guilty of becoming conduct.
01:25:21.24 --> 01:25:26.88 Each officer must clothe himself with such a scale of values that he knows instinctively
01:25:26.88 --> 01:25:31.48 the things that an officer does not do.
01:25:31.48 --> 01:25:35.96 The officer's code does not get less binding as he goes up and rank.
01:25:35.96 --> 01:25:37.40 The opposite is true.
01:25:37.40 --> 01:25:40.40 It becomes more binding.
01:25:40.40 --> 01:25:44.52 Dude, this dude is holding the line big time.
01:25:44.52 --> 01:25:48.68 I'm feeling like nervous.
01:25:48.68 --> 01:25:56.76 As I always have to point out, I was a young wild frog man.
01:25:56.76 --> 01:26:06.92 I did not come close to achieving these standards.
01:26:06.92 --> 01:26:11.24 I would have loved to have read this book when I was 18, 19, 20.
01:26:11.24 --> 01:26:17.68 I would have loved to have this people that were telling me, hey bro, this is the path.
01:26:17.68 --> 01:26:18.68 This is it.
01:26:18.68 --> 01:26:20.36 This is what you want to do.
01:26:20.36 --> 01:26:21.36 And you know what?
01:26:21.36 --> 01:26:22.36 It takes to be able to do that.
01:26:22.36 --> 01:26:26.72 Here's the reality.
01:26:26.72 --> 01:26:28.28 For me to say, hey, you know what?
01:26:28.28 --> 01:26:31.60 I made mistakes and I do not want you to make them.
01:26:31.60 --> 01:26:34.32 I want you to be better than me.
01:26:34.32 --> 01:26:36.84 I want you to be better than I am.
01:26:36.84 --> 01:26:40.92 I want you're the end state of your life.
01:26:40.92 --> 01:26:45.60 I want to be superior to mine.
01:26:45.60 --> 01:26:49.28 That's what drives giving this kind of advice.
01:26:49.28 --> 01:26:56.32 Hey, listen, I want the end state of your life to be superior to mine.
01:26:56.32 --> 01:27:00.32 That's what we should be thinking when we interact with other people.
01:27:00.32 --> 01:27:03.76 We shouldn't have that little thing in the back of our minds at saying, you know what?
01:27:03.76 --> 01:27:05.04 I had to do this.
01:27:05.04 --> 01:27:07.76 I had to learn the hard way.
01:27:07.76 --> 01:27:10.000 I wish I would have done that, but I'd known told me to do that.
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.48 Why should I tell him?
01:27:14.48 --> 01:27:15.48 What do you got?
01:27:15.48 --> 01:27:16.48 Just wrote it down.
01:27:16.48 --> 01:27:17.48 Because that's a good one.
01:27:17.48 --> 01:27:19.76 That's leadership.
01:27:19.76 --> 01:27:20.76 Yeah.
01:27:20.76 --> 01:27:21.76 Yeah.
01:27:21.76 --> 01:27:23.76 Crazy.
01:27:23.76 --> 01:27:32.76 I was recently invited to the US Army Command and General Staff College to address the
01:27:32.76 --> 01:27:37.000 faculty and students on the subject of command or ship and general ship.
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.08 Following my talk, I was asked to comment on the problem of integrity versus professional
01:27:41.08 --> 01:27:47.80 loyalty when an officer is confronted with orders with which he has a strong disagreement.
01:27:47.80 --> 01:27:50.000 I answered by citing two examples of my experience.
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.48 Once, while I could that, I asked a tactical officer a similar question.
01:27:54.48 --> 01:27:59.92 His answer was to carry out the order loyally and then when you are in a tenable position
01:27:59.92 --> 01:28:02.32 to recommend changes if warranted.
01:28:02.32 --> 01:28:03.88 I have followed this with good results.
01:28:03.88 --> 01:28:05.32 So there's your first answer.
01:28:05.32 --> 01:28:08.64 Hey, you know, I asked Dave to do something that you don't agree with.
01:28:08.64 --> 01:28:10.04 What should you do?
01:28:10.04 --> 01:28:12.000 Well, you should carry it out and then you should pull me aside.
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.92 When you can soon get a chance to go, hey, General, this doesn't seem like it's a good idea.
01:28:14.92 --> 01:28:16.32 Me here's why.
01:28:16.32 --> 01:28:17.32 Good.
01:28:17.32 --> 01:28:18.32 Got that.
01:28:18.32 --> 01:28:21.28 This is a longer example.
01:28:21.28 --> 01:28:28.04 In another instance, when I was a commanding general of the US Continental Army Command, we
01:28:28.04 --> 01:28:32.96 were charged with the service testing of an expensive and important piece of Army equipment.
01:28:32.96 --> 01:28:38.04 This was important enough to assign my deputy, a lieutenant general to monitor closely.
01:28:38.04 --> 01:28:39.72 The test went on for several weeks.
01:28:39.72 --> 01:28:43.44 One day, my deputy reported to me that the piece of equipment was not proving outside
01:28:43.44 --> 01:28:45.000 as factually.
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.64 He was fully convinced of his position.
01:28:47.64 --> 01:28:51.72 I told him how serious and how sensitive such a finding would be.
01:28:51.72 --> 01:28:57.72 I directed that he called in several officers closely concerned with the test for a conference
01:28:57.72 --> 01:28:58.72 with me.
01:28:58.72 --> 01:29:02.28 This was done in all were unanimous supporting the position of my deputy.
01:29:02.28 --> 01:29:04.68 They had beta and results supporting them.
01:29:04.68 --> 01:29:06.28 So they're supposed to test his piece of gear.
01:29:06.28 --> 01:29:08.72 There's a, it sounds like there's an expected outcome.
01:29:08.72 --> 01:29:10.64 It wasn't turned out that way.
01:29:10.64 --> 01:29:15.24 I directed that they prepare a personal letter for my signature.
01:29:15.24 --> 01:29:19.84 The chief of staff of the army or for my signature for the chief of staff of the army
01:29:19.84 --> 01:29:25.72 setting forth their findings and conclusions with supporting data and information.
01:29:25.72 --> 01:29:30.40 After proving and signing it, I had my aid delivered by hand to the chief of staff.
01:29:30.40 --> 01:29:33.24 Within 48 hours, I had a phone call from the chief of staff.
01:29:33.24 --> 01:29:34.96 He was disturbed.
01:29:34.96 --> 01:29:37.32 He told me how serious this was.
01:29:37.32 --> 01:29:42.08 How important the equipment was and how not only the United States, but an allied power
01:29:42.08 --> 01:29:44.32 was interested in it.
01:29:44.32 --> 01:29:49.68 He wanted us to take a positive approach and proceed with the program.
01:29:49.68 --> 01:29:51.16 My reply, so there you go.
01:29:51.16 --> 01:29:53.24 He wrote, hey, there's the problems, these are the shortfalls.
01:29:53.24 --> 01:29:54.48 That's what we all agree on.
01:29:54.48 --> 01:29:56.36 I'm letting you know.
01:29:56.36 --> 01:30:01.68 And his boss says, hey, this is an interesting terminology.
01:30:01.68 --> 01:30:08.12 I want you to take a positive approach and proceed.
01:30:08.12 --> 01:30:10.08 Take a positive approach and proceed.
01:30:10.08 --> 01:30:17.92 So to me, I translate that as a lean towards making this work.
01:30:17.92 --> 01:30:22.44 My reply was that I felt I owed him the loyalty to bring the facts as I believe them
01:30:22.44 --> 01:30:28.92 to his attention and having done that, I was prepared to carry out fully his further instructions.
01:30:28.92 --> 01:30:34.12 The morals of this true story are the chief of staff was in a position to, now this is important.
01:30:34.12 --> 01:30:39.28 The chief of staff was in a position to know of considerations and factors of the
01:30:39.28 --> 01:30:44.88 higher highest importance, which I could not know.
01:30:44.88 --> 01:30:49.84 Now where I think this is, if Dave comes to me and says, hey, I object to this or I got
01:30:49.84 --> 01:30:50.84 the issue.
01:30:50.84 --> 01:30:53.28 My response, hey, Dave, here's what's going on, man.
01:30:53.28 --> 01:30:55.24 Here's why this is important, here's what's happening.
01:30:55.24 --> 01:30:56.40 I would tell you why.
01:30:56.40 --> 01:30:58.000 Here's some things you see that I don't see.
01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.36 Here's some things you know, I need to know.
01:30:59.36 --> 01:31:00.36 Yep.
01:31:00.36 --> 01:31:01.64 Yep.
01:31:01.64 --> 01:31:07.60 I had satisfied both my integrity and professional loyalty as well as my duty to my superior.
01:31:07.60 --> 01:31:11.92 I was now free to proceed without compromise on my part.
01:31:11.92 --> 01:31:17.68 To take a negative or I told you so attitude would not have been becoming to a member
01:31:17.68 --> 01:31:22.000 of the team, all members of which were dedicated to doing their best for the army and their
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000 country.
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:29.08 So, I wrote about this in leadership strategy and tactics, almost that nausea.
01:31:29.08 --> 01:31:31.84 But there's so many different ways to talk about it.
01:31:31.84 --> 01:31:40.000 And I even want that I cite all the time is the band of brothers, Dick Winters, totally.
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000 Yep.
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000 You do the recon.
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000 Someone gets killed.
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.72 The war is literally within days of ending.
01:31:44.72 --> 01:31:45.72 You do a recon.
01:31:45.72 --> 01:31:46.72 Someone gets killed.
01:31:46.72 --> 01:31:47.72 You come back.
01:31:47.72 --> 01:31:50.80 You get told to do another recon the next night and you say, got it boss.
01:31:50.80 --> 01:31:54.96 And then you go have the guys drink wine and a seller and you don't do the recon.
01:31:54.96 --> 01:31:56.96 Is that a good call?
01:31:56.96 --> 01:31:57.96 Yep.
01:31:57.96 --> 01:31:59.96 Is it supporting the chain of command?
01:31:59.96 --> 01:32:00.96 Nope.
01:32:00.96 --> 01:32:01.96 Did it protect the guys?
01:32:01.96 --> 01:32:03.96 Yes, did it accomplish the mission?
01:32:03.96 --> 01:32:04.96 Yes.
01:32:04.96 --> 01:32:07.96 Could he have argued it a little bit and I forget from the movie what how they showed it?
01:32:07.96 --> 01:32:08.96 I think he pushed back.
01:32:08.96 --> 01:32:10.64 He definitely pushed back.
01:32:10.64 --> 01:32:14.84 But a certain point pushing back would have just gotten fired and then guess what?
01:32:14.84 --> 01:32:15.84 Then they're going on the patrol.
01:32:15.84 --> 01:32:17.28 Then they're going on the patrol with the Yes man.
01:32:17.28 --> 01:32:18.28 With the Yes man.
01:32:18.28 --> 01:32:19.28 Yep.
01:32:19.28 --> 01:32:20.28 For sure.
01:32:20.28 --> 01:32:23.60 And as you're building, as the story is building up, there's a little part of me too.
01:32:23.60 --> 01:32:26.24 But I think a people listening like, so he's already done that.
01:32:26.24 --> 01:32:28.72 He's going to now hold the line.
01:32:28.72 --> 01:32:33.56 This or I cannot in good conscious put this in a positive light.
01:32:33.56 --> 01:32:34.56 Cool.
01:32:34.56 --> 01:32:36.64 I'll find somebody who can.
01:32:36.64 --> 01:32:39.76 And there's a part in there, the humility that it takes.
01:32:39.76 --> 01:32:43.60 He's a four star general in this case to go, you know what?
01:32:43.60 --> 01:32:44.60 The chief of staff knows something.
01:32:44.60 --> 01:32:45.60 I don't know.
01:32:45.60 --> 01:32:46.88 He sees something I don't see.
01:32:46.88 --> 01:32:49.96 Can I consider that and try to go out and go, hey, I tell you what.
01:32:49.96 --> 01:32:52.76 There's some place over who this piece of equipment actually does work pretty well.
01:32:52.76 --> 01:32:53.76 Maybe not here or here.
01:32:53.76 --> 01:32:54.76 But here's some positive.
01:32:54.76 --> 01:32:55.76 Can I do that?
01:32:55.76 --> 01:32:56.92 Yeah, it takes a ton of humility.
01:32:56.92 --> 01:33:01.32 But if you don't do that, the influence you lose to actually provide the outcome that
01:33:01.32 --> 01:33:06.48 you want, which is exactly what you're saying, think about the humility it takes to go,
01:33:06.48 --> 01:33:09.04 maybe I don't have the whole picture.
01:33:09.04 --> 01:33:12.04 And this, I'm going to dig my heels in a hole in the line because it's the right thing
01:33:12.04 --> 01:33:13.04 to do.
01:33:13.04 --> 01:33:14.32 Maybe I actually don't even know the whole story.
01:33:14.32 --> 01:33:15.32 Cool.
01:33:15.32 --> 01:33:16.32 You're fired.
01:33:16.32 --> 01:33:17.32 Right.
01:33:17.32 --> 01:33:18.32 Yep.
01:33:18.32 --> 01:33:18.32 See you later.
01:33:18.32 --> 01:33:20.44 And I'll get a yes man in there and he's going to give me whatever I want for report.
01:33:20.44 --> 01:33:21.44 And that's that.
01:33:21.44 --> 01:33:22.44 Yeah.
01:33:22.44 --> 01:33:24.08 So good.
01:33:24.08 --> 01:33:28.52 Next section.
01:33:28.52 --> 01:33:33.16 And this is chapter four, prestige of the non-commissioned officer.
01:33:33.16 --> 01:33:37.32 And again, once again, I sort of said, well, maybe we don't need to cover this.
01:33:37.32 --> 01:33:39.84 And then as I read through it, I realized what this is talking about.
01:33:39.84 --> 01:33:45.36 And this is talking about something that I've referred to quite a bit on EF online lately.
01:33:45.36 --> 01:33:50.96 So if you think about it from this perspective, it starts to make a lot of sense way beyond
01:33:50.96 --> 01:33:51.96 the military.
01:33:51.96 --> 01:33:56.36 That is respect, respect.
01:33:56.36 --> 01:33:58.32 So prestige of the non-commissioned officer.
01:33:58.32 --> 01:34:02.76 So if you think about this from perspective of how do you respect people, how important
01:34:02.76 --> 01:34:03.76 that is?
01:34:03.76 --> 01:34:05.56 Because that's what he's talking about.
01:34:05.56 --> 01:34:09.60 Continuing on, advances in weapon systems over the past few years have forced many
01:34:09.60 --> 01:34:13.16 changes in our tactile organization and operational concepts.
01:34:13.16 --> 01:34:18.88 The keynotes of our modern army, our mobility, dispersion and small, small, and operations.
01:34:18.88 --> 01:34:24.68 This concept coupled with the many new tools of war requires greater reliance than ever before
01:34:24.68 --> 01:34:26.44 on our non-commissioned officers.
01:34:26.44 --> 01:34:27.44 What do we talk about?
01:34:27.44 --> 01:34:28.44 We're talking about front line leaders.
01:34:28.44 --> 01:34:31.04 So if you're in civilian world, we're talking about front line leaders.
01:34:31.04 --> 01:34:32.04 And guess what?
01:34:32.04 --> 01:34:36.28 This guy was in World War I and in World War I, there was not a bunch of reliance.
01:34:36.28 --> 01:34:38.64 There was not dispersion, meaning everyone was together.
01:34:38.64 --> 01:34:43.32 You're in a big trench, you're all together when the trumpet blows or the whistle sounds
01:34:43.32 --> 01:34:45.32 or the signal comes.
01:34:45.32 --> 01:34:46.32 We're all going at once.
01:34:46.32 --> 01:34:47.32 We're going to go over the top.
01:34:47.32 --> 01:34:48.84 We're going to charge.
01:34:48.84 --> 01:34:53.48 And with hundreds and hundreds of men at the same time, there's no dispersion.
01:34:53.48 --> 01:34:54.88 We're all close together.
01:34:54.88 --> 01:34:57.12 It's not small unit operations.
01:34:57.12 --> 01:34:58.12 And we're not moving.
01:34:58.12 --> 01:34:59.12 So he saw that.
01:34:59.12 --> 01:35:01.76 And we're, look, he says mobility, dispersion, and small unit operations.
01:35:01.76 --> 01:35:02.92 What was World War I?
01:35:02.92 --> 01:35:04.08 It was not mobile.
01:35:04.08 --> 01:35:05.32 It was not dispersed.
01:35:05.32 --> 01:35:07.48 And it was not small unit operations.
01:35:07.48 --> 01:35:11.68 By the time he gets to Korea and then he gets to World War II or sorry World War II and then
01:35:11.68 --> 01:35:12.84 Korea, it's totally different.
01:35:12.84 --> 01:35:16.64 And now he realizes the importance of the front line leaders.
01:35:16.64 --> 01:35:19.76 So how do we rely on these front line leaders?
01:35:19.76 --> 01:35:23.44 So if you're thinking about your front line leaders, here's what you need to do.
01:35:23.44 --> 01:35:27.56 Fully developed the non-commissioned officer to fulfill his role, a commander must place
01:35:27.56 --> 01:35:32.96 with responsibility on him and permit him to assume his place in command.
01:35:32.96 --> 01:35:35.84 You have to give them ownership.
01:35:35.84 --> 01:35:39.92 In doing this, standards of performance need not be lowered.
01:35:39.92 --> 01:35:46.08 Honest errors must be expected and tolerated but corrected.
01:35:46.08 --> 01:35:51.12 When your personnel must not use SERP responsibilities which provide the experience needed
01:35:51.12 --> 01:35:53.68 in developing our junior leaders.
01:35:53.68 --> 01:35:55.08 Don't be the Esman.
01:35:55.08 --> 01:35:56.08 Don't be the easy button.
01:35:56.08 --> 01:35:59.40 Sorry, don't be the easy button.
01:35:59.40 --> 01:36:03.48 Emphasis should be placed on the non-commissioned officer's role.
01:36:03.48 --> 01:36:08.28 Leader, trainer, supervisor.
01:36:08.28 --> 01:36:09.28 Leader, trainer, supervisor.
01:36:09.28 --> 01:36:14.84 This goes back to the developing the echelon front certification program.
01:36:14.84 --> 01:36:18.56 Think about this leader, trainer, supervisor.
01:36:18.56 --> 01:36:21.16 He's got them all mixed in like we eventually got to.
01:36:21.16 --> 01:36:23.60 I didn't have this book and we were starting to develop the program.
01:36:23.60 --> 01:36:27.32 Now that I have it, I'm super stoked that we came to the same conclusion.
01:36:27.32 --> 01:36:31.60 And that is that a leader, a trainer, a supervisor, a manager and instructor.
01:36:31.60 --> 01:36:35.72 They're all qualities that are needed as you come up the chain of command if you're going
01:36:35.72 --> 01:36:39.08 to be in charge of people.
01:36:39.08 --> 01:36:45.24 There follows a list of suggested actions that may be taken each by each commissioned officer
01:36:45.24 --> 01:36:50.44 at all levels of command to further the efficiency and enhance the stature of the non-commissioned
01:36:50.44 --> 01:36:52.64 officer corps.
01:36:52.64 --> 01:36:55.40 Again, how do we respect our frontline leaders?
01:36:55.40 --> 01:36:59.88 Because the more respect we give them, the more respect they're going to give us, the
01:36:59.88 --> 01:37:06.12 more ownership we give them, the more ownership they're going to take.
01:37:06.12 --> 01:37:08.04 Affordy.
01:37:08.04 --> 01:37:15.04 To prevent the use of non-commissioned officers for menial and degrading tasks.
01:37:15.04 --> 01:37:16.20 Okay.
01:37:16.20 --> 01:37:20.56 Ensure that non-commissioned officers are consistently addressed by their rank.
01:37:20.56 --> 01:37:24.76 So you're giving them that respect.
01:37:24.76 --> 01:37:27.92 At here to the chain of command through non-commissioned officer ranks, right?
01:37:27.92 --> 01:37:31.72 So you don't jump down to the front line and start talking them without talking to that
01:37:31.72 --> 01:37:34.92 front line leader.
01:37:34.92 --> 01:37:40.36 Use requirements for officer supervision or mandatory presence at troop formations.
01:37:40.36 --> 01:37:42.48 Let the non-commissioned officer take charge.
01:37:42.48 --> 01:37:46.60 Give them ownership.
01:37:46.60 --> 01:37:50.48 Sometimes for those of you that don't watch the Sun YouTube, when Dave just fully agrees
01:37:50.48 --> 01:37:53.28 with something, he doesn't not as head-yes.
01:37:53.28 --> 01:37:54.72 He shakes his head no.
01:37:54.72 --> 01:37:59.56 As if to say this is just no disputing this at all.
01:37:59.56 --> 01:38:03.76 Avoid mass withdrawal of non-commissioned officer privileges but take positive action against
01:38:03.76 --> 01:38:08.20 individual concerns so don't do collective punitive actions.
01:38:08.20 --> 01:38:13.52 When appropriate, permit key non-commissioned officers to attend staff conferences and commanders
01:38:13.52 --> 01:38:14.52 briefings.
01:38:14.52 --> 01:38:15.52 Hello.
01:38:15.52 --> 01:38:20.48 Take that front line leader, bring him into your higher level meetings, let them see what's
01:38:20.48 --> 01:38:23.60 going on.
01:38:23.60 --> 01:38:28.60 Ensure that deserving high-quality non-commissioned officers are commended for outstanding
01:38:28.60 --> 01:38:34.08 performance of duty by awarding them, combination ribbons, letters of appreciation or
01:38:34.08 --> 01:38:39.36 commendation or certificates of achievement or, and this is Jocco's edition, give them
01:38:39.36 --> 01:38:44.04 more responsibility, give them more ownership.
01:38:44.04 --> 01:38:51.88 Refrain from over supervising the non-commissioned officer after a task has been assigned.
01:38:51.88 --> 01:38:59.60 No micromanage, issue mission type instructions rather than detailed orders.
01:38:59.60 --> 01:39:04.08 I haven't said that yet on this podcast but when I read these things, I feel like I
01:39:04.08 --> 01:39:06.60 owe this guy money.
01:39:06.60 --> 01:39:09.88 Whenever possible, place senior non-commissioned officers under the supervision of Commissioner
01:39:09.88 --> 01:39:14.88 War Officers, inform non-commissioned officers in advance of significant matters pertaining
01:39:14.88 --> 01:39:18.88 to the units such as maneuvers, field problems, training requirements, disciplinary matters,
01:39:18.88 --> 01:39:23.48 standards to avoid unfounded rumors and allow for necessary advance planning at all
01:39:23.48 --> 01:39:26.08 echelons.
01:39:26.08 --> 01:39:28.76 Does it make sense that you keep your unit informed?
01:39:28.76 --> 01:39:33.60 You keep your front line leaders informed?
01:39:33.60 --> 01:39:35.68 What do you think they do when you don't tell them what's happening?
01:39:35.68 --> 01:39:39.80 Do you think they just sit there and silently wait a wait your word?
01:39:39.80 --> 01:39:40.80 No, they make shit up.
01:39:40.80 --> 01:39:45.92 Make it up, yep.
01:39:45.92 --> 01:39:46.92 Is there more?
01:39:46.92 --> 01:39:49.20 This is ridiculous how good this is.
01:39:49.20 --> 01:39:50.84 Grant, non-commissioned officers.
01:39:50.84 --> 01:39:53.92 Again, if you're listening to this and you're not in the military, just replace this with
01:39:53.92 --> 01:39:55.80 your front line leaders.
01:39:55.80 --> 01:40:00.60 Grant, front line leaders, a greater voice in allowing privileges or awards or warning
01:40:00.60 --> 01:40:02.72 punishment.
01:40:02.72 --> 01:40:10.44 Consult with them on matters involving the reclassification and promotion of their subordinates.
01:40:10.44 --> 01:40:13.04 Let it be known that they greatly influence these matters.
01:40:13.04 --> 01:40:19.16 This whole thing is about giving way of responsibility and giving way of ownership.
01:40:19.16 --> 01:40:25.24 Use senior non-commission officers to assist in conducting inspections and ensure distribution
01:40:25.24 --> 01:40:30.80 of directives to non-commission officers so that they may have current information on military
01:40:30.80 --> 01:40:32.44 matters.
01:40:32.44 --> 01:40:39.60 Keep your front line leaders informed.
01:40:39.60 --> 01:40:47.36 Use senior non-commission officers as instructors, back the actions of non-commission officers
01:40:47.36 --> 01:40:53.64 publicly refer to them as non-commission officers, not as NCOs or non-comps, which are two
01:40:53.64 --> 01:40:55.64 slang terms which I do all the time.
01:40:55.64 --> 01:40:57.48 NCOs, non-comps.
01:40:57.48 --> 01:41:01.84 He's saying, give them that and look, it's a little slang term.
01:41:01.84 --> 01:41:03.84 Give them that respect.
01:41:03.84 --> 01:41:07.48 Yeah, the title is, is the prestige of the non-commission officer.
01:41:07.48 --> 01:41:09.48 I mean, that's what he's talking about.
01:41:09.48 --> 01:41:16.60 I mean, that was just a recipe for leadership right there and like I said, these are your supervisors.
01:41:16.60 --> 01:41:20.68 These are your front line supervisors whose management is of the people right at the point
01:41:20.68 --> 01:41:23.20 of friction, the ones doing the work.
01:41:23.20 --> 01:41:27.28 So these are your first line supervisors and second line supervisors closest to your people
01:41:27.28 --> 01:41:29.44 out there making it happen.
01:41:29.44 --> 01:41:34.76 And if you want them to respect you, you gotta give them respect.
01:41:34.76 --> 01:41:37.36 If you want them to trust you, you have to trust them.
01:41:37.36 --> 01:41:44.36 And if you want them to lead, like you gotta let them lead in every single time, you take
01:41:44.36 --> 01:41:46.08 responsibility away from them.
01:41:46.08 --> 01:41:50.24 He said in the beginning, you gotta expect them to make mistakes and make errors.
01:41:50.24 --> 01:41:51.76 You don't ignore it.
01:41:51.76 --> 01:41:52.76 You correct it.
01:41:52.76 --> 01:41:54.40 But you don't take responsibility away from them.
01:41:54.40 --> 01:41:58.20 If I take, if you do something that's not what I want, you work for me, you're one
01:41:58.20 --> 01:41:59.20 of my supervisors.
01:41:59.20 --> 01:42:01.20 You go out there and do something that's not how I wanted it.
01:42:01.20 --> 01:42:05.60 And if I take that responsibility away from you, that's me telling you, I don't trust
01:42:05.60 --> 01:42:06.60 you.
01:42:06.60 --> 01:42:11.08 So with the return on me again, that is, you don't trust me as much.
01:42:11.08 --> 01:42:12.24 That means I still gotta correct that.
01:42:12.24 --> 01:42:13.24 I gotta show you.
01:42:13.24 --> 01:42:14.04 Hey, Jockel, that's not what we're looking for.
01:42:14.04 --> 01:42:15.84 Let me talk you about why we did this in a while.
01:42:15.84 --> 01:42:16.84 Let me explain these things.
01:42:16.84 --> 01:42:18.96 But I get you right back out there to go do it.
01:42:18.96 --> 01:42:23.16 The reciprocal nature of the relationship, everything you want from them, you have to give
01:42:23.16 --> 01:42:25.52 them that it was literally a list.
01:42:25.52 --> 01:42:30.32 It is a checklist of leadership to get the behavior that you want.
01:42:30.32 --> 01:42:36.96 You and I were on a call with one of our clients the other day and it was, it was one
01:42:36.96 --> 01:42:40.16 of those questions came up and there's these four things.
01:42:40.16 --> 01:42:41.16 It's a call.
01:42:41.16 --> 01:42:43.88 Chris, he was on the call and she was quite fired up.
01:42:43.88 --> 01:42:44.88 She's awesome.
01:42:44.88 --> 01:42:45.88 She absolutely.
01:42:45.88 --> 01:42:49.64 But if you want people to listen to you, listen to them.
01:42:49.64 --> 01:42:51.76 If you want people to respect them, respect them.
01:42:51.76 --> 01:42:54.80 If you want people to respect you, you have to respect them.
01:42:54.80 --> 01:43:00.28 If you want to influence people, you have to allow them to influence you.
01:43:00.28 --> 01:43:07.08 And if you want people to trust you, you have to give them trust.
01:43:07.08 --> 01:43:10.20 Couple more things on this section, responsibilities.
01:43:10.20 --> 01:43:13.76 Insist on a thorough appreciation of the non-commissioned officers full-time responsibility
01:43:13.76 --> 01:43:18.20 to his men and to his commander.
01:43:18.20 --> 01:43:21.60 Theral appreciation.
01:43:21.60 --> 01:43:22.60 What does that mean?
01:43:22.60 --> 01:43:23.60 That means respect.
01:43:23.60 --> 01:43:28.28 A point senior non-commissioned officer counsels at each level of command starting with
01:43:28.28 --> 01:43:29.28 the batined separate.
01:43:29.28 --> 01:43:33.68 So again, this idea of creating these councils, these groups within your organization,
01:43:33.68 --> 01:43:36.96 so you can get good feedback as brilliant.
01:43:36.96 --> 01:43:40.52 Encourage non-commissioned officers, officer participation in civic affairs.
01:43:40.52 --> 01:43:41.52 Great.
01:43:41.52 --> 01:43:43.20 The last section here is education and training.
01:43:43.20 --> 01:43:47.28 This is the last thing we're going to cover.
01:43:47.28 --> 01:43:50.40 Nothing can close with prestige.
01:43:50.40 --> 01:43:55.88 A non-commissioned officer who does not know his job and does not play the part expected
01:43:55.88 --> 01:43:58.52 of him as a non-commissioned officer.
01:43:58.52 --> 01:44:01.68 Because of that, we should.
01:44:01.68 --> 01:44:06.36 One, hold classes to ensure that non-commissioned officers are thoroughly trained for their
01:44:06.36 --> 01:44:12.60 jobs and prepared to handle instructions or duties when they appear before their subordinates.
01:44:12.60 --> 01:44:14.08 What is that right there?
01:44:14.08 --> 01:44:18.000 Look, I am responsible for making sure that people below me in the chain of command are
01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.28 right or do their job totally.
01:44:21.28 --> 01:44:25.96 Number two, encourage attendance at non-commissioned officers academy and other courses
01:44:25.96 --> 01:44:33.44 designed to enhance the prestige and set the standards expected of non-commissioned officers
01:44:33.44 --> 01:44:38.64 and three encourage non-commissioned officers to take advantage of the many opportunities to increase
01:44:38.64 --> 01:44:44.52 their general level of education.
01:44:44.52 --> 01:44:48.28 And what's just amazing about this?
01:44:48.28 --> 01:44:53.20 That's just another 13 pages of this document, which is 117 pages long.
01:44:53.20 --> 01:44:57.76 We made it through another, I think we might have made it through 14 pages.
01:44:57.76 --> 01:45:02.60 But the section that closes out is to treat people with respect and give them responsibility
01:45:02.60 --> 01:45:07.72 and train them and educate them.
01:45:07.72 --> 01:45:09.20 To take care of your people.
01:45:09.20 --> 01:45:11.76 Now let's point this out.
01:45:11.76 --> 01:45:15.88 I don't care how good of a leader you are.
01:45:15.88 --> 01:45:19.76 If you don't invest in these subordinates, it doesn't matter what you do.
01:45:19.76 --> 01:45:27.000 Those front line leaders are the ones that win.
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.24 They're also the ones that lose.
01:45:30.24 --> 01:45:32.000 So invest in them.
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.48 Treat them with respect.
01:45:33.48 --> 01:45:35.28 Listen to them.
01:45:35.28 --> 01:45:38.32 Allow them to influence you.
01:45:38.32 --> 01:45:42.88 Give them trust.
01:45:42.88 --> 01:45:47.56 And I don't care what your job is or what your vocation is in life.
01:45:47.56 --> 01:45:50.000 You have to work with people.
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:55.72 Take care of those people and those people are going to take care of you.
01:45:55.72 --> 01:46:04.64 And speaking of taking care of people, Dave, I know that you know that when the aircraft
01:46:04.64 --> 01:46:09.64 cabin loses pressure, the oxygen masks drop down.
01:46:09.64 --> 01:46:12.20 And you have to take care of others.
01:46:12.20 --> 01:46:13.20 Of course.
01:46:13.20 --> 01:46:16.08 But before you take care of others, you have to take care of yourself to make sure that you
01:46:16.08 --> 01:46:23.72 have enough oxygen to live so that you can then put the oxygen masks on your children.
01:46:23.72 --> 01:46:27.12 So even though we need to take care of others and we need to take care of ourselves.
01:46:27.12 --> 01:46:30.16 First we got some ways of doing that.
01:46:30.16 --> 01:46:34.36 One of the ways is Jaco fuel, which is supplements.
01:46:34.36 --> 01:46:35.36 We got a bunch of them.
01:46:35.36 --> 01:46:37.80 We got joint warfare, acrylic oil.
01:46:37.80 --> 01:46:39.04 We got discipline, discipline, go.
01:46:39.04 --> 01:46:40.04 We got discipline with the cans.
01:46:40.04 --> 01:46:41.60 Are you on number two right now?
01:46:41.60 --> 01:46:42.60 Number two.
01:46:42.60 --> 01:46:44.56 What flavors have you torn to today?
01:46:44.56 --> 01:46:47.64 Tax average, Jaco Palmer.
01:46:47.64 --> 01:46:48.64 What's the preference?
01:46:48.64 --> 01:46:52.20 That doesn't actually count the one I had earlier today.
01:46:52.20 --> 01:46:53.20 For my get.
01:46:53.20 --> 01:46:55.92 So I guess I'm one number three.
01:46:55.92 --> 01:47:00.96 We got vitamin D, D3, Cold War.
01:47:00.96 --> 01:47:03.84 Look, there's all kinds of diseases out there.
01:47:03.84 --> 01:47:05.44 I'm not making any claims.
01:47:05.44 --> 01:47:09.48 But some of us haven't caught those diseases.
01:47:09.48 --> 01:47:10.96 So yeah, check that out.
01:47:10.96 --> 01:47:15.60 Walk or your kid, walk, adult, which is just dessert.
01:47:15.60 --> 01:47:22.40 We got, oh wait, we got a new flavor coming.
01:47:22.40 --> 01:47:25.64 It's so good.
01:47:25.64 --> 01:47:29.60 It says like allegedly we're doing it seasonal, but this thing ain't going to be seasonal.
01:47:29.60 --> 01:47:31.04 This thing is going to be all the time.
01:47:31.04 --> 01:47:32.96 It's smashing pumpkin.
01:47:32.96 --> 01:47:40.92 And I don't even know, look, I don't even know what pumpkin things are.
01:47:40.92 --> 01:47:44.76 Are supposed to taste like or whatever.
01:47:44.76 --> 01:47:46.64 But damn, this thing is good.
01:47:46.64 --> 01:47:47.64 It's so good.
01:47:47.64 --> 01:47:48.84 It's like a pumpkin.
01:47:48.84 --> 01:47:50.40 The original B little sent me.
01:47:50.40 --> 01:47:54.60 It was the generic name, the flavor name.
01:47:54.60 --> 01:47:57.08 It was pumpkin spice.
01:47:57.08 --> 01:48:01.68 And so I don't even know, I mean, you don't really eat pumpkin.
01:48:01.68 --> 01:48:02.68 Walk, right?
01:48:02.68 --> 01:48:03.48 I mean, there's a pumpkin pie.
01:48:03.48 --> 01:48:04.84 I get it.
01:48:04.84 --> 01:48:08.24 But you're not sitting around, you know, going to the store grab and a piece of pumpkin
01:48:08.24 --> 01:48:09.24 and eating it.
01:48:09.24 --> 01:48:10.24 That's not happening.
01:48:10.24 --> 01:48:11.24 Not not my house.
01:48:11.24 --> 01:48:12.24 OK.
01:48:12.24 --> 01:48:13.24 Negative.
01:48:13.24 --> 01:48:18.28 So you're not even really a hundred percent sure what pumpkin flavor is.
01:48:18.28 --> 01:48:19.28 Are you?
01:48:19.28 --> 01:48:24.32 Is anyone the only thing I think of as pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving maybe, but to be honest
01:48:24.32 --> 01:48:26.80 with you?
01:48:26.80 --> 01:48:30.68 So I don't even know what we're doing, but all I know is we created something that's
01:48:30.68 --> 01:48:31.68 a freaking tasty.
01:48:31.68 --> 01:48:37.44 It's got like a, I guess if you ever had egg nog before, yeah.
01:48:37.44 --> 01:48:41.60 It's sort of an egg nog cinnamon scenario.
01:48:41.60 --> 01:48:43.52 Sweet, just monk fruit, but it's so good.
01:48:43.52 --> 01:48:44.52 Anyways, we got that.
01:48:44.52 --> 01:48:45.72 We got that going on.
01:48:45.72 --> 01:48:46.72 All this stuff.
01:48:46.72 --> 01:48:50.64 We got chocolate, vitamin shop.
01:48:50.64 --> 01:48:52.52 You can get all this stuff at the vitamin shop.
01:48:52.52 --> 01:48:58.92 Also, if you're in Florida right now, you can get this stuff at Wawa.
01:48:58.92 --> 01:49:01.44 Coming soon, hopefully, to all Wawa's.
01:49:01.44 --> 01:49:06.52 If you're in Florida, and you want to just kind of just fall on support the cause,
01:49:06.52 --> 01:49:07.36 great.
01:49:07.36 --> 01:49:09.64 There's a good way to support the cause.
01:49:09.64 --> 01:49:13.48 Go in there and just clean them out.
01:49:13.48 --> 01:49:16.000 Go get your Wawa on.
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.88 Also, you can get this stuff at originmain.com.
01:49:17.88 --> 01:49:18.88 What do I miss?
01:49:18.88 --> 01:49:19.88 I miss anything?
01:49:19.88 --> 01:49:20.88 Nope.
01:49:20.88 --> 01:49:21.88 I'm on board with all that.
01:49:21.88 --> 01:49:24.96 I'll be, I'm actually excited about that new milk.
01:49:24.96 --> 01:49:29.24 Nobody has knocked strawberry off the top of the platform.
01:49:29.24 --> 01:49:30.24 That is still remain.
01:49:30.24 --> 01:49:31.24 So is your number two?
01:49:31.24 --> 01:49:32.24 I go to.
01:49:32.24 --> 01:49:37.04 Hey, speaking of speaking of discipline go in the can of what you've had, too.
01:49:37.04 --> 01:49:38.04 Three.
01:49:38.04 --> 01:49:39.84 Three.
01:49:39.84 --> 01:49:41.92 What flavor do you have earlier today?
01:49:41.92 --> 01:49:45.48 I had, oh, I had a second, jockel Palmer.
01:49:45.48 --> 01:49:46.48 Okay.
01:49:46.48 --> 01:49:47.48 Is that your kind of go through?
01:49:47.48 --> 01:49:49.96 No, I'll be honest with you.
01:49:49.96 --> 01:49:51.20 I drink all of them.
01:49:51.20 --> 01:49:53.80 I don't even look for flavors and more recent in the game.
01:49:53.80 --> 01:49:55.20 Dude, I'm just in the game.
01:49:55.20 --> 01:50:00.000 There is not one that I can't just be totally stoked to be drinking.
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.64 No, will there be one in the future that you'll be more stoked to be drinking?
01:50:03.64 --> 01:50:06.40 No, yeah, I think there might be.
01:50:06.40 --> 01:50:07.40 So tell us.
01:50:07.40 --> 01:50:11.56 So let's talk to us afterburner or just coming out afterburner or yeah.
01:50:11.56 --> 01:50:18.64 Dave Burke is getting his own signature flavor.
01:50:18.64 --> 01:50:23.98 It's so crazy to think that I'm getting my own signature flavor of a product that I
01:50:23.98 --> 01:50:26.92 actually already love anyway.
01:50:26.92 --> 01:50:28.32 But I'll be honest with you.
01:50:28.32 --> 01:50:35.36 When Pete and Brian at the team like, hey, bro, we would love to have you be part of this.
01:50:35.36 --> 01:50:40.64 I immediately went to my all time favorite soft drink, which I don't drink anymore,
01:50:40.64 --> 01:50:45.44 which is orange, crush or orange soda, whatever that was back when we were kids.
01:50:45.44 --> 01:50:49.44 I don't drink it, but I'll tell you, it's the best thing I've ever, I mean, as I can.
01:50:49.44 --> 01:50:52.44 You're saying you don't drink anymore because you're just not going to sit around drinking.
01:50:52.44 --> 01:50:53.44 Dude, I don't drink soda.
01:50:53.44 --> 01:50:54.68 Yeah, I don't sit around drinking orange juice.
01:50:54.68 --> 01:50:57.20 You're a human.
01:50:57.20 --> 01:51:02.40 But you don't want to have conduct unbecoming when all's just saying, I'm sucking down sugar.
01:51:02.40 --> 01:51:03.68 Negative.
01:51:03.68 --> 01:51:07.56 But I would be lying if I didn't tell you that I don't miss that flavor big time.
01:51:07.56 --> 01:51:08.76 So they were like, hey, what do you think?
01:51:08.76 --> 01:51:11.60 And it was immediate like, bro, or I love orange.
01:51:11.60 --> 01:51:15.84 And then that connection after a mirror was so easy, because who thought of after a mirror
01:51:15.84 --> 01:51:17.32 orange?
01:51:17.32 --> 01:51:18.88 I think it was me.
01:51:18.88 --> 01:51:19.88 I really do.
01:51:19.88 --> 01:51:20.88 Cool.
01:51:20.88 --> 01:51:21.88 Yeah, cool.
01:51:21.88 --> 01:51:22.88 And of course, they designed it.
01:51:22.88 --> 01:51:24.96 Wait, did you have it going into the conversation did you have it?
01:51:24.96 --> 01:51:29.84 Well, kind of like they had mentioned, hey, I think the thing was like, hey, think about
01:51:29.84 --> 01:51:30.84 it.
01:51:30.84 --> 01:51:31.84 It'd be cool to do something.
01:51:31.84 --> 01:51:34.40 The relationship with Scott Floddard.
01:51:34.40 --> 01:51:35.40 No.
01:51:35.40 --> 01:51:36.40 Just that was it.
01:51:36.40 --> 01:51:37.40 It was.
01:51:37.40 --> 01:51:38.72 Hey, you should do one.
01:51:38.72 --> 01:51:39.72 I thought about it.
01:51:39.72 --> 01:51:40.92 I said, hey, what do you think of this?
01:51:40.92 --> 01:51:42.56 And people's like, done, we're executing.
01:51:42.56 --> 01:51:46.08 And then Brian executed and it happened and it was totally good to go.
01:51:46.08 --> 01:51:47.60 Would you know when the release date is?
01:51:47.60 --> 01:51:49.24 I think it's like in the next month.
01:51:49.24 --> 01:51:50.24 I think it's next month.
01:51:50.24 --> 01:51:51.24 I think it's even.
01:51:51.24 --> 01:51:52.24 Wait, what month?
01:51:52.24 --> 01:51:53.24 No member.
01:51:53.24 --> 01:51:54.24 So it's coming out November.
01:51:54.24 --> 01:51:55.24 I think so.
01:51:55.24 --> 01:51:56.24 After burner orange, yes.
01:51:56.24 --> 01:51:59.64 The Dave Burke signature signature drink.
01:51:59.64 --> 01:52:00.64 Yeah.
01:52:00.64 --> 01:52:01.64 I'm playing on it.
01:52:01.64 --> 01:52:03.04 What kind of plane did they put on it?
01:52:03.04 --> 01:52:04.44 NF 35, silhouette.
01:52:04.44 --> 01:52:05.44 Oh, dang.
01:52:05.44 --> 01:52:06.44 Did you influence that?
01:52:06.44 --> 01:52:07.44 Maybe.
01:52:07.44 --> 01:52:12.04 She might have made sure it was the Marine Corps variant.
01:52:12.04 --> 01:52:13.44 Oh, damn.
01:52:13.44 --> 01:52:14.44 Layers.
01:52:14.44 --> 01:52:15.92 In the business, we call those layers.
01:52:15.92 --> 01:52:16.92 Absolutely.
01:52:16.92 --> 01:52:17.92 Dang.
01:52:17.92 --> 01:52:23.44 Even though when you were a charge, when you were a squadron commander, was that
01:52:23.44 --> 01:52:24.44 a Marine Corps squadron?
01:52:24.44 --> 01:52:25.44 Yes.
01:52:25.44 --> 01:52:28.04 I was a Marine Corps squadron with the Marine Corps variant of the plane.
01:52:28.04 --> 01:52:29.44 What did you do with the Air Force?
01:52:29.44 --> 01:52:31.40 You take over to Air Force squadron at some point.
01:52:31.40 --> 01:52:33.04 Air Force Division.
01:52:33.04 --> 01:52:34.24 That was the F-22 Raptor.
01:52:34.24 --> 01:52:36.76 That was a straight up Air Force Unit Air Force aircraft.
01:52:36.76 --> 01:52:39.52 I was a Marine in an Air Force squadron.
01:52:39.52 --> 01:52:42.20 Inside that squadron had a division of all these different airplanes.
01:52:42.20 --> 01:52:45.36 One was the Raptor Division and that's where I operated.
01:52:45.36 --> 01:52:46.36 Dang.
01:52:46.36 --> 01:52:47.36 Yeah.
01:52:47.36 --> 01:52:48.36 Check.
01:52:48.36 --> 01:52:49.36 All right.
01:52:49.36 --> 01:52:52.40 So we got all these cool drinks and they're good for you.
01:52:52.40 --> 01:52:55.80 Which I know it doesn't make sense because people don't understand how it can happen.
01:52:55.80 --> 01:52:57.08 I'll tell you how it can happen.
01:52:57.08 --> 01:52:58.92 You don't cut corners.
01:52:58.92 --> 01:53:07.28 You maintain the screw me on your product to make sure that it's not junk.

01:53:43.04 --> 01:53:45.04 They're freaking savage.
01:53:45.04 --> 01:53:49.36 I said one time and Pete got a big, what is it?
01:53:49.36 --> 01:53:52.40 A chuckle out of this.
01:53:52.40 --> 01:53:53.40 Which you can picture.
01:53:53.40 --> 01:53:54.40 Pete chuckling, right?
01:53:54.40 --> 01:53:56.08 He's kind of a chuckler.
01:53:56.08 --> 01:54:01.76 He was chuckling when I said that Delta jeans are the greatest thing that I've ever put
01:54:01.76 --> 01:54:05.76 on my legs.
01:54:05.76 --> 01:54:07.76 And yeah, so check out that.

01:54:10.84 --> 01:54:13.60 It's all made in America and that is what we're doing.
01:54:13.60 --> 01:54:16.32 We're bringing manufacturing back to America.

01:54:22.92 --> 01:54:24.92 Did I go name it that?
01:54:24.92 --> 01:54:25.92 Yes, he did.
01:54:25.92 --> 01:54:27.48 He legitimately did.
01:54:27.48 --> 01:54:30.56 I guess Sarah was going to take the hit on the lack of creativity.
01:54:30.56 --> 01:54:34.48 But I'm going to say echo is definitely involved in making Jockel's store.
01:54:34.48 --> 01:54:35.48 Jockel's store.com.

01:55:04.72 --> 01:55:07.76 But we talk about just pure leadership.
01:55:07.76 --> 01:55:08.76 It's a little shorter.
01:55:08.76 --> 01:55:11.88 We try and make it a little bit more concise because we know leaders are out there working.
01:55:11.88 --> 01:55:15.56 You don't always have time for a three hour podcast.
01:55:15.56 --> 01:55:16.88 Grounded podcast.

01:56:17.84 --> 01:56:24.52 I used to make fun of my publisher and say they're scared about ordering too many books.
01:56:24.52 --> 01:56:25.60 They don't know how many books to order.
01:56:25.60 --> 01:56:32.16 I'm telling them if you pre-order this, it lets me know how many books to order because
01:56:32.16 --> 01:56:36.08 this is hard to sit on a bunch of books.

01:58:21.56 --> 01:58:24.80 You don't even know what day it is that you're listening to this podcast because it's
01:58:24.80 --> 01:58:26.36 either going to be today or tomorrow.
01:58:26.36 --> 01:58:28.56 You can talk to us directly live.
01:58:28.56 --> 01:58:29.56 So come join us.
01:58:29.56 --> 01:58:30.56 What is something awesome?
01:58:30.56 --> 01:58:31.56 What is a question for Dave Burke?
01:58:31.56 --> 01:58:32.56 What should they do?
01:58:32.56 --> 01:58:34.96 They should come to efonline and ask me that question.
01:58:34.96 --> 01:58:37.28 What if they have a question for JP to not watch the day?
01:58:37.28 --> 01:58:38.28 The same thing.
01:58:38.28 --> 01:58:39.28 What if they have a question for me?
01:58:39.28 --> 01:58:42.52 What if they say, well, you know, I Twitter, I sent nine tweets to Jocco, but he
01:58:42.52 --> 01:58:45.36 an answer because he has to 80 million tweets.
01:58:45.36 --> 01:58:47.36 What should I do?
01:58:47.36 --> 01:58:48.36 Same thing.
01:58:48.36 --> 01:58:49.36 Go to efonline.
01:58:49.36 --> 01:58:50.36 It's awesome.
01:58:50.36 --> 01:58:51.36 Go to efonline.com.
01:58:51.36 --> 01:58:53.08 We have a live event.
01:58:53.08 --> 01:58:54.08 Muster 2020.
01:58:54.08 --> 01:59:00.48 As the only one we're doing in 2020, we have, this is not the first live event we're doing.
01:59:00.48 --> 01:59:01.64 We've done other live events.
01:59:01.64 --> 01:59:02.64 I know you've done some live events.
01:59:02.64 --> 01:59:04.64 I know I've done live events.
01:59:04.64 --> 01:59:06.68 Look, they're social distance.
01:59:06.68 --> 01:59:08.56 You can maintain the social distance.
01:59:08.56 --> 01:59:16.12 We'll have the appropriate measures in place so that you can come to the muster.
01:59:16.12 --> 01:59:17.12 It will be fully engaged.
01:59:17.12 --> 01:59:19.24 Look, one thing that's kind of cool.
01:59:19.24 --> 01:59:24.20 At the muster, at the previous musters before COVID, there's a thousand people there.
01:59:24.20 --> 01:59:25.52 There's 800 people there.
01:59:25.52 --> 01:59:27.72 There's 900 people there.
01:59:27.72 --> 01:59:31.32 So that means 900 people trying to talk to us during the breaks.
01:59:31.32 --> 01:59:32.32 Whatever.
01:59:32.32 --> 01:59:33.32 There's no green room.
01:59:33.32 --> 01:59:34.16 If you've never heard of the green room, we're there.
01:59:34.16 --> 01:59:35.16 We're talking.
01:59:35.16 --> 01:59:39.08 If you want to hang out with us, if you want to get some information directly from us,
01:59:39.08 --> 01:59:43.32 come to the muster, there's probably going to be a fraction.
01:59:43.32 --> 01:59:45.20 I would say there's going to be less than half.
01:59:45.20 --> 01:59:48.52 Probably going to be less than 500 people at the muster.
01:59:48.52 --> 01:59:51.04 Believe me, you spread that out over a couple of days.
01:59:51.04 --> 01:59:53.52 You're going to talk to us, ask the questions.
01:59:53.52 --> 01:59:56.92 We'll do whatever we need to do to make sure that you come away from that with the knowledge
01:59:56.92 --> 01:59:58.52 that you need.
01:59:58.52 --> 02:00:02.80 Go to extremeownership.com for details there.
02:00:02.80 --> 02:00:09.60 Of course, we have EF Overwatch if you need leadership in your team, which you do, we have
02:00:09.60 --> 02:00:15.96 we are selecting leaders from the military that understand the principles we talk about all
02:00:15.96 --> 02:00:19.76 the time and we're placing them into civilian companies into your business.
02:00:19.76 --> 02:00:24.16 Go to GFOverWatch.com if you need leaders in your company.
02:00:24.16 --> 02:00:28.76 If you want to help service members, active and retired, if you want to help their families,
02:00:28.76 --> 02:00:35.76 if you want to help gold star families around the world, then check out Mark Lee's mom.
02:00:35.76 --> 02:00:38.48 Mom and Lee, she's got a charity organization.
02:00:38.48 --> 02:00:48.08 If you want to donate or you want to get involved, then go to americasmideawereers.org.
02:00:48.08 --> 02:00:54.60 And if you look, if you just are constantly seeking that hard path and you want to do things
02:00:54.60 --> 02:01:00.20 that are tough, do things that cause you a little bit of suffering, then maybe you want
02:01:00.20 --> 02:01:06.80 more of my gutteral groans as I talk.
02:01:06.80 --> 02:01:11.52 Or maybe you want more of Dave's frothing phonetics.
02:01:11.52 --> 02:01:18.20 Well, either way, you can find us on the in a web, on Twitter, on Instagram, and on Facebook,
02:01:18.20 --> 02:01:26.12 Dave is at David R. Burke, and I am at Jocca Willink, and thanks once again to general Bruce
02:01:26.12 --> 02:01:32.72 Clark for your service to America and for leaving these lessons of leadership behind
02:01:32.72 --> 02:01:35.96 for us.
02:01:35.96 --> 02:01:42.16 And thanks to all those people in uniform out there right now that are utilizing these lessons
02:01:42.16 --> 02:01:48.92 to protect freedom in the world and to police law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics,
02:01:48.92 --> 02:01:55.32 EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, border patrol, secret service, all of the first responders.
02:01:55.32 --> 02:02:01.84 Thank you for protecting us from chaos and mayhem here at home and to everyone else,
02:02:01.84 --> 02:02:07.08 remember these lessons from general Clark.
02:02:07.08 --> 02:02:08.72 Remember the importance of time.
02:02:08.72 --> 02:02:10.72 That's where we started this whole thing today.
02:02:10.72 --> 02:02:12.88 Don't forget about that one.
02:02:12.88 --> 02:02:14.04 Remember the importance of time.
02:02:14.04 --> 02:02:15.36 The clock is ticking.
02:02:15.36 --> 02:02:17.36 Trying to anticipate problems.
02:02:17.36 --> 02:02:23.04 Be reliable, be knowledgeable, show initiative.
02:02:23.04 --> 02:02:27.96 And when you cast judgment, which I do I read these books, I think, oh, that person.
02:02:27.96 --> 02:02:29.36 I wish that person would do that.
02:02:29.36 --> 02:02:33.48 I wish that person would do the other thing.
02:02:33.48 --> 02:02:42.68 And I remember that when you cast judgment, start off by judging yourself because it all
02:02:42.68 --> 02:02:47.40 starts with you.
02:02:47.40 --> 02:03:05.32 Until next time, this is Dave and Jocco.
