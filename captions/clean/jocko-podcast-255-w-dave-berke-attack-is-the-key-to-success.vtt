00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.48
This is Jockelpontcast number 255.

2
00:00:04.48 --> 00:00:07.04
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:07.04 --> 00:00:08.04
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:08.04 --> 00:00:09.04
Good evening.

5
00:00:09.04 --> 00:00:12.48
And joining us again is Dave Burke.

6
00:00:12.48 --> 00:00:13.48
Good evening, Dave.

7
00:00:13.48 --> 00:00:14.48
Good evening.

8
00:00:14.48 --> 00:00:21.48
So we go on with guidelines for the leader and commander.

9
00:00:21.48 --> 00:00:29.000
And I think at this point, I'm not even sure that I'm just doing this purely out of my own joy.

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.12
Having searched for this book for more than a decade, finally found a copy.

11
00:00:35.12 --> 00:00:41.12
And now I'm making everyone else enjoy it with me.

12
00:00:41.12 --> 00:00:47.76
We covered this book on 251, 252, 253, 254.

13
00:00:47.76 --> 00:00:48.76
But there's a reason.

14
00:00:48.76 --> 00:00:56.16
There's a reason to dig through the past two R roots, two My roots.

15
00:00:56.16 --> 00:01:01.64
The roots from this book, from a man that served in World War I, World War II, Korea, General

16
00:01:01.64 --> 00:01:07.16
Pruskark, Bruce Clark, who then overlap that service in Korea with Colonel David Hackworth

17
00:01:07.16 --> 00:01:11.84
who served in Korea and in Vietnam and who wrote the book about face.

18
00:01:11.84 --> 00:01:16.72
These are the lessons that I learned that I tried to pass on.

19
00:01:16.72 --> 00:01:19.76
And the DNA is so clear.

20
00:01:19.76 --> 00:01:25.24
It's so clear to read this book.

21
00:01:25.24 --> 00:01:34.08
And see that DNA to find the roots of knowledge and knowing it, we learn more.

22
00:01:34.08 --> 00:01:36.000
And that's the goal.

23
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.36
The goal is to learn and improve and get better.

24
00:01:40.36 --> 00:01:46.16
So guidelines for the leader and commander by General Bruce Clark.

25
00:01:46.16 --> 00:01:48.08
Here we go.

26
00:01:48.08 --> 00:01:49.68
Back to the book.

27
00:01:49.68 --> 00:01:52.20
This next section, and I'll be honest with you.

28
00:01:52.20 --> 00:01:54.80
The last section, I liked it.

29
00:01:54.80 --> 00:01:58.52
There's some lessons that some takeaways for sure.

30
00:01:58.52 --> 00:01:59.60
This one I started getting.

31
00:01:59.60 --> 00:02:03.40
This one I had a good time with.

32
00:02:03.40 --> 00:02:07.56
And I was a little worried at first because the last section we were talking about was

33
00:02:07.56 --> 00:02:11.48
what's talking about training the individual soldier, which to me is like, okay, this

34
00:02:11.48 --> 00:02:12.48
what we're doing.

35
00:02:12.48 --> 00:02:13.96
We're talking about the individual soldier.

36
00:02:13.96 --> 00:02:19.40
I thought that might have been a little bit of a peak, a little bit of a peak where I started

37
00:02:19.40 --> 00:02:20.40
like this.

38
00:02:20.40 --> 00:02:23.88
But then I got to this section chapter 10, which is called training the unit.

39
00:02:23.88 --> 00:02:28.64
And I started saying, okay, which makes sense, right?

40
00:02:28.64 --> 00:02:30.72
Which makes sense.

41
00:02:30.72 --> 00:02:32.40
Because certainly there's going to be parallels.

42
00:02:32.40 --> 00:02:35.76
When you talk about training individual soldiers, but when you start talking about training

43
00:02:35.76 --> 00:02:41.96
teams and training units, this is where things really start to come to light from a leadership

44
00:02:41.96 --> 00:02:42.96
perspective.

45
00:02:42.96 --> 00:02:45.72
So important of unit training.

46
00:02:45.72 --> 00:02:50.32
The army's investment in the soldier pays off only when the unit is combat ready.

47
00:02:50.32 --> 00:02:55.60
So training develops combat ready units by welding skills, skilled individuals in the teams

48
00:02:55.60 --> 00:03:01.04
and combining teams into effective for tunes, companies and combined arms forces.

49
00:03:01.04 --> 00:03:05.80
It is my purpose in this chapter to highlight the application of principles and techniques

50
00:03:05.80 --> 00:03:10.84
that will contribute to improving a unit's combat readiness in less time at less cost, thus

51
00:03:10.84 --> 00:03:17.60
enabling the army to realize full measure from its investment in the soldier and as unit.

52
00:03:17.60 --> 00:03:18.84
So there you go.

53
00:03:18.84 --> 00:03:22.84
This is about training that team, getting them to work together.

54
00:03:22.84 --> 00:03:25.28
Theme of unit combat readiness.

55
00:03:25.28 --> 00:03:31.80
It has often been said that battles are fought by squads and platoons and one by teamwork

56
00:03:31.80 --> 00:03:37.84
of small units supported by fire.

57
00:03:37.84 --> 00:03:41.60
Combat power is inflicted on the enemy by fire and movement.

58
00:03:41.60 --> 00:03:42.60
There you go.

59
00:03:42.60 --> 00:03:43.60
Cover move.

60
00:03:43.60 --> 00:03:44.60
Welcome.

61
00:03:44.60 --> 00:03:47.48
It's been three paragraphs we're talking about.

62
00:03:47.48 --> 00:03:48.80
Cover move.

63
00:03:48.80 --> 00:03:53.92
This is why I started getting fired up.

64
00:03:53.92 --> 00:03:59.32
The purpose of movement is to get the fire in the most advantageous position to destroy

65
00:03:59.32 --> 00:04:00.32
the enemy.

66
00:04:00.32 --> 00:04:03.88
That's a good little thing to think about.

67
00:04:03.88 --> 00:04:06.04
That's why we cover and move.

68
00:04:06.04 --> 00:04:10.36
We cover and move to close with and destroy the enemy to get in an advantageous position to

69
00:04:10.36 --> 00:04:11.36
destroy the enemy.

70
00:04:11.36 --> 00:04:12.80
That's why we cover and move.

71
00:04:12.80 --> 00:04:16.60
One must remember however that gasoline, ammunition and other vital supplies are needed to

72
00:04:16.60 --> 00:04:18.60
sustain tactical operations.

73
00:04:18.60 --> 00:04:23.44
Accordingly, emphasis on small unit training should habitually stress teamwork to the

74
00:04:23.44 --> 00:04:28.72
point that tactical execution is accomplished with the same precision as dismounted drill

75
00:04:28.72 --> 00:04:34.12
that delivery of effective fire is as automatic as gun drill and that's supplied to the

76
00:04:34.12 --> 00:04:39.52
tactical unit is as responsive in battle as it is in Garrison.

77
00:04:39.52 --> 00:04:45.28
These battlefield reflections vividly point out the basic theme of small unit combat readiness.

78
00:04:45.28 --> 00:04:49.52
No small unit training should be undertaken in a vacuum.

79
00:04:49.52 --> 00:04:50.72
Why is he pointing this out?

80
00:04:50.72 --> 00:04:56.60
He's pointing this out because in the military it's very easy to silo yourself.

81
00:04:56.60 --> 00:05:00.04
It's very easy to say I want my platoon to be good so I'm going to go train my platoon.

82
00:05:00.04 --> 00:05:02.68
I want my company be good so I'm going to train my company.

83
00:05:02.68 --> 00:05:05.72
I want my battalion to be good so I'm just going to go train my battalion over here in

84
00:05:05.72 --> 00:05:07.12
a vacuum.

85
00:05:07.12 --> 00:05:11.08
If you're doing that you're wrong in any organization.

86
00:05:11.08 --> 00:05:15.84
If you're a sales person and you're not training alongside the operations people to make

87
00:05:15.84 --> 00:05:21.28
sure that you know how to communicate to them what you want and they know how to communicate

88
00:05:21.28 --> 00:05:24.72
to you what they can deliver.

89
00:05:24.72 --> 00:05:25.92
What about the IT group?

90
00:05:25.92 --> 00:05:29.24
Do they understand how to handle the threshold of emails that you're going to be getting?

91
00:05:29.24 --> 00:05:36.20
When you offer this new practice, all these things that need you need to work together.

92
00:05:36.20 --> 00:05:41.16
Sometimes it's because of internal competition as well.

93
00:05:41.16 --> 00:05:43.20
Wait that's why we wouldn't train together.

94
00:05:43.20 --> 00:05:51.48
Maybe or maybe but I think it's just like the straight up silos.

95
00:05:51.48 --> 00:05:52.48
You know what I'm saying?

96
00:05:52.48 --> 00:05:55.04
The straight up like hey this is my platoon I'm going to take care of my platoon.

97
00:05:55.04 --> 00:05:56.64
This is my division I'm going to take care of my platoon.

98
00:05:56.64 --> 00:05:58.48
This is my department I'm going to take care of my department.

99
00:05:58.48 --> 00:06:03.40
So like you're not thinking about necessarily the other guys or you're just like

100
00:06:03.40 --> 00:06:06.68
me and leave me alone.

101
00:06:06.68 --> 00:06:12.32
I think it could be either a real negative attitude but it could also be just a positive

102
00:06:12.32 --> 00:06:14.44
attitude that's like hey I'm going to train my platoon.

103
00:06:14.44 --> 00:06:15.44
That's what you're focused on.

104
00:06:15.44 --> 00:06:16.96
Yeah I'm going to train my platoon.

105
00:06:16.96 --> 00:06:18.44
Come here I'm going to train my platoon.

106
00:06:18.44 --> 00:06:20.16
We are going to be ready.

107
00:06:20.16 --> 00:06:23.80
Here's the problem you can be ready but if you can't call for fire correctly it doesn't

108
00:06:23.80 --> 00:06:27.48
matter if you've never coordinated with a QRF before it doesn't matter when that

109
00:06:27.48 --> 00:06:31.48
QRF is needed you don't know what you're doing.

110
00:06:31.48 --> 00:06:33.36
It happens in business too.

111
00:06:33.36 --> 00:06:37.16
Hey you know we're like I said we're the sales team.

112
00:06:37.16 --> 00:06:44.56
We don't care I'm not going to I don't need to train the the customer satisfaction group

113
00:06:44.56 --> 00:06:47.80
I don't need to train with them that's not my deal right.

114
00:06:47.80 --> 00:06:51.40
I don't care what happens when you know once I sell the product I don't care what happens

115
00:06:51.40 --> 00:06:57.48
oh really you should care what happens because if the client calls customer satisfaction

116
00:06:57.48 --> 00:07:00.20
it looks for a solution to a problem that they've got is they're implementing the thing

117
00:07:00.20 --> 00:07:04.32
that you just sold them and the solution isn't there guess what you're not getting good

118
00:07:04.32 --> 00:07:08.32
reviews and you're not going to sell anymore product to that company.

119
00:07:08.32 --> 00:07:12.32
Is the name customer satisfaction department is that it?

120
00:07:12.32 --> 00:07:13.32
Yeah yeah.

121
00:07:13.32 --> 00:07:17.20
Yeah we're sometimes they call it client implementation there's many many organizations

122
00:07:17.20 --> 00:07:20.96
that are set up in such a way that there's someone that sells the product and then there's

123
00:07:20.96 --> 00:07:24.68
someone that helps them implement the product and that's customer satisfaction.

124
00:07:24.68 --> 00:07:28.08
Could be customer satisfaction client satisfaction for some other names for a day if

125
00:07:28.08 --> 00:07:32.04
you can you think of any customer service tech support yeah stuff like that tech support

126
00:07:32.04 --> 00:07:37.000
that's a good one tech support you might think of like that's a broad based like hey I've

127
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.20
had this computer for two years and now it's not working.

128
00:07:41.20 --> 00:07:47.28
What's all I'm talking about companies where you buy a new system of software for your

129
00:07:47.28 --> 00:07:50.64
organization like a solar panel.

130
00:07:50.64 --> 00:07:55.40
I guess home by a solar panel for your roof.

131
00:07:55.40 --> 00:08:00.64
Well let's say let's say you did that maybe you buy solar panels for your roof right

132
00:08:00.64 --> 00:08:04.20
and then great you're the salesman you sell them to me guess what you're done when you're

133
00:08:04.20 --> 00:08:07.80
done selling me my solar panels you're on trying to sell the next pair.

134
00:08:07.80 --> 00:08:13.92
So when I call because the installation I'm having a hard time with I call customer satisfaction

135
00:08:13.92 --> 00:08:19.08
it's Dave Dave picks up the phone hey I just ordered this thing and now he says well

136
00:08:19.08 --> 00:08:22.40
how many you know and I say look we're having trouble installing this it doesn't fit

137
00:08:22.40 --> 00:08:29.28
on my roof right and you say okay well how many panels did you get and what size are

138
00:08:29.28 --> 00:08:35.80
they and all of a sudden he realizes that he needs to give you feedback that listen if the

139
00:08:35.80 --> 00:08:41.12
roof is this angle fits a different way and so now you can sell the product better and

140
00:08:41.12 --> 00:08:45.48
that will keep people more satisfied you can also do a follow-up called me and say hey

141
00:08:45.48 --> 00:08:50.12
hey sir I'm really sorry when I measured your roof I thought it was this angle and so

142
00:08:50.12 --> 00:08:53.32
I I I told you this thing here's what we're gonna do we're actually to come out and pick

143
00:08:53.32 --> 00:08:57.68
up three of the panels that you're not gonna need anymore and I'm gonna you know I'm gonna

144
00:08:57.68 --> 00:09:02.20
give you a 10% rebate and we're also sending an installer out there to give you a hand

145
00:09:02.20 --> 00:09:06.12
and boom right now I'm taking care of we're all happy now we guess what I'm doing when somebody

146
00:09:06.12 --> 00:09:11.40
asked me oh you got solar panels what company and I say oh echoes solar panels is it a

147
00:09:11.40 --> 00:09:14.64
good company yeah you know it was a little rough but they got everything taken care of

148
00:09:14.64 --> 00:09:18.20
you should definitely call them you see what I'm going with us yeah fully in the

149
00:09:18.20 --> 00:09:23.08
world you just took me down the rabbit hole solar installation that was good

150
00:09:23.08 --> 00:09:27.76
maybe not the best example but you did good I'm over here to run with it yeah yeah

151
00:09:27.76 --> 00:09:30.48
yeah that's good we're here to make it happen what do you got but yeah because I

152
00:09:30.48 --> 00:09:35.60
you don't really think about that when you're at work you know where you kind of

153
00:09:35.60 --> 00:09:40.80
want to be the best worker in company sure you know but the customer like experience

154
00:09:40.80 --> 00:09:44.20
is kind of the whole deal you know you know how like man when you leave your review

155
00:09:44.20 --> 00:09:48.28
you're like great product bad customer service and that can be like well that sucks

156
00:09:48.28 --> 00:09:51.80
because I need some customer service kind of thing so it's kind of a downer you know

157
00:09:51.80 --> 00:09:54.84
yeah because we're not thinking everything's going to work perfect every single time right

158
00:09:54.84 --> 00:09:58.68
I'm not necessarily you seem to say but I'm saying like you know you have these elements

159
00:09:58.68 --> 00:10:05.72
of a product or service that are all to the customer it's like it's all the same thing

160
00:10:05.72 --> 00:10:09.88
I'm not going to go to this person just for one thing I'm going to go I mean as far as

161
00:10:09.88 --> 00:10:14.84
one quality of their product they're going to they'll get turned off by other

162
00:10:14.84 --> 00:10:19.72
departments so if you work there for your just focus on yours rather that affects you

163
00:10:19.72 --> 00:10:24.60
that's what general car is saying you have to interact with other people inside

164
00:10:24.60 --> 00:10:31.000
your organization and if you're not doing that you're wrong you're wrong fast forward a

165
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.92
little training philosophy the basic the basic philosophy of successful training is

166
00:10:34.92 --> 00:10:40.36
that of obtaining superior results with average personnel god I love that

167
00:10:41.24 --> 00:10:46.60
with a reason or training is to take average people and make them exceptional superior results

168
00:10:46.60 --> 00:10:52.68
a unit to be truly outstanding should be excellent in all undertakings and activities

169
00:10:52.68 --> 00:10:56.76
commanders must know and understand that capabilities and limitations of personnel

170
00:10:56.76 --> 00:11:02.52
and set high and exacting standards of capabilities of the high ability of a group of

171
00:11:02.52 --> 00:11:08.12
units personnel this tends to give the low ability group a hopeless feeling because of

172
00:11:08.12 --> 00:11:14.36
having to compete against a standard which they cannot attain a unit satisfactory and all things

173
00:11:14.36 --> 00:11:21.96
is better than one outstanding in some excellent in others and unsatisfactory in a few

174
00:11:23.24 --> 00:11:31.08
that's a good thing to think about you know it's better to be good at a bunch I

175
00:11:31.08 --> 00:11:36.36
good at everything then outstanding at this one thing okay it's some other things in unsack

176
00:11:36.36 --> 00:11:38.36
in some final things

177
00:11:41.24 --> 00:11:46.52
next section fast forward a little bit emphasize fundamentals the basic difference between

178
00:11:46.52 --> 00:11:50.92
well trained unit and one that is not well trained is found in the attention paid to the

179
00:11:50.92 --> 00:11:55.56
fundamentals of marksmanship chemical biological and radiological warfare communications

180
00:11:55.56 --> 00:11:59.16
maintenance administration in all other arts and skills that contribute to making the unit

181
00:11:59.16 --> 00:12:04.52
combat ready in the shortest possible time a well trained soldier is the only foundation upon

182
00:12:04.52 --> 00:12:08.36
which effective combat ready units can be built when the soldier fails to demonstrate

183
00:12:08.36 --> 00:12:14.52
proficiency in individual skills the army's investment is wasted and the combat readiness of the

184
00:12:14.52 --> 00:12:21.64
unit is diminished each commander should approach his problems of combat readiness with a sense of

185
00:12:21.64 --> 00:12:31.24
wartime urgency there is no magic formula no sweatless solution to achieving a high state

186
00:12:31.24 --> 00:12:36.76
of combat readiness in a unit application the fundamentals enumerated below however will help

187
00:12:36.76 --> 00:12:42.76
so that by the way sweatless solution you've heard that before right that's that's that's hack

188
00:12:42.76 --> 00:12:49.16
well hack took that actual phrase and I was I had tried to find it in about face and of course

189
00:12:49.16 --> 00:12:53.88
that about faces 836 pages and I was like oh I know it's in here somewhere after I've

190
00:12:53.88 --> 00:12:58.28
I've done it on the podcast I've talked about the sweatless solution there is no sweatless solution

191
00:12:58.28 --> 00:13:02.76
we've covered that on the podcast you may have wondered where he got I was thought he made it up right

192
00:13:02.76 --> 00:13:07.56
of course we thought he made it up if you ever heard me say it maybe thought I made it up I didn't

193
00:13:07.56 --> 00:13:13.000
make it up neither do the hack there you go I believe the source is general clerk

194
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:20.20
sweatless solution that's like that's that stuck with me for a long time still is with me really

195
00:13:20.20 --> 00:13:25.16
because sweat in part of it is yes because I had to admit to myself brother to me a lot of the time

196
00:13:25.16 --> 00:13:31.32
I'm looking for that sweatless this faith in the space I've been if you can go and get like

197
00:13:31.32 --> 00:13:38.12
you know the kind where okay the other day echo Charles going deep standby

198
00:13:38.12 --> 00:13:47.64
get some so I'm sitting on the couch right in big shocker there's a there's a so the remote control

199
00:13:47.64 --> 00:13:51.000
I have the kind where you know like the remote control for the cable and then for the volume

200
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
they're two different okay so I got the one for the cable but I was like the volume one is

201
00:13:59.40 --> 00:14:05.16
like the volume one is somewhere else you know the kind you're looking around has to be close to you

202
00:14:05.16 --> 00:14:08.52
right because it's not like it's you know in the next room or something like that's not it

203
00:14:08.52 --> 00:14:13.24
doesn't have it's not gonna go far it's but it's around here somewhere right this is what we train for

204
00:14:13.24 --> 00:14:21.64
bro talking about this is a loose there so you know you kind of look around your little vicinity

205
00:14:21.64 --> 00:14:26.68
or whatever I'm not getting up though bro I'm already sitting down that might cause me to sweat a

206
00:14:26.68 --> 00:14:31.24
little bit but whatever so I'm looking around and I turn around and we have this ledge like behind

207
00:14:31.24 --> 00:14:37.56
the couch they're you know that ledge there and I look and it's behind me but it's the kind

208
00:14:37.56 --> 00:14:42.76
of incident this weird spot where I can't like I gotta stand up just if I want to stood up

209
00:14:42.76 --> 00:14:46.60
when I first saw it but I would have had the remote control enjoying some television at this

210
00:14:46.60 --> 00:14:51.88
point but I'm like trying to contort my body like all weird it was weird it was almost like I was

211
00:14:51.88 --> 00:14:59.08
putting more effort into my sweatless solution then actual energy would have been expanded if I went

212
00:14:59.08 --> 00:15:05.64
for the sweat solution the real one you know put it in just stand up for a second you know but I'm saying

213
00:15:05.64 --> 00:15:17.32
okay so the point the point the point the point is the point is bro I'm talking about hack or

214
00:15:17.32 --> 00:15:21.56
I'm talking about general Clark he served in World War World War 2 Korea and the

215
00:15:21.56 --> 00:15:29.80
current was a non-most decorated soldier you couldn't get your remote I could one I'm saying is

216
00:15:30.92 --> 00:15:38.20
sometimes we ask the people sometimes we put so much effort into looking for a sweatless solution

217
00:15:38.20 --> 00:15:45.96
okay seems like as a philosophy you know and how general Clark is saying subsequently hack

218
00:15:45.96 --> 00:15:51.96
worse subsequently Choco whether they're saying stop looking for the sweatless solution stop like straight up

219
00:15:52.68 --> 00:15:57.48
but just do the work stand up get through the remote control

220
00:15:57.48 --> 00:16:06.68
whatever this may be the apex of the echo Charles examples of just saying there's a lot of those

221
00:16:06.68 --> 00:16:10.44
you look like when you're vacuuming and you see the little thing it doesn't want to get sucked up by

222
00:16:10.44 --> 00:16:15.80
the vacuum just been no picking up you should and I don't want to do that so you're like

223
00:16:15.80 --> 00:16:21.24
kick it to try to get it loose you whatever I'm just saying these lessons are kind of everywhere

224
00:16:21.24 --> 00:16:29.64
when you think of it you don't say alright man general Clark would agree I mean I know he definitely

225
00:16:29.64 --> 00:16:36.04
would when he wasn't like on the line yeah of course fighting the Nazis yeah or fighting the

226
00:16:36.04 --> 00:16:43.40
communists yeah these guys didn't even have remote controls bro yeah excuse more counterice

227
00:16:43.40 --> 00:16:48.68
for I will be just trying to understand alright well there you go alright so back to the book

228
00:16:51.24 --> 00:16:55.72
he's talking about the things that you can you can do to keep a unit trained up number one

229
00:16:55.72 --> 00:17:00.28
do essential things first there's not enough time for the commander to do everything

230
00:17:00.28 --> 00:17:04.04
each commander will have to determine wisely what is essential and a sign response abilities for

231
00:17:04.04 --> 00:17:09.08
accomplishment he should spend the remaining time on near essentials this is especially true of

232
00:17:09.08 --> 00:17:14.76
training not essential should not take up required time required for essentials what do we call that

233
00:17:15.48 --> 00:17:22.60
we call that prioritize next year next thing do things right the first time

234
00:17:23.64 --> 00:17:29.16
the commander should not consider his unit ready for battle until it can carry out a plan well the first

235
00:17:29.16 --> 00:17:34.52
time to often commanders hold rehearsals of things their unit should be able to do well without

236
00:17:34.52 --> 00:17:40.68
rehearsal I like this because this is like a little bit you know there's this mantra in the

237
00:17:40.68 --> 00:17:46.52
games about you should do one foot one third planning one third gear prep one third rehearsal we

238
00:17:46.52 --> 00:17:51.32
put all this emphasis in the rehearsal which is awesome and I 100% believe that but you should

239
00:17:51.32 --> 00:17:55.000
there's things that you shouldn't have to rehearse right and that's what he said or something

240
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.44
he just just know should have some some standard operating positions that you should know

241
00:17:59.56 --> 00:18:04.04
look are we gonna rehearse some yes we are but you should know you shouldn't need you should

242
00:18:04.04 --> 00:18:08.68
rehearse him you shouldn't have to rehearse but you should rehearse I rehearse everything

243
00:18:11.24 --> 00:18:17.40
this practice causes officers and men expecting a dry run or two to pay little attention to

244
00:18:17.40 --> 00:18:23.40
initial instructions and to make inadequate preparations there will be no dry runs in combat

245
00:18:25.96 --> 00:18:30.84
it is good to issue adequate instructions and hold officers and men to them the first time

246
00:18:30.84 --> 00:18:36.44
that's something that I wish I would have learned imagine saying hey look hey look I'm going to tell

247
00:18:36.44 --> 00:18:41.88
you guys this one time there we're going to go execute no rehearsals just to see just to just

248
00:18:41.88 --> 00:18:47.96
to get people in the mindset of paying attention and figuring out where your directions and your

249
00:18:47.96 --> 00:18:53.64
planning is a short fall because if I can't say okay Dave here's what we're going to do you're

250
00:18:53.64 --> 00:18:56.04
going to go in this building I'm going to go in this building you're going to take your squad

251
00:18:56.04 --> 00:18:58.84
you're going to move to here you're going to move to there does everyone understand all right we're

252
00:18:58.84 --> 00:19:06.44
going to go do it right now in this training exercise with no rehearsals that will show us the short

253
00:19:06.44 --> 00:19:13.000
falls of our planning and our communication it will also show the team short falls and when they

254
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.84
don't know what to do they should raise their hand and say hey boss that doesn't make sense to me

255
00:19:16.84 --> 00:19:20.92
right now hold on a second let me hear that again I don't understand that part

256
00:19:20.92 --> 00:19:31.000
practice more than one thing at a time okay so wait a second are we going against prioritize

257
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
next cue does that what's happening no actually whenever I see a unit practicing only one thing

258
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.92
at a time I'd remember of the history paper my son brought home one day the grammar construction

259
00:19:40.92 --> 00:19:46.28
and spelling were not good this is very poor English I told him but daddy said I was only being tested

260
00:19:46.28 --> 00:19:52.44
in history sound training requires that many subjects be skillfully integrated and taught

261
00:19:52.44 --> 00:20:00.12
concurrently this is an excellent time saver in training and he goes through this and any what he's

262
00:20:00.12 --> 00:20:04.52
saying is look you gotta do multiple things at the same time and even though prioritize an

263
00:20:04.52 --> 00:20:09.24
execute when you got multiple problems and you can't try and solve them all at the same time that

264
00:20:09.24 --> 00:20:17.96
doesn't mean that you're gonna say hold on a second we need to move towards the target but we also

265
00:20:17.96 --> 00:20:23.000
need to make communications we can only do one at a time no there's things that you have to do concurrently

266
00:20:24.44 --> 00:20:30.28
and that can include hey we've got to move wounded people and we've got to fight a firefight if we

267
00:20:30.28 --> 00:20:36.28
only ever practice just getting in a firefight and just moving people how do we know how to do

268
00:20:36.28 --> 00:20:41.000
both those things at the same time which you may have to do so do you have to prioritize next

269
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.40
you yes you do but guess what you also have to learn how to do things concurrently

270
00:20:49.72 --> 00:20:54.52
he says a paper integration and training schedule is not efficient so just like talking about

271
00:20:54.52 --> 00:20:58.76
it well you know if we have to do move a wounded guy while we're in a firefight well then

272
00:21:00.04 --> 00:21:06.12
we'll just do this xyz no you have to try it which is contradictory to rehearsals right

273
00:21:06.12 --> 00:21:14.12
no don't don't don't do rehearsals yes do rehearsals a commander should take every opportunity to

274
00:21:14.12 --> 00:21:18.60
exploit the effects of integrated training it is the key to accelerate intensified unit combat

275
00:21:18.60 --> 00:21:24.04
training in effect it increases the amount of available training time good eliminate the habit

276
00:21:24.04 --> 00:21:29.72
eliminate the administrative habit in training I'm convinced that all commanders should take maximum

277
00:21:29.72 --> 00:21:35.000
advantage of field training time to develop correct tactical practices and procedures we talked

278
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.80
about that one last time practice dispersion concealment and can of camouflage the penalty for bad

279
00:21:41.80 --> 00:21:47.40
habits and passive measures in air defense or warrants special mentioned the day when American

280
00:21:47.40 --> 00:21:55.24
soldier could be relaxed about dispersion concealment and camouflage is in the past so how does this

281
00:21:55.24 --> 00:22:03.56
apply to everyday life and business train how you fight train how you fight know the status of

282
00:22:03.56 --> 00:22:12.92
men and equipment check up on those that are absentee from training practice maintenance in the field

283
00:22:12.92 --> 00:22:17.56
practice and he's got little sections about these each one of these practice sound troop leading

284
00:22:17.56 --> 00:22:23.16
procedures the subject of troop leading procedures and allied techniques requires increased emphasis

285
00:22:23.16 --> 00:22:29.40
on tactical exercises fundamentals found in field manuals and related publications are worthy of stress

286
00:22:29.40 --> 00:22:35.88
sound command procedures diligently practiced in all field training will form good habits in the unit

287
00:22:35.88 --> 00:22:45.40
commander form the checklist habit meticulous planning and reconnaissance are required to make sure

288
00:22:45.40 --> 00:22:50.60
that every minute in the field will be expanded profitably check this for this purpose are

289
00:22:50.60 --> 00:22:56.52
necessary command and staff tool just as they are for supervising and testing the conduct of training

290
00:22:56.52 --> 00:23:02.92
what do you got I got the same thing I keep thinking about every time I hear what he has to say he he keeps

291
00:23:02.92 --> 00:23:10.36
repeating fundamental sound realistic fundamentals these are the fundamental to the basic things all

292
00:23:10.36 --> 00:23:17.56
the basic things associated with their job and being good at those things and training in a real

293
00:23:17.56 --> 00:23:27.40
asexinereo there's a lot obviously general carcass talking about war he's recounting his experiences

294
00:23:27.40 --> 00:23:34.20
war I hear what he's saying is connecting it to war but the the application of these things as I keep

295
00:23:34.20 --> 00:23:37.88
hearing it in my head hearing what you're saying and thinking about the things I'm thinking about now

296
00:23:38.76 --> 00:23:44.68
if you are in the private sector anywhere the private sector unless you happen to be

297
00:23:44.68 --> 00:23:51.16
in one of the rare sectors that's not competitive and there are almost none if you are in the

298
00:23:51.16 --> 00:23:58.28
if you are in the American capitalist private sector you are at war your competitors

299
00:23:59.24 --> 00:24:04.44
don't want to share space with you they don't want to cooperate with you to to work in harmony

300
00:24:04.44 --> 00:24:09.88
to they want to run you over they want to take all of your clients all of your market share

301
00:24:09.88 --> 00:24:14.60
and all of your product they want to take all that from you and the way you are successful is the

302
00:24:14.60 --> 00:24:19.40
exact same things your people have to be trained on the fundamentals and everything that applies to

303
00:24:19.40 --> 00:24:24.36
them and the only way to do that is to find a way to train them realistically that replicates what

304
00:24:24.36 --> 00:24:30.12
they're going to deal with in the real war in their real world it's just kind of crazy how

305
00:24:31.56 --> 00:24:37.16
while it seems difficult to make the connection to his world the connection is so straightforward

306
00:24:37.16 --> 00:24:43.96
to any world that you're operating in you know I've broached this subject before and I'm sure

307
00:24:43.96 --> 00:24:53.64
there's got to be some kind of scientific or psychological experiment or whatever but the

308
00:24:55.32 --> 00:25:05.000
the improvement of your response from a time when you don't know what's going to happen and you

309
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.64
haven't practiced it to a time when you do know what's going to happen you have practiced it

310
00:25:09.64 --> 00:25:14.76
is exponential is absolutely exponential and we see this all the time and that's not

311
00:25:14.76 --> 00:25:18.36
front when we roll play with people totally we put up someone in a role playing scenario

312
00:25:18.36 --> 00:25:22.84
and and they say we know I've got to go talk to this I'm going to talk to my subordinate leader who's

313
00:25:22.84 --> 00:25:29.32
got a giant ego and okay roll in there and just talk to him see how that goes it's going to be a

314
00:25:29.32 --> 00:25:34.52
disaster so you roll play and guess what the first time you roll play it's a disaster the second time

315
00:25:34.52 --> 00:25:39.88
it's 10 times better yeah and then the third time it's 15 times better and then the fourth time

316
00:25:39.88 --> 00:25:46.84
it's 17 times better but that first look that first look that you get when you know a little bit of

317
00:25:46.84 --> 00:25:54.68
what to expect man you are just you're you're exponentially more prepared for that situation

318
00:25:54.68 --> 00:25:59.72
and and we know when you're in a leadership position you're going to roll into a meeting where you've

319
00:25:59.72 --> 00:26:04.12
got to deliver some bad news to the troops you know what they're going to say you know there's

320
00:26:04.12 --> 00:26:10.04
eight responses you're going to get why not think through those things why not think through those things

321
00:26:10.04 --> 00:26:13.64
you're going to talk to a client that you've disappointed you've let down you've made a mistake

322
00:26:13.64 --> 00:26:20.12
you know they're going to have one of six different reactions why not work through those why not

323
00:26:20.12 --> 00:26:25.16
have a contingency plan for each one of those six things this will take you four minutes to do

324
00:26:25.16 --> 00:26:30.52
it'll take you and I four minutes to roll play may it'll take us five ten minutes to roll play

325
00:26:30.52 --> 00:26:35.88
the six different responses when I roll into you and I say hey Dave listen I know we promised you

326
00:26:35.88 --> 00:26:41.56
this product on this date we ran into some hiccups here's the mistakes that I made here's what

327
00:26:41.56 --> 00:26:45.40
we're going to try and do to resolve it you're only going to be able to say so many different

328
00:26:45.40 --> 00:26:50.52
things back to me and and depending on how I respond I could either salvage that relationship or

329
00:26:50.52 --> 00:26:56.36
I could destroy it so why would we not train to be prepared for this there's no reason there's no

330
00:26:56.36 --> 00:27:02.28
excuse for it it doesn't take a week to train for that situation takes ten minutes it does it takes

331
00:27:02.28 --> 00:27:09.56
ten minutes if your own brain is the only place where you consider the potential outcomes of that

332
00:27:09.56 --> 00:27:15.32
conversation you're going to miss so many things if I get one other person sit across for me

333
00:27:15.96 --> 00:27:23.32
to answer in any way that they want how I'm going to interact with them I actually now a reveal

334
00:27:23.32 --> 00:27:27.24
the well I didn't expect that I didn't see that coming I don't know what to say here

335
00:27:27.88 --> 00:27:32.84
and you also have to have the other person to just interact with you in a way that helps you anticipate

336
00:27:33.64 --> 00:27:39.96
a real response that you won't consider if you do it in your own brain which is a vacuum

337
00:27:39.96 --> 00:27:43.16
because what you can convince yourself is oh this isn't going to be that hard of a conversation I'm

338
00:27:43.16 --> 00:27:47.48
just going to say this he's going to say that and everything's going to be fine the role play

339
00:27:47.48 --> 00:27:54.20
winners we do to just to add one more thing to that when we do role play it usually comes right

340
00:27:54.20 --> 00:28:00.84
after we've done the initial training where we explain it he's and he talked about this that is

341
00:28:00.84 --> 00:28:05.72
that is paper training hey this is what we're going to do and it makes sense we think we understand

342
00:28:05.72 --> 00:28:10.60
it in our heads it resonates and we can explain these principles and we say okay let's roll

343
00:28:10.60 --> 00:28:17.32
model this the first role role play the first role play is always a disaster even when we just talked

344
00:28:17.32 --> 00:28:26.04
about it because on paper isn't enough it's not enough and three role plays later five minutes

345
00:28:26.04 --> 00:28:31.48
later they've gone from here to way up here and then they can actually go have that conversation

346
00:28:31.48 --> 00:28:36.68
in real life in real time with the real person that need to talk to you that five minutes of live

347
00:28:36.68 --> 00:28:45.000
realistic fundamental training is the difference this brings up another topic so I said hey look this

348
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.80
this individual is only got to have six different responses right there's a seventh and the seventh

349
00:28:51.80 --> 00:28:57.24
is one that you didn't predict you didn't understand and you didn't think could come and guess what you can

350
00:28:57.24 --> 00:29:01.64
actually train your response for the thing that you just came that came completely out of left

351
00:29:01.64 --> 00:29:08.68
field and it might be as simple as when Dave if Dave says something to me that I had no anticipation

352
00:29:08.68 --> 00:29:12.44
and it doesn't make any sense to me what am I going to do you know what I'm going to do?

353
00:29:12.44 --> 00:29:17.80
I'm going to say if Dave says to me well I'll tell you what not only do we want our money back

354
00:29:17.80 --> 00:29:22.84
I want to I want to take you guys to court I didn't expect him to say that our relationship was not

355
00:29:22.84 --> 00:29:30.12
bad and I you know my response to him if I don't know what else to say I'm going to say

356
00:29:30.12 --> 00:29:35.80
Dave you know what I need to think about this for a minute let me just think about what you're saying

357
00:29:35.80 --> 00:29:40.52
because I want to make sure I understand that right there that right there is a response and it

358
00:29:40.52 --> 00:29:45.16
and if I'm prepared for it you know here's a funny one when it used to be back in the day and the

359
00:29:45.16 --> 00:29:52.20
deems when you would go to get your seal tried it you had it you should you got done with

360
00:29:52.20 --> 00:29:56.20
buds you went to a team you went through more training and then you were on probation for six

361
00:29:56.20 --> 00:30:02.36
months and then you had to go do an oral board for all the different departments and you had to go

362
00:30:02.36 --> 00:30:08.12
and program the radios and break down the weapons and build demolition charges and you know show

363
00:30:08.12 --> 00:30:11.24
how to put on a parachute rig and set up a diary you had to do all these different things

364
00:30:11.24 --> 00:30:17.72
and answer all these questions and one of the things that you learned was or you better have learned

365
00:30:17.72 --> 00:30:23.16
was when someone asked you a question that you don't know you better have a response for and the

366
00:30:23.16 --> 00:30:28.20
response is you know master chief I'm not exactly sure of the answer to that question but I know

367
00:30:28.20 --> 00:30:33.000
that it is in the dive manual that I can find down in the dive locker that's great that's

368
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.04
that's a that's a response that the master chief says all right fair enough we'll go you better get

369
00:30:38.04 --> 00:30:47.56
you better start learning a little bit deeper but if you go oh oh oh is it 30 feet for 30 minutes

370
00:30:47.56 --> 00:30:53.96
no it's not 30 feet for 30 minutes you try and BS the master chief and you're going to end up

371
00:30:53.96 --> 00:31:00.92
getting your ass kicked so what you do is you and we did this we roleplayed the the oral board

372
00:31:01.80 --> 00:31:04.92
me and my friends that had showed up at sealed team one and we'd gone through this training

373
00:31:04.92 --> 00:31:09.000
and now we were getting ready for that all but we we crushed each other in those oral boards

374
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.40
and one of the things that we figured out was which we got you know some of the senior guys said

375
00:31:13.40 --> 00:31:18.92
hey listen if you don't know the answer it's okay here's the response but rehearsing that and

376
00:31:18.92 --> 00:31:26.36
being ready for it is infinitely better than no rehearsal going there blind and get get smacked

377
00:31:26.36 --> 00:31:31.96
upside the head with something you didn't expect that you will talk yourself into that you've

378
00:31:31.96 --> 00:31:35.96
got to cover if you're doing this alone you'll tell yourself this isn't gonna be that hard I

379
00:31:35.96 --> 00:31:40.12
got this covered and you go in there solo you're gonna get crushed because you just you don't

380
00:31:40.12 --> 00:31:47.40
have that other person that to put you in a spot and go wow hang on a second training is important yes

381
00:31:49.24 --> 00:31:53.64
he breaks down here organization for unit training training plans

382
00:31:54.92 --> 00:31:59.72
comprehensible and workable plans are indispensable and should be formulated with consideration of the

383
00:31:59.72 --> 00:32:07.000
falling for essentials established training goals that's number one number two continuous evaluation

384
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.88
this process must go on throughout the training cycle and as an integral part of it

385
00:32:14.68 --> 00:32:19.40
only by continuous evaluation can deficiencies be discovered early enough to make immediate

386
00:32:19.40 --> 00:32:26.12
correction possible number three testing closely related to evaluation is the more formal testing

387
00:32:26.12 --> 00:32:30.52
that is given to an individual or unit at the conclusion of a phase of training or block of

388
00:32:30.52 --> 00:32:35.40
instruction it's here that we determine whether our training goals have been met number four

389
00:32:35.40 --> 00:32:42.36
remedial training I must emphasize here the value of remedial or makeup training once event once a

390
00:32:42.36 --> 00:32:47.56
valuation in testing have identified the areas of deficiency remedial training must be used to correct them

391
00:32:48.20 --> 00:32:53.72
it should be an integral part of every training schedule of course the instruction will be designed to

392
00:32:53.72 --> 00:32:57.96
overcome specific weaknesses that have been exposed by the testing program and will have

393
00:32:58.52 --> 00:33:03.64
to be keyed to the specific needs of your unit it is essential however that remedial training

394
00:33:03.64 --> 00:33:10.68
be regularly scheduled gosh that makes sense so those are the four things established training goals

395
00:33:10.68 --> 00:33:18.52
continuous evaluation testing and remedial training what would that was their tests whether tests

396
00:33:18.52 --> 00:33:25.000
at each phase of top gun as you are going through the training yeah absolutely what was an example of

397
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.20
a test the most common test that we give is that we'd want to make sure the students understood

398
00:33:30.20 --> 00:33:35.72
the mechanics of a system so how a missile system worked how the targeting system worked how the

399
00:33:35.72 --> 00:33:39.32
radar system worked you out we wanted to make sure they understood the mechanics of it

400
00:33:39.96 --> 00:33:45.56
before they use it in practical terms it probably isn't too much different than your experience

401
00:33:45.56 --> 00:33:49.64
of understanding how the radios worked before you were using them in the field right you have

402
00:33:49.64 --> 00:33:55.40
to understand hf propagation yeah you did you have to understand the i honest fear you you

403
00:33:55.40 --> 00:33:59.96
absolutely did because what happened is you're going to find yourself in a position and this is

404
00:33:59.96 --> 00:34:04.92
me I don't know I wasn't that position is if you're in a particular geography particular place

405
00:34:04.92 --> 00:34:09.40
and talking to a particular other person some radios going to work better than other radios

406
00:34:09.40 --> 00:34:13.72
this is true you might need to know hey you know what we're like in the bushes here in the

407
00:34:13.72 --> 00:34:17.48
in the wilderness so in the jungle this radio doesn't work here doesn't penetrate through this

408
00:34:17.48 --> 00:34:22.52
this thing so there's a million different examples of that if you get that out of order and you

409
00:34:22.52 --> 00:34:27.24
just work you you learn how to maneuver the system like my my my cursor moves at the here I

410
00:34:27.24 --> 00:34:31.80
move my my cursor on the display here and you don't actually know what's happening to the mechanics

411
00:34:31.80 --> 00:34:38.20
behind that you're going to start making mistakes inside in specific settings oh it work here

412
00:34:38.20 --> 00:34:42.36
so much work everywhere like no it doesn't work everywhere this environment is optimized here

413
00:34:42.36 --> 00:34:45.88
this environment it doesn't work at all and if all you know is the mechanics and not what's

414
00:34:45.88 --> 00:34:50.12
happening behind it you actually can't apply it when it matters the most you know what that made me

415
00:34:50.12 --> 00:34:57.64
think of the book Leadership Strategy and Tactics by me because it's I say an exact same thing

416
00:34:57.64 --> 00:35:03.16
but when I'm talking I compare I compare a leader to a woodworker and talk about the fact

417
00:35:03.16 --> 00:35:08.28
that you know when you're a leader you got to know the different tools but then you got a

418
00:35:08.28 --> 00:35:11.48
if you're a woodworker you've got to know the different tools and then you've got to know the

419
00:35:11.48 --> 00:35:14.60
different types of wood and then you've got to know how to apply those different types

420
00:35:14.60 --> 00:35:17.40
those different tools to different types of wood and then you've got to realize that even

421
00:35:17.40 --> 00:35:21.20
each individual piece of wood, a piece of pine is super soft,

422
00:35:21.20 --> 00:35:22.64
a piece of oak is super hard.

423
00:35:22.64 --> 00:35:24.60
You gotta use those tools differently

424
00:35:24.60 --> 00:35:26.56
with those different types of wood,

425
00:35:26.56 --> 00:35:28.52
and then on top of that,

426
00:35:28.52 --> 00:35:31.72
each individual piece of pine is different.

427
00:35:31.72 --> 00:35:34.28
It has a not, it has a rift, it has a cut,

428
00:35:34.28 --> 00:35:37.24
it has a split, and you gotta know how to deal with that.

429
00:35:37.24 --> 00:35:39.60
So you gotta understand the principles of the tools.

430
00:35:42.12 --> 00:35:45.12
I may regularly plagiarize the hell at that book,

431
00:35:45.12 --> 00:35:46.84
but I don't know where to go.

432
00:35:46.84 --> 00:35:48.000
Check.

433
00:35:49.16 --> 00:35:51.20
Talks about assignment of administrative tasks.

434
00:35:51.20 --> 00:35:54.48
He talks about when a unit is under strength.

435
00:35:54.48 --> 00:35:57.000
Reduce strengths must be offset

436
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.04
by more efficient utilization of men and women.

437
00:35:59.04 --> 00:36:00.72
Now, you know, I gotta ask this question today,

438
00:36:00.72 --> 00:36:01.92
we've buy a client.

439
00:36:01.92 --> 00:36:03.32
Yeah, but we don't, we don't, we don't,

440
00:36:03.32 --> 00:36:04.60
we need more people.

441
00:36:04.60 --> 00:36:07.64
Guess what, everybody, everybody needs more people.

442
00:36:08.76 --> 00:36:12.52
We got visited by a senior ranking officer

443
00:36:12.52 --> 00:36:14.64
in the Seal Teams, what are we in the Rmadi?

444
00:36:14.64 --> 00:36:16.68
And at Lafelite's tell the story,

445
00:36:16.68 --> 00:36:20.96
the, you know, great, great officer, huge supporter,

446
00:36:20.96 --> 00:36:23.28
says, hey, what else do you need out here?

447
00:36:23.28 --> 00:36:24.72
Is there anything else you need?

448
00:36:24.72 --> 00:36:27.08
And I said, I need two more tasks units worth of men.

449
00:36:27.08 --> 00:36:32.08
You know, like we had enough missions to get everybody busy.

450
00:36:32.08 --> 00:36:33.72
But guess what, we didn't get anybody.

451
00:36:33.72 --> 00:36:35.88
We didn't, you know, like that's the way it works.

452
00:36:37.68 --> 00:36:40.56
Next little section in Jack Realism.

453
00:36:40.56 --> 00:36:44.32
The experienced commander knows that soldiers do

454
00:36:44.32 --> 00:36:46.36
and combat exactly what they have been taught

455
00:36:46.36 --> 00:36:47.72
and have practiced in training.

456
00:36:47.72 --> 00:36:50.36
Therefore, each training situation and problem

457
00:36:50.36 --> 00:36:52.88
must be as valid and realistic as possible

458
00:36:52.88 --> 00:36:56.80
with unreal or artificial aspects eliminated.

459
00:36:56.80 --> 00:36:59.52
Training must reflect as many of the conditions,

460
00:36:59.52 --> 00:37:02.32
scenes, noises and situations of the battlefield

461
00:37:02.32 --> 00:37:07.32
as ingenuity can conceive and safety rules will permit.

462
00:37:07.32 --> 00:37:12.32
And I remember, I remember I put on, we'd be doing,

463
00:37:13.88 --> 00:37:15.56
when I got back from my last plan,

464
00:37:15.56 --> 00:37:18.68
when we got back from Madi and I took over training,

465
00:37:18.68 --> 00:37:21.64
a few months into that, when you would put on your nods

466
00:37:21.64 --> 00:37:24.32
at night, you would, you might as well be in Iraq.

467
00:37:24.32 --> 00:37:26.12
You might as well have been in Iraq.

468
00:37:26.12 --> 00:37:30.08
We had, we had the, the speakers playing gun battles

469
00:37:30.08 --> 00:37:31.84
and called a prayer.

470
00:37:31.84 --> 00:37:33.84
We had tires burning.

471
00:37:33.84 --> 00:37:36.80
We had people dressed up like, you know, local Iraq.

472
00:37:36.80 --> 00:37:38.48
He said, it's in walking around.

473
00:37:38.48 --> 00:37:40.32
It was freaking awesome.

474
00:37:40.32 --> 00:37:42.28
It was freaking awesome.

475
00:37:42.28 --> 00:37:43.76
That's what you're supposed to do.

476
00:37:46.36 --> 00:37:47.20
Damn, I remember that.

477
00:37:47.20 --> 00:37:49.88
The first time we were rolling into the Moulab

478
00:37:49.88 --> 00:37:51.48
and it was early in the morning.

479
00:37:51.48 --> 00:37:54.56
It was, it was actually when the blue on blue happened

480
00:37:54.56 --> 00:37:57.12
in extreme ownership, but we were rolling in there.

481
00:37:58.16 --> 00:38:01.84
I remember rolling in like there's tires burning in the streets

482
00:38:01.84 --> 00:38:04.88
and yeah, I was like, okay,

483
00:38:04.88 --> 00:38:06.92
because what does that do that screws up your nods?

484
00:38:06.92 --> 00:38:08.24
And luckily the sun was coming up,

485
00:38:08.24 --> 00:38:09.76
but it was still dark outside,

486
00:38:09.76 --> 00:38:12.000
but I'm thinking these, these Mujahideen fighters,

487
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.72
know what they're doing.

488
00:38:13.72 --> 00:38:15.12
These guys know what they're doing.

489
00:38:15.12 --> 00:38:16.32
They're, and then guess what?

490
00:38:16.32 --> 00:38:18.000
So it messes up your night vision,

491
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.56
we understand that these burning fires

492
00:38:19.56 --> 00:38:21.08
and then the sun comes up.

493
00:38:21.08 --> 00:38:23.52
Well now there's just black, smoke everywhere.

494
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.92
And you can gear and damn,

495
00:38:29.92 --> 00:38:33.16
to you that when I got back and I was running training,

496
00:38:33.16 --> 00:38:34.48
you rolled out of the street.

497
00:38:34.48 --> 00:38:35.76
We're burning tires.

498
00:38:35.76 --> 00:38:37.44
Your night vision is gonna be all jacked up

499
00:38:37.44 --> 00:38:39.24
and when you're done with the night vision being all jacked up

500
00:38:39.24 --> 00:38:41.44
and the sun comes up, guess what?

501
00:38:41.44 --> 00:38:43.24
It's gonna be black smoke everywhere.

502
00:38:44.76 --> 00:38:47.36
One of the best ways to emphasize realism

503
00:38:47.36 --> 00:38:50.20
is to assess personnel casualties

504
00:38:50.20 --> 00:38:53.76
for improper use of cover, or in the case of night exercise

505
00:38:53.76 --> 00:38:55.24
as vehicles can be knocked out for on off,

506
00:38:55.24 --> 00:38:56.08
rise to use of nights.

507
00:38:56.08 --> 00:38:58.000
What does that mean you're putting people down?

508
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
This is like trade-et instructions.

509
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
I might as well have written this for trade-et to use.

510
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.24
This is exactly what we did.

511
00:39:06.24 --> 00:39:08.48
Oh, you're not saying to my cover, cool, you're dead.

512
00:39:09.48 --> 00:39:11.24
Oh, you're gonna move out, cross an open street

513
00:39:11.24 --> 00:39:12.76
without any cover fire, Roger that, you're dead,

514
00:39:12.76 --> 00:39:13.84
you're down, man.

515
00:39:13.84 --> 00:39:15.20
Now let's get this thing figured out.

516
00:39:15.20 --> 00:39:17.28
Oh, by the way, your buddy wants to come help you immediately

517
00:39:17.28 --> 00:39:19.96
without putting down suppressor fire, cool, he's dead too.

518
00:39:19.96 --> 00:39:21.88
Let's rock and roll, who wants to figure this out?

519
00:39:21.88 --> 00:39:24.84
Who wants to put the cover in cover, move?

520
00:39:24.84 --> 00:39:26.08
Dude, you're literally like,

521
00:39:26.08 --> 00:39:28.52
I wrote that thing down fundamental sound and realistic.

522
00:39:28.52 --> 00:39:29.80
Oh, cool, you're not applying the fundamentals?

523
00:39:29.80 --> 00:39:30.88
Good, you're dead.

524
00:39:30.88 --> 00:39:32.12
Oh, your tactics aren't sound?

525
00:39:32.12 --> 00:39:32.96
Cool, he's gone.

526
00:39:32.96 --> 00:39:33.80
Now what are you gonna do?

527
00:39:33.80 --> 00:39:35.36
I mean, I should have a track,

528
00:39:35.36 --> 00:39:38.04
or I should literally just be marking how many times he and you

529
00:39:38.04 --> 00:39:41.08
were referring back to the realism that's required.

530
00:39:41.08 --> 00:39:44.80
And the beauty of that, especially when you have experiences,

531
00:39:44.80 --> 00:39:47.08
it completely takes away the ammunition of,

532
00:39:47.08 --> 00:39:48.64
this would never happen.

533
00:39:48.64 --> 00:39:50.16
Or this is unrealistic, you know,

534
00:39:50.16 --> 00:39:53.000
them the, the, the, the, the unwindable scenarios,

535
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.20
we go, well, this would never happen.

536
00:39:54.20 --> 00:39:55.04
Oh, really?

537
00:39:55.04 --> 00:39:56.52
Oh, cool, this would never happen.

538
00:39:56.52 --> 00:39:57.36
Watch this.

539
00:39:57.36 --> 00:39:58.20
Yeah.

540
00:39:58.20 --> 00:40:00.84
And the easier the training is,

541
00:40:00.84 --> 00:40:04.32
the more acclimated people get to things being easy.

542
00:40:04.32 --> 00:40:06.76
And the more unwilling they are to believe how difficult

543
00:40:06.76 --> 00:40:08.04
they can be.

544
00:40:08.04 --> 00:40:09.24
And when you're training is realistic,

545
00:40:09.24 --> 00:40:10.88
how many times have you told me

546
00:40:10.88 --> 00:40:13.60
and everybody the story of Seth's first firefighter,

547
00:40:13.60 --> 00:40:18.08
and the guys like, wow, how many firefighters have you been in?

548
00:40:18.08 --> 00:40:20.32
You must be, and he's like,

549
00:40:20.32 --> 00:40:21.16
it was my first one.

550
00:40:21.16 --> 00:40:22.16
That was my first one.

551
00:40:22.16 --> 00:40:24.84
That comes from fundamental sound, realistic training.

552
00:40:24.84 --> 00:40:26.16
Yeah. And putting that guy in position,

553
00:40:26.16 --> 00:40:27.84
I might not be in a, I don't know what this is.

554
00:40:27.84 --> 00:40:28.88
I can't recreate this scenario.

555
00:40:28.88 --> 00:40:30.44
I don't know exactly how it's gonna play out,

556
00:40:30.44 --> 00:40:32.24
but I do know what it's gonna be.

557
00:40:32.24 --> 00:40:34.72
I do understand how this is gonna reveal itself.

558
00:40:34.72 --> 00:40:36.32
And the only way to prepare for that is

559
00:40:36.32 --> 00:40:37.88
fundamental sound, realistic training,

560
00:40:37.88 --> 00:40:39.24
over and over and over again.

561
00:40:43.12 --> 00:40:44.44
Emphasis on night training.

562
00:40:45.80 --> 00:40:47.52
Self-sufficiency and confidence,

563
00:40:47.52 --> 00:40:50.12
our key factors in developing a unit's capability

564
00:40:50.12 --> 00:40:51.12
for night operations.

565
00:40:51.12 --> 00:40:53.84
And this was just, you know,

566
00:40:53.84 --> 00:40:55.88
not gonna spend a bunch of time on this because now

567
00:40:55.88 --> 00:40:58.24
we've got night vision, but what is more important?

568
00:40:58.24 --> 00:40:59.08
What do we talk about?

569
00:40:59.08 --> 00:41:01.12
Talk about night vision versus night night vision.

570
00:41:01.12 --> 00:41:04.12
What I'm talking about is, put your troops

571
00:41:04.12 --> 00:41:06.68
into hard training situations.

572
00:41:06.68 --> 00:41:08.20
That's what you need to do.

573
00:41:08.20 --> 00:41:11.20
Put your troops into the most difficult of situations

574
00:41:11.20 --> 00:41:12.84
because when you're used to fighting at night,

575
00:41:12.84 --> 00:41:14.56
even a pretty night vision,

576
00:41:14.56 --> 00:41:16.20
if you're used to fighting at night,

577
00:41:16.20 --> 00:41:17.40
number one, yes, you get used to it.

578
00:41:17.40 --> 00:41:19.28
Number two, fighting at the day becomes easy.

579
00:41:21.92 --> 00:41:24.28
It makes fighting at the day become easy.

580
00:41:24.28 --> 00:41:26.48
And it also gives you a potential advantage.

581
00:41:26.48 --> 00:41:28.52
If it just so happens that your competition

582
00:41:28.52 --> 00:41:31.60
isn't willing to put in the hard training at night,

583
00:41:32.72 --> 00:41:34.48
good, you're gonna dominate.

584
00:41:35.60 --> 00:41:36.56
It's the same thing here,

585
00:41:36.56 --> 00:41:37.80
Incoming weather training.

586
00:41:38.92 --> 00:41:40.96
I gotta read this one though, because it's funny.

587
00:41:40.96 --> 00:41:43.20
Adverse weather will inevitably be encountered

588
00:41:43.20 --> 00:41:45.40
and combat and will give rise to problems

589
00:41:45.40 --> 00:41:47.08
that can best be solved by experience.

590
00:41:47.08 --> 00:41:48.56
It will have an impact on a mobility,

591
00:41:48.56 --> 00:41:50.96
on maintenance of vehicle and equipment,

592
00:41:50.96 --> 00:41:53.36
on observation on the availability of tactical air support

593
00:41:53.36 --> 00:41:55.08
and in fact will hinder tactical operations

594
00:41:55.08 --> 00:41:57.24
in every conceivable way.

595
00:41:57.24 --> 00:41:59.40
Adverse weather conditions can be turned into

596
00:41:59.40 --> 00:42:01.28
an asset during battle, however.

597
00:42:01.28 --> 00:42:02.12
Boom, there you go.

598
00:42:02.12 --> 00:42:04.56
So we're already, look, bad weather, good.

599
00:42:06.28 --> 00:42:08.52
Commanders should take every advantage

600
00:42:08.52 --> 00:42:10.44
of training under such conditions.

601
00:42:10.44 --> 00:42:12.08
Troops who have mastered the problems

602
00:42:12.08 --> 00:42:14.56
of operating effectively in spite of the weather

603
00:42:14.56 --> 00:42:17.52
can turn low visibility, extreme height,

604
00:42:17.52 --> 00:42:21.36
biting cold or heavy rain into tactical advantage

605
00:42:21.36 --> 00:42:23.44
against an enemy not so well adapted

606
00:42:23.44 --> 00:42:25.64
to these adverse conditions.

607
00:42:25.64 --> 00:42:28.32
So that's everything you just said, and it's this,

608
00:42:28.32 --> 00:42:32.44
the solution of rainy day schedule is to put on the raincoat

609
00:42:32.44 --> 00:42:34.64
and take full advantage the adverse conditions

610
00:42:34.64 --> 00:42:38.12
for profitable field training and experience.

611
00:42:38.12 --> 00:42:39.56
Totally legit.

612
00:42:39.56 --> 00:42:42.96
You know what's fun in the in the teams?

613
00:42:44.40 --> 00:42:49.40
When there's giant waves like when a massive storm comes

614
00:42:50.24 --> 00:42:54.12
and there's massive just destroyer waves,

615
00:42:54.12 --> 00:42:56.16
it's like time to go out and do surf passage

616
00:42:56.16 --> 00:42:58.80
with the zodiacs and just get annihilated.

617
00:42:58.80 --> 00:43:00.000
It's so fun.

618
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.04
I think that with bud students, oh, it's below.

619
00:43:02.04 --> 00:43:03.88
The waves are freaking just giant cool.

620
00:43:03.88 --> 00:43:05.64
Get your boats, you're going to do surf passage

621
00:43:05.64 --> 00:43:08.52
or sometimes get to get your swim in the teams.

622
00:43:08.52 --> 00:43:09.84
It was a hey, rig up the zodiacs.

623
00:43:09.84 --> 00:43:11.44
We're going to go get some experience and this stuff.

624
00:43:11.44 --> 00:43:13.56
That's which absolutely you have to do.

625
00:43:13.56 --> 00:43:15.60
If you're in the teams and there's big waves

626
00:43:15.60 --> 00:43:18.44
in Coronado or Virginia Beach

627
00:43:18.44 --> 00:43:21.04
and you're not getting shocked up to go get some,

628
00:43:21.04 --> 00:43:23.04
you're wrong, get your platoon together

629
00:43:23.04 --> 00:43:24.84
and get them out there and get them after it.

630
00:43:27.44 --> 00:43:28.72
Cross training for flexibility,

631
00:43:28.72 --> 00:43:30.60
cross training is vital to any organization.

632
00:43:30.60 --> 00:43:32.60
When your personnel are trained in several jobs,

633
00:43:32.60 --> 00:43:34.84
you have achieved depth and capability

634
00:43:34.84 --> 00:43:36.88
that may well split the difference

635
00:43:36.88 --> 00:43:38.60
between success and failure and combat.

636
00:43:40.60 --> 00:43:43.52
Of course, needless switching of personnel

637
00:43:43.52 --> 00:43:45.12
from one job to another is harmful.

638
00:43:45.12 --> 00:43:47.08
So cross train, but that doesn't mean you switch them

639
00:43:47.08 --> 00:43:47.92
completely.

640
00:43:47.92 --> 00:43:50.24
Training personnel and duties other than their primary

641
00:43:50.24 --> 00:43:52.80
MLS, however, will increase your peace time efficiency

642
00:43:52.80 --> 00:43:54.68
and subsequent combat effectiveness.

643
00:43:54.68 --> 00:43:57.68
It will also make the individual a more valuable asset

644
00:43:57.68 --> 00:44:00.04
to the Army increases pride in self confidence

645
00:44:00.04 --> 00:44:02.64
and may well help them qualify for promotion.

646
00:44:02.64 --> 00:44:05.44
But a little time spent cross training

647
00:44:05.44 --> 00:44:09.12
will be amply rewarded in the increased overall

648
00:44:09.12 --> 00:44:10.20
effectiveness of your unit.

649
00:44:10.20 --> 00:44:12.16
Everyone will benefit.

650
00:44:12.16 --> 00:44:13.44
Not the least of you is the commander.

651
00:44:13.44 --> 00:44:14.40
He's throw his that in there.

652
00:44:14.40 --> 00:44:15.04
Everyone's so nice.

653
00:44:15.04 --> 00:44:15.88
Got a little eat.

654
00:44:15.88 --> 00:44:17.72
Let's look south.

655
00:44:17.72 --> 00:44:19.32
Everyone's in the wild.

656
00:44:19.32 --> 00:44:20.96
We hear it.

657
00:44:20.96 --> 00:44:22.92
Got to be something driving this guy to do 45 years

658
00:44:22.92 --> 00:44:24.80
in the Army I reckon.

659
00:44:24.80 --> 00:44:26.20
But he likes that.

660
00:44:26.20 --> 00:44:27.28
Take care of the troops.

661
00:44:27.28 --> 00:44:29.20
Also, a little Benny.

662
00:44:29.20 --> 00:44:31.32
A little side Benny for the man.

663
00:44:34.60 --> 00:44:37.56
Chaining, chain of command, a good organization always has

664
00:44:37.56 --> 00:44:39.36
a smoothly functioning chain of command,

665
00:44:39.36 --> 00:44:41.40
a sound training program properly supervised

666
00:44:41.40 --> 00:44:43.08
can be the primary means of developing

667
00:44:43.08 --> 00:44:46.04
the proper functioning of the chain of command,

668
00:44:46.04 --> 00:44:46.88
which is also essential.

669
00:44:46.88 --> 00:44:49.04
And combat, a good commander will guide the development

670
00:44:49.04 --> 00:44:50.92
of his unit to ensure that subordinate

671
00:44:50.92 --> 00:44:54.32
commanders retain and use their authority and responsibility

672
00:44:54.32 --> 00:44:55.24
in any unit.

673
00:44:55.24 --> 00:44:57.88
The non-commissioner officer plays a leading role.

674
00:44:57.88 --> 00:44:59.56
That's your front line managers.

675
00:44:59.56 --> 00:45:01.96
He must be carefully instructed given responsibility

676
00:45:01.96 --> 00:45:03.32
in the held accountable.

677
00:45:03.32 --> 00:45:05.56
I frequently find squad beaters,

678
00:45:05.56 --> 00:45:09.000
ignoring their team leaders by issuing orders,

679
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.40
giving fire commands and taking other actions

680
00:45:11.40 --> 00:45:14.24
directly with the individual members of the squad.

681
00:45:14.24 --> 00:45:16.44
Even worse, I found responsible officers

682
00:45:16.44 --> 00:45:19.04
who were condoning these mistakes.

683
00:45:19.04 --> 00:45:21.08
The squad leaders should use his team leaders

684
00:45:21.08 --> 00:45:24.04
to exercise control over the squad at all times.

685
00:45:25.40 --> 00:45:28.40
Commanders should supervise a soul battle drill

686
00:45:28.40 --> 00:45:30.76
and squad exercise to ensure that squad leaders

687
00:45:30.76 --> 00:45:34.76
understand and apply the principle of exercising command

688
00:45:34.76 --> 00:45:37.12
over the rifle squad through designated team leaders.

689
00:45:37.12 --> 00:45:38.84
So don't throw the chain of command.

690
00:45:38.84 --> 00:45:40.36
Let your subordinate leaders lead.

691
00:45:43.52 --> 00:45:45.40
Self-sufficiency and confidence confidence

692
00:45:45.40 --> 00:45:48.60
to fight semi-independently under conditions

693
00:45:48.60 --> 00:45:53.04
of decentralized control is developed by training exercises.

694
00:45:53.04 --> 00:45:55.04
Current concepts of warfare,

695
00:45:55.04 --> 00:45:57.36
visualizing greater dispersion on the battlefield.

696
00:45:57.36 --> 00:45:59.64
So we're more spread out, dictate the necessity

697
00:45:59.64 --> 00:46:03.24
for units to acquire self-confidence and self-sufficiency.

698
00:46:03.24 --> 00:46:06.20
These aspects can be developed in most tactical exercises

699
00:46:06.20 --> 00:46:08.92
and can be furthered through realistic use

700
00:46:08.92 --> 00:46:11.80
of active aggressor forces.

701
00:46:14.80 --> 00:46:16.40
Force on force training.

702
00:46:16.40 --> 00:46:18.76
That's what we want to do.

703
00:46:18.76 --> 00:46:21.68
Ranger type operations also instill confidence

704
00:46:21.68 --> 00:46:24.12
and show the need for self-sufficiency.

705
00:46:24.12 --> 00:46:28.12
When out of physical contact with friendly forces

706
00:46:28.12 --> 00:46:31.12
or beyond the range of mutual fire support,

707
00:46:31.12 --> 00:46:33.36
so we're not covering and moving anymore,

708
00:46:33.36 --> 00:46:35.76
the isolated unit becomes a problem.

709
00:46:37.04 --> 00:46:39.48
And our training commander should recognize

710
00:46:39.48 --> 00:46:41.88
the plight of the isolated unit,

711
00:46:41.88 --> 00:46:43.60
not by simulating it,

712
00:46:43.60 --> 00:46:45.92
but by actually demonstrating it.

713
00:46:45.92 --> 00:46:47.48
When the small unit is confronted

714
00:46:47.48 --> 00:46:50.36
with an isolated mission, confidence can always be instilled

715
00:46:50.36 --> 00:46:52.48
by ensuring that procedures are established

716
00:46:52.48 --> 00:46:54.52
for maintaining communications and for rallying

717
00:46:54.52 --> 00:46:56.72
to its support if required.

718
00:46:57.96 --> 00:47:01.56
Training should be aimed at developing integrated procedures

719
00:47:01.56 --> 00:47:03.32
for the employment of Army aviation

720
00:47:03.32 --> 00:47:05.64
and Air Force troop carrier troop movements

721
00:47:05.64 --> 00:47:07.20
for resupply and medical evacuation.

722
00:47:07.20 --> 00:47:11.44
So we have to learn to work independently,

723
00:47:11.44 --> 00:47:15.40
but we always have to be able to support each other.

724
00:47:15.40 --> 00:47:17.16
We're alone out on the battlefield, we die.

725
00:47:17.16 --> 00:47:18.48
You mean there's a balance there?

726
00:47:18.48 --> 00:47:19.80
There's a balance.

727
00:47:19.80 --> 00:47:22.64
There is a little dichotomy, but cover move.

728
00:47:23.76 --> 00:47:25.76
There's another doctrinal term that I love

729
00:47:25.76 --> 00:47:27.80
is supporting distance.

730
00:47:27.80 --> 00:47:30.40
I'm not allowed to be further away from Dave.

731
00:47:30.40 --> 00:47:35.40
If I can't defend Dave's position or cover for Dave

732
00:47:35.40 --> 00:47:37.80
because he's out of the range of my weapon systems,

733
00:47:37.80 --> 00:47:38.72
he's too far away.

734
00:47:40.04 --> 00:47:41.84
That's a perfect example of the cross-training

735
00:47:41.84 --> 00:47:42.68
he's talking about.

736
00:47:42.68 --> 00:47:43.92
I could be an infantryman.

737
00:47:43.92 --> 00:47:47.20
Do I need to be an expert on indirect fires?

738
00:47:47.20 --> 00:47:50.24
No, I probably don't need to know how to field strip every little,

739
00:47:50.24 --> 00:47:52.80
but you don't need to know how far that thing can shoot.

740
00:47:52.80 --> 00:47:55.24
Because if I get too far away from that supporting element

741
00:47:55.24 --> 00:47:57.48
and I go, well, the reason I got too far away

742
00:47:57.48 --> 00:48:00.20
is I didn't know how mortars worked.

743
00:48:00.20 --> 00:48:02.84
Cool, the outcome is your team gets annihilated.

744
00:48:02.84 --> 00:48:04.96
So do I need to know every single thing

745
00:48:04.96 --> 00:48:06.44
that the mortarple student commander knows?

746
00:48:06.44 --> 00:48:08.20
No, you don't, but you gotta know a little bit.

747
00:48:08.20 --> 00:48:10.36
You gotta know how you and you interact together.

748
00:48:10.36 --> 00:48:12.16
And so even that idea of cross-training is,

749
00:48:12.16 --> 00:48:14.16
if you don't have a sort of a functional understanding

750
00:48:14.16 --> 00:48:15.92
inside your company, use the example

751
00:48:15.92 --> 00:48:20.04
before of the salespeople and the customer satisfaction people.

752
00:48:20.04 --> 00:48:22.04
If you're a sales lead,

753
00:48:22.04 --> 00:48:24.08
and the only metric you measure for success

754
00:48:24.08 --> 00:48:25.88
is how much you sell,

755
00:48:25.88 --> 00:48:28.08
and you don't realize that in the return department,

756
00:48:28.08 --> 00:48:30.52
that number is the same, you're losing.

757
00:48:30.52 --> 00:48:32.76
You're losing because there's a piece that you don't,

758
00:48:32.76 --> 00:48:34.24
do you have to know everything they know?

759
00:48:34.24 --> 00:48:35.92
You don't, and actually you don't have time

760
00:48:35.92 --> 00:48:36.92
to know everything you know,

761
00:48:36.92 --> 00:48:38.000
but you gotta know enough.

762
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.48
You gotta have enough understanding

763
00:48:39.48 --> 00:48:41.92
what's going on there to measure the success

764
00:48:41.92 --> 00:48:44.04
of the entire organization to include your team,

765
00:48:44.04 --> 00:48:45.80
and that requires a little bit of cross-training.

766
00:48:45.80 --> 00:48:49.32
And that is a perfect example of how come you need to know

767
00:48:49.32 --> 00:48:50.96
something about everybody.

768
00:48:54.08 --> 00:48:56.04
Small unit tactical exercises.

769
00:48:56.04 --> 00:48:58.000
Tactical exercises should be,

770
00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.84
as well prepared as training tests.

771
00:48:59.84 --> 00:49:00.72
As often as possible,

772
00:49:00.72 --> 00:49:02.44
the tactical situation for a field exercise

773
00:49:02.44 --> 00:49:05.04
should be laid in the framework of an echelon,

774
00:49:05.04 --> 00:49:07.84
one or two levels higher than participating unit.

775
00:49:07.84 --> 00:49:09.64
This is desirable to bring into play

776
00:49:09.64 --> 00:49:11.52
the necessary intelligence supply

777
00:49:11.52 --> 00:49:14.68
of evacuation in similar roles of supporting forces

778
00:49:14.68 --> 00:49:17.40
that have a bearing on the specific tactical operation.

779
00:49:17.40 --> 00:49:19.48
Don't confuse the squad leader however,

780
00:49:19.48 --> 00:49:21.80
by giving him everything that was

781
00:49:21.80 --> 00:49:24.68
in the battalion and company commanders orders.

782
00:49:24.68 --> 00:49:28.76
That's an interesting little point to bring up

783
00:49:28.76 --> 00:49:32.28
is that, well, they're saying that you need to test

784
00:49:32.28 --> 00:49:33.74
the subordinate unit, so you know,

785
00:49:33.74 --> 00:49:35.84
subordinate leadership unit, you can't just,

786
00:49:35.84 --> 00:49:37.92
and this is true in the SEAL teams,

787
00:49:37.92 --> 00:49:39.56
I can't test myself.

788
00:49:39.56 --> 00:49:44.56
If I'm relying on me as the platoon leader to test my platoon,

789
00:49:44.96 --> 00:49:46.72
it's very difficult to do that.

790
00:49:46.72 --> 00:49:47.80
Look, and it can happen,

791
00:49:47.80 --> 00:49:49.36
and there's some great platoon leaders that'll be able

792
00:49:49.36 --> 00:49:52.28
to do that, but there's platoon leaders that will,

793
00:49:52.28 --> 00:49:55.12
they'll pass every test for some reason with flying colors,

794
00:49:55.12 --> 00:49:57.64
because they're not really being tested.

795
00:49:57.64 --> 00:50:01.64
So it's good when you are utilizing the chain of command

796
00:50:01.64 --> 00:50:06.32
and some of the elements above to test the elements below.

797
00:50:06.32 --> 00:50:10.84
So that makes sense, again, he always emphasizes

798
00:50:10.84 --> 00:50:13.64
all exercises to be conducted under simulated combat conditions.

799
00:50:13.64 --> 00:50:16.12
I think we've covered that one enough.

800
00:50:18.76 --> 00:50:20.76
Despite limitations on our capabilities

801
00:50:20.76 --> 00:50:23.16
to conduct field exercises and combined arms training,

802
00:50:23.16 --> 00:50:24.60
I'm convinced that commanders can always

803
00:50:24.60 --> 00:50:27.52
devise ways and means of achieving essential training

804
00:50:27.52 --> 00:50:30.04
objectives. Now I'll give you an example that.

805
00:50:30.04 --> 00:50:34.32
We would want to have close air support

806
00:50:34.32 --> 00:50:36.60
in our urban environment for training.

807
00:50:36.60 --> 00:50:39.60
We'd want to have an AC 130 overhead.

808
00:50:39.60 --> 00:50:41.56
We'd want to have F-18s overhead.

809
00:50:41.56 --> 00:50:43.76
We'd want to have a Marine Corps fighter squadron

810
00:50:43.76 --> 00:50:45.64
ready to combat drop bombs for us.

811
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.40
That doesn't always happen.

812
00:50:48.40 --> 00:50:52.04
In fact, it's very rare that we would get those live assets.

813
00:50:52.04 --> 00:50:53.04
So what would we do?

814
00:50:53.04 --> 00:50:55.52
We would either bring a pilot,

815
00:50:55.52 --> 00:50:58.24
or we'd bring a J-TAC, a person that was qualified to call,

816
00:50:58.24 --> 00:50:59.72
and we'd put them up on one of the buildings

817
00:50:59.72 --> 00:51:02.20
in our Mount Facility and we'd give them a radio.

818
00:51:02.20 --> 00:51:04.84
And look, it's almost the same thing.

819
00:51:04.84 --> 00:51:07.72
You know, you got a guy that understands how pilots talk

820
00:51:07.72 --> 00:51:10.44
and he imitates a pilot talking on the radio.

821
00:51:10.44 --> 00:51:13.08
And then we would put up simulated explosions to go off

822
00:51:13.08 --> 00:51:15.28
when they dropped the bomb in the right spot.

823
00:51:15.28 --> 00:51:18.28
We would blow something up and they'd get that.

824
00:51:19.68 --> 00:51:21.000
They'd get that satisfaction.

825
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.04
Ha ha ha ha.

826
00:51:22.04 --> 00:51:23.64
In fact, there was a company we were using

827
00:51:23.64 --> 00:51:26.04
that had little model airplanes.

828
00:51:26.04 --> 00:51:27.36
They were actually big model airplanes,

829
00:51:27.36 --> 00:51:30.56
but the model airplanes would fly over

830
00:51:30.56 --> 00:51:32.24
and then explosions would happen.

831
00:51:32.24 --> 00:51:35.36
We kind of went the distance to fake the training realistic.

832
00:51:35.36 --> 00:51:38.36
Launching these, you know, F-18s that would come down

833
00:51:38.36 --> 00:51:42.08
and strafe the city and explosions would go off,

834
00:51:42.08 --> 00:51:43.96
pretty good, but that's a great way to do it.

835
00:51:43.96 --> 00:51:46.92
And what does it cost for me to give the radio

836
00:51:46.92 --> 00:51:49.16
to one of my J-TACs and stay at an building?

837
00:51:49.16 --> 00:51:51.96
It costs $0.00.

838
00:51:51.96 --> 00:51:54.72
What does it cost to get an F-18

839
00:51:54.72 --> 00:51:57.44
to give me, or a section of F-18s

840
00:51:57.44 --> 00:51:59.56
to give me a few hours of support

841
00:51:59.56 --> 00:52:02.88
because what, $100,000?

842
00:52:03.80 --> 00:52:04.64
Yeah.

843
00:52:05.44 --> 00:52:09.64
How much, how much fuel do you burn in an F-18?

844
00:52:09.64 --> 00:52:11.28
In an hour, 10,000 pounds?

845
00:52:11.28 --> 00:52:12.44
Ha ha ha ha ha.

846
00:52:12.44 --> 00:52:14.64
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

847
00:52:14.64 --> 00:52:15.44
Yes.

848
00:52:15.44 --> 00:52:16.28
Check.

849
00:52:17.48 --> 00:52:18.48
Check.

850
00:52:18.64 --> 00:52:19.96
Fffffffffffffff.

851
00:52:19.96 --> 00:52:21.12
Fffffffff.

852
00:52:21.12 --> 00:52:23.20
So there's always ways, figure ways out.

853
00:52:24.48 --> 00:52:27.08
Training exercise should be concluded with a critique

854
00:52:27.08 --> 00:52:29.20
to provide the basis for reviewing the action

855
00:52:29.20 --> 00:52:32.84
to indicate areas requiring additional training emphasis.

856
00:52:32.84 --> 00:52:33.44
Boom.

857
00:52:33.44 --> 00:52:34.44
Deep brief.

858
00:52:34.44 --> 00:52:35.56
Yes, we have to do that.

859
00:52:37.40 --> 00:52:39.72
The use of live ammunition is not authorized.

860
00:52:39.72 --> 00:52:43.000
When the use of live ammunition is not authorized

861
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.12
or practical, or when it's used

862
00:52:45.12 --> 00:52:47.92
violate safety requirements, maximum utilization

863
00:52:47.92 --> 00:52:49.76
should be made of various simulators.

864
00:52:49.76 --> 00:52:50.32
Boom.

865
00:52:50.32 --> 00:52:52.44
Again, I basically couldn't rip that.

866
00:52:52.44 --> 00:52:53.64
You were a religious saint.

867
00:52:53.64 --> 00:52:55.84
Simulators can duplicate the sound of artillery

868
00:52:55.84 --> 00:52:58.20
machine gun smoke flash and most other effects

869
00:52:58.20 --> 00:53:00.48
associated with the noise and conditions of the battlefield,

870
00:53:00.48 --> 00:53:02.28
including just tires burning.

871
00:53:04.52 --> 00:53:09.08
Habitual use of aggressor in the field exercises

872
00:53:09.08 --> 00:53:12.88
is desirable to develop interest and realism.

873
00:53:12.88 --> 00:53:16.56
The training value to the unit functioning in an aggressor role

874
00:53:16.56 --> 00:53:18.12
should not be overlooked.

875
00:53:18.12 --> 00:53:20.28
The adherence to established tactical principles

876
00:53:20.28 --> 00:53:22.80
and techniques by the aggressor forces

877
00:53:22.80 --> 00:53:25.92
will aid the friendly force informing sound tackle

878
00:53:25.92 --> 00:53:26.96
hot habits.

879
00:53:26.96 --> 00:53:29.72
This is why we, in the sealed teams,

880
00:53:29.72 --> 00:53:33.12
picked up so much emphasis on force on force training

881
00:53:33.12 --> 00:53:37.92
using simunition or these high speed laser tag systems

882
00:53:37.92 --> 00:53:38.84
that we had.

883
00:53:38.84 --> 00:53:40.44
This is why.

884
00:53:40.44 --> 00:53:43.08
And that's basically all you guys did at Top Gun.

885
00:53:43.08 --> 00:53:46.20
It's 100% aggressor.

886
00:53:46.20 --> 00:53:48.20
And as an aggressor, what do you find at F-16?

887
00:53:48.20 --> 00:53:49.04
Yeah.

888
00:53:52.04 --> 00:53:55.04
How long does it take you to learn to fly at F-16?

889
00:53:55.04 --> 00:53:55.88
Not long.

890
00:53:55.88 --> 00:53:56.72
A couple months.

891
00:53:56.72 --> 00:54:00.28
If that part of it is not that hard.

892
00:54:00.28 --> 00:54:02.16
Are you worried when you go back to an F-18

893
00:54:02.16 --> 00:54:04.52
that you're going to have bad habits?

894
00:54:04.52 --> 00:54:06.04
There's something called negative transfer.

895
00:54:06.04 --> 00:54:09.60
So there's a couple of things that you got to pay attention to.

896
00:54:09.60 --> 00:54:11.000
You got to know that there are some differences

897
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.40
that if you get those wrong, those can be really bad.

898
00:54:13.40 --> 00:54:16.24
But most of it transfers over pretty easily.

899
00:54:16.24 --> 00:54:18.36
The larger issue, like you were talking about.

900
00:54:18.36 --> 00:54:22.24
And my first real job at Top Gun was what's called

901
00:54:22.24 --> 00:54:23.44
the adversary officer.

902
00:54:23.44 --> 00:54:25.16
So my responsibility was to make sure

903
00:54:25.16 --> 00:54:27.76
that all the training scenarios that we developed

904
00:54:27.76 --> 00:54:29.04
at Top Gun on that same day.

905
00:54:29.04 --> 00:54:30.68
That's the good name to give some of the people

906
00:54:30.68 --> 00:54:31.68
that we work with.

907
00:54:31.68 --> 00:54:34.48
You're working with a company and you're like,

908
00:54:34.48 --> 00:54:35.32
oh, you know what?

909
00:54:35.32 --> 00:54:37.84
Maybe we'll just call you the adversarial officer.

910
00:54:37.84 --> 00:54:38.68
The adversarial officer.

911
00:54:38.68 --> 00:54:40.76
There's certainly people that we work with.

912
00:54:40.76 --> 00:54:44.20
We're thinking, man, go, you're working with a company.

913
00:54:44.20 --> 00:54:48.64
You think, hey, when I bring you into where I bring up

914
00:54:48.64 --> 00:54:51.68
your name, all I hear is like, bad things.

915
00:54:51.68 --> 00:54:53.08
This is not a good idea.

916
00:54:53.08 --> 00:54:54.08
What are you doing?

917
00:54:54.08 --> 00:54:55.20
What's going on over here?

918
00:54:55.20 --> 00:54:57.52
Are you the adversarial officer here?

919
00:54:57.52 --> 00:54:59.64
So sorry, cut you off.

920
00:54:59.64 --> 00:55:01.64
No, no, I just say, you know, we were talking about

921
00:55:01.64 --> 00:55:03.80
the challenge of that is the adversarial officer.

922
00:55:03.80 --> 00:55:06.48
Adversary officers job is to make sure

923
00:55:06.48 --> 00:55:08.20
that the training scenarios that we built

924
00:55:08.20 --> 00:55:09.20
on the adversary side.

925
00:55:09.20 --> 00:55:13.000
So the opposing force was realistic and reflected

926
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.16
the capability of the enemy.

927
00:55:14.16 --> 00:55:18.12
So we provided real training for the blue students,

928
00:55:18.12 --> 00:55:20.56
for the friendly fighters going out to fight,

929
00:55:20.56 --> 00:55:22.24
because if they went out and fought an enemy

930
00:55:22.24 --> 00:55:24.56
that wasn't performing the way a real enemy would,

931
00:55:24.56 --> 00:55:26.16
they were going to be unprepared.

932
00:55:26.16 --> 00:55:29.92
We had an entire, you know, sell inside of Top Gun,

933
00:55:29.92 --> 00:55:33.64
designed just to learn and study enemy tactics

934
00:55:33.64 --> 00:55:35.24
to make our training more realistic.

935
00:55:35.24 --> 00:55:37.72
How, what is you have, did you have to fly the F-16

936
00:55:37.72 --> 00:55:40.32
a certain way to simulate?

937
00:55:40.32 --> 00:55:43.24
Normally, when we replicated a force on force.

938
00:55:43.24 --> 00:55:45.36
So there is something incremental training.

939
00:55:45.36 --> 00:55:47.84
So at the beginning of some phases of flight training,

940
00:55:47.84 --> 00:55:50.84
we limit the capability of the enemy aircraft

941
00:55:50.84 --> 00:55:53.24
to build, get some building blocks and fundamentals.

942
00:55:53.24 --> 00:55:55.28
But once we get to force on force training

943
00:55:55.28 --> 00:55:56.72
and most of Top Gun is straight up,

944
00:55:56.72 --> 00:56:00.24
just your best game, my best game as the adversary,

945
00:56:00.24 --> 00:56:03.48
I'm flying the F-16 to the Max performance capability.

946
00:56:03.48 --> 00:56:07.24
And how did the Max performance of the F-16

947
00:56:07.24 --> 00:56:10.56
compare to the Max performance of the SU-27

948
00:56:10.56 --> 00:56:12.20
or whichever close aircraft?

949
00:56:12.20 --> 00:56:14.24
So it's not exactly, but close.

950
00:56:14.24 --> 00:56:18.72
And better than a similar aircraft, F-18 against F-18,

951
00:56:18.72 --> 00:56:21.28
me trying to replicate a different airplane,

952
00:56:21.28 --> 00:56:23.36
like at the end of their machines.

953
00:56:23.36 --> 00:56:26.52
Now, a different machine, even if it doesn't fully replicate

954
00:56:26.52 --> 00:56:28.72
the enemy, it does things differently.

955
00:56:28.72 --> 00:56:30.84
And that alone is a really powerful tool

956
00:56:30.84 --> 00:56:33.16
to practice against, because it shows you things,

957
00:56:33.16 --> 00:56:35.16
oh, I can't do that on my machine.

958
00:56:35.16 --> 00:56:37.000
My machine won't do that this airplane can

959
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.20
and have to have a tactic to respond to that.

960
00:56:40.20 --> 00:56:42.72
And my mistaken in that the early 90s

961
00:56:42.72 --> 00:56:45.44
when I went up to Fallen and I would go through

962
00:56:45.44 --> 00:56:47.52
some air wing training, would it be mistaken

963
00:56:47.52 --> 00:56:50.12
to think that they were aircraft up there besides the F-16

964
00:56:50.12 --> 00:56:51.64
that were acting as adversaries?

965
00:56:51.64 --> 00:56:53.56
No, I think you'd be correct.

966
00:56:53.56 --> 00:56:57.36
Did you have any other aircraft besides the F-16?

967
00:56:57.36 --> 00:56:58.52
What would you guys find?

968
00:56:58.52 --> 00:57:01.08
But what other adversary aircraft were available

969
00:57:01.08 --> 00:57:03.60
to your opposing force?

970
00:57:03.60 --> 00:57:05.52
Yeah, the ones that the Navy furnished,

971
00:57:05.52 --> 00:57:08.44
the most common ones for the Navy were the F-5

972
00:57:08.44 --> 00:57:09.76
and the F-16.

973
00:57:09.76 --> 00:57:12.36
But we also had contract air, so we had,

974
00:57:12.36 --> 00:57:14.32
you know, for F-5 freedom fighter?

975
00:57:14.32 --> 00:57:18.76
I, yes, you've got, absolutely,

976
00:57:18.76 --> 00:57:22.56
there was a squadron of F-5s in,

977
00:57:22.56 --> 00:57:25.56
as adversaries in Fallen,

978
00:57:25.56 --> 00:57:27.56
painted like enemy aircraft designed

979
00:57:27.56 --> 00:57:29.08
just to replicate an enemy threat.

980
00:57:29.08 --> 00:57:30.08
I remember those.

981
00:57:30.08 --> 00:57:31.08
Dude, absolutely.

982
00:57:31.08 --> 00:57:32.60
And did they have red stars on them?

983
00:57:32.60 --> 00:57:33.44
They totally did.

984
00:57:33.44 --> 00:57:34.44
I don't remember that.

985
00:57:34.44 --> 00:57:35.44
Absolutely.

986
00:57:35.44 --> 00:57:38.28
I actually, they might, they probably still have them.

987
00:57:38.28 --> 00:57:40.64
And we would outsource to, you know,

988
00:57:40.64 --> 00:57:43.72
we get the Air Force to come bring up some F-15s

989
00:57:43.72 --> 00:57:45.24
that to fly with us for a class.

990
00:57:45.24 --> 00:57:48.64
We get, you know, a contract company to fly,

991
00:57:48.64 --> 00:57:50.96
you know, French morageers and Israeli-Coffeeers,

992
00:57:50.96 --> 00:57:53.56
just whatever was out there to give you,

993
00:57:53.56 --> 00:57:57.000
the student, what we call a dissimilar look.

994
00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.12
F-18s against F-18s is not a great way

995
00:57:59.12 --> 00:58:00.48
to replicate real training.

996
00:58:00.48 --> 00:58:02.64
So you wanna give something that's different.

997
00:58:02.64 --> 00:58:04.56
Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse,

998
00:58:04.56 --> 00:58:06.56
but the fact that it's different

999
00:58:06.56 --> 00:58:09.96
creates much more realistic training.

1000
00:58:09.96 --> 00:58:12.32
Well, why is it when I read about,

1001
00:58:12.32 --> 00:58:15.96
like old school fighter and like test pilots?

1002
00:58:16.96 --> 00:58:19.08
Like reading when we had Dan Patterson on,

1003
00:58:19.08 --> 00:58:20.88
they're just getting in different aircraft.

1004
00:58:20.88 --> 00:58:23.48
They're just flying out to Area 51,

1005
00:58:23.48 --> 00:58:26.20
and just getting in random A-S and aircraft

1006
00:58:26.20 --> 00:58:28.20
and just flying those things.

1007
00:58:28.20 --> 00:58:31.60
Is that because those old school aircraft

1008
00:58:31.60 --> 00:58:34.80
were more similar in terms of the way you fly them?

1009
00:58:34.80 --> 00:58:36.28
No, man, I just think that those guys

1010
00:58:36.28 --> 00:58:37.68
weren't afraid of anything.

1011
00:58:37.68 --> 00:58:38.88
I'm like, I can fly that thing.

1012
00:58:38.88 --> 00:58:40.04
I'm like, whatever.

1013
00:58:40.04 --> 00:58:43.16
No, I think it was, you know,

1014
00:58:43.16 --> 00:58:47.80
one of the coolest things that Dan Patterson talked about

1015
00:58:47.80 --> 00:58:50.28
here on the podcast and just in general was the idea

1016
00:58:50.28 --> 00:58:54.96
that hey, we need to go figure out how this stuff works.

1017
00:58:54.96 --> 00:58:56.12
We need to get in these machines

1018
00:58:56.12 --> 00:58:57.32
and figure out how they work.

1019
00:58:57.32 --> 00:59:01.12
And if we don't, we're gonna go across to Vietnam

1020
00:59:01.12 --> 00:59:02.28
and we're gonna lose,

1021
00:59:02.28 --> 00:59:04.28
because we don't know how those machines work.

1022
00:59:04.28 --> 00:59:06.76
And regulations and restrictions and safety.

1023
00:59:06.76 --> 00:59:08.48
And all these things were forces,

1024
00:59:08.48 --> 00:59:09.72
were counterweights to doing that.

1025
00:59:09.72 --> 00:59:11.36
All the reasons not to doing.

1026
00:59:11.36 --> 00:59:12.20
Was there a risk?

1027
00:59:12.20 --> 00:59:13.68
Yeah, there's a ton of risk.

1028
00:59:13.68 --> 00:59:15.000
That risk did not wait,

1029
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.88
did not wait going to Vietnam and losing.

1030
00:59:16.88 --> 00:59:17.88
And they believed that.

1031
00:59:17.88 --> 00:59:20.36
And they pushed hard against the institution

1032
00:59:20.36 --> 00:59:22.12
to be able to do that.

1033
00:59:22.12 --> 00:59:24.28
Yeah, and you know, the last podcast,

1034
00:59:24.28 --> 00:59:26.68
we were talking about,

1035
00:59:26.68 --> 00:59:28.60
I was talking about the 80s and the 90s.

1036
00:59:28.60 --> 00:59:32.04
And look, when you're in,

1037
00:59:32.04 --> 00:59:33.28
when it's the 80s and the 90s,

1038
00:59:33.28 --> 00:59:35.88
and you've been tasked to do the best you can

1039
00:59:35.88 --> 00:59:39.40
to maintain the spirit of going to war.

1040
00:59:39.40 --> 00:59:42.88
But think of how hard the pushback is against pushing

1041
00:59:42.88 --> 00:59:43.88
the envelope and training.

1042
00:59:43.88 --> 00:59:45.48
When you're saying, listen,

1043
00:59:45.48 --> 00:59:47.92
when you've got, we better push the envelope.

1044
00:59:47.92 --> 00:59:49.64
Otherwise we're gonna go get killed in Vietnam.

1045
00:59:49.64 --> 00:59:50.80
Yep.

1046
00:59:50.80 --> 00:59:56.64
If it's 1994, it's like we better push the envelope.

1047
00:59:56.64 --> 01:00:00.52
Otherwise, then they come back and you say,

1048
01:00:00.52 --> 01:00:01.96
just hey, don't we push the envelope?

1049
01:00:01.96 --> 01:00:02.80
Yeah.

1050
01:00:02.80 --> 01:00:04.52
And it makes, you know, you're like,

1051
01:00:04.52 --> 01:00:05.68
you know, go on it.

1052
01:00:05.68 --> 01:00:06.88
Dude, that was a tough time.

1053
01:00:06.88 --> 01:00:10.24
And if you look at kind of, are, are what we call

1054
01:00:10.24 --> 01:00:11.52
the baseline adversary,

1055
01:00:11.52 --> 01:00:13.96
if you think about countries that would be our adversaries

1056
01:00:13.96 --> 01:00:15.96
now, China, Russia.

1057
01:00:15.96 --> 01:00:18.56
Those countries were not a threat in 1994.

1058
01:00:18.56 --> 01:00:21.76
They're really, the institution had a really hard time

1059
01:00:21.76 --> 01:00:25.000
being convinced that we needed to train hard.

1060
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.12
It was really, it was a much harder cell.

1061
01:00:27.12 --> 01:00:28.92
Now it's a very different environment.

1062
01:00:28.92 --> 01:00:31.40
And you know, selling the training,

1063
01:00:31.40 --> 01:00:34.84
the demonstrating why we need to do this is actually easier.

1064
01:00:34.84 --> 01:00:38.20
Because back then, it was hard to make a compelling case

1065
01:00:38.20 --> 01:00:40.24
why we needed to push the envelope for what?

1066
01:00:41.24 --> 01:00:44.60
And when you guys would look at doing a mission back then,

1067
01:00:44.60 --> 01:00:46.96
what were you thinking the big mission would be?

1068
01:00:48.12 --> 01:00:52.64
The big mission in 1996, when you were thinking,

1069
01:00:52.64 --> 01:00:55.04
all right, there may be a big mission

1070
01:00:55.04 --> 01:00:56.64
that I need to be ready for.

1071
01:00:56.64 --> 01:00:58.16
I mean, I guess we could look at the,

1072
01:00:58.16 --> 01:00:59.80
the Boclins this time.

1073
01:00:59.80 --> 01:01:04.80
Yeah, so the things in near memory were desert storm

1074
01:01:05.56 --> 01:01:10.56
and multiple, you know, the coast of a former Yugoslavia,

1075
01:01:11.36 --> 01:01:14.48
those there was enough of those in there.

1076
01:01:14.48 --> 01:01:16.84
And there was always this, believe it or not,

1077
01:01:16.84 --> 01:01:20.24
it held over there was always this specter of like,

1078
01:01:20.24 --> 01:01:24.000
you know, great competition, you know, Russia and America,

1079
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.08
those type of things.

1080
01:01:25.08 --> 01:01:26.96
So those are always there.

1081
01:01:26.96 --> 01:01:31.12
And there was enough hold over from the kind of the Cold War

1082
01:01:31.12 --> 01:01:32.96
era of leadership, which is the 80s

1083
01:01:32.96 --> 01:01:35.60
and you know, very early 90s was,

1084
01:01:35.60 --> 01:01:37.84
hey, this stuff all travels in sign waves

1085
01:01:37.84 --> 01:01:40.24
and sooner or later, what's going to happen

1086
01:01:40.24 --> 01:01:43.64
is that there are ability, which is obviously we know that.

1087
01:01:43.64 --> 01:01:46.04
And so that specter of that was always there

1088
01:01:46.04 --> 01:01:48.80
and the proliferation of their stuff all throughout Europe

1089
01:01:48.80 --> 01:01:51.000
and, you know, great great work competition type stuff

1090
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.28
was always part of what we did.

1091
01:01:53.28 --> 01:01:58.28
That makes sense and I guess it probably makes sense to think

1092
01:01:59.68 --> 01:02:03.48
that what it was leaning towards in the teams

1093
01:02:03.48 --> 01:02:06.24
back in those days and probably in, you know,

1094
01:02:06.24 --> 01:02:10.28
in the greater ground troops, the ground forces

1095
01:02:10.28 --> 01:02:13.60
was that these, this idea of like going into a sustained

1096
01:02:13.60 --> 01:02:15.84
ground combat was really,

1097
01:02:16.68 --> 01:02:19.72
that route was really, it seemed like a less likely thing

1098
01:02:19.72 --> 01:02:21.12
all the time, less and less likely

1099
01:02:21.12 --> 01:02:22.76
that we were gonna actually, hey, we're gonna,

1100
01:02:22.76 --> 01:02:26.24
if you would have told me in 1995,

1101
01:02:26.24 --> 01:02:31.24
hey, the US year, the frog men of the 2000s

1102
01:02:33.88 --> 01:02:37.16
and the 2010s are gonna do deployment after deployment,

1103
01:02:37.16 --> 01:02:39.52
after deployment after deployment, after deployment,

1104
01:02:39.52 --> 01:02:42.32
to the desert and they're gonna be fighting

1105
01:02:42.32 --> 01:02:47.32
in ground combat sustained for two decades.

1106
01:02:47.32 --> 01:02:50.88
It would have been very, it would have been hard to predict.

1107
01:02:50.88 --> 01:02:55.88
Yeah, but we trained, we trained and then we kept training.

1108
01:02:59.60 --> 01:03:02.12
Next little section, testing a unit's proficiency,

1109
01:03:02.12 --> 01:03:04.32
the chief objective of readiness training is to ensure

1110
01:03:04.32 --> 01:03:06.48
that all units are maintained at a high rate

1111
01:03:06.48 --> 01:03:08.88
of operational readiness throughout the year.

1112
01:03:08.88 --> 01:03:11.88
That is that every unit is prepared to carry out

1113
01:03:11.88 --> 01:03:13.60
its combat mission at any time.

1114
01:03:13.60 --> 01:03:15.40
Operational readiness testing to determine

1115
01:03:15.40 --> 01:03:16.32
your unit's operational,

1116
01:03:16.32 --> 01:03:20.28
Teddy, operational readiness, you must provide testing.

1117
01:03:20.28 --> 01:03:23.64
Any kind of talks about what to cover

1118
01:03:23.64 --> 01:03:24.64
is a minimum amount.

1119
01:03:25.84 --> 01:03:27.16
He talks about, you gotta, you know,

1120
01:03:27.16 --> 01:03:29.20
these various abilities, the ability to rendezvous,

1121
01:03:29.20 --> 01:03:30.32
the ability to shoot movement,

1122
01:03:30.32 --> 01:03:32.60
come here, hey, all good.

1123
01:03:32.60 --> 01:03:35.36
And he talks about, for best results,

1124
01:03:35.36 --> 01:03:37.52
readiness test should be unannounced,

1125
01:03:37.52 --> 01:03:40.12
which I totally agree with.

1126
01:03:40.12 --> 01:03:42.24
These test should be practical demonstrations

1127
01:03:42.24 --> 01:03:44.80
of how successfully a unit can be expected

1128
01:03:44.80 --> 01:03:48.32
to execute all or any part of its emergency mission,

1129
01:03:48.32 --> 01:03:50.56
totally get now.

1130
01:03:50.56 --> 01:03:55.56
Here's where, here's where testing can concern me.

1131
01:03:57.16 --> 01:04:01.36
When we do a test, we kind of have to give,

1132
01:04:01.36 --> 01:04:03.32
hey, here's the task condition in standard, right?

1133
01:04:03.32 --> 01:04:04.76
Here's what you're gonna be told to do,

1134
01:04:04.76 --> 01:04:08.72
here's the standard, and here's what you need to do it, right?

1135
01:04:08.72 --> 01:04:10.16
Or sorry, here's the task, right?

1136
01:04:10.16 --> 01:04:11.76
This is what you have to do, here's the conditions

1137
01:04:11.76 --> 01:04:15.48
of that task, and here's the standard that you have to meet.

1138
01:04:15.48 --> 01:04:20.48
I was working with a government agency,

1139
01:04:20.76 --> 01:04:24.08
and one of the tasks of this government agency

1140
01:04:24.08 --> 01:04:28.40
was they had to be able to interdict vessels, small vessels.

1141
01:04:29.60 --> 01:04:32.80
And so in order to interdict these vessels,

1142
01:04:32.80 --> 01:04:37.80
they may have to disable the motor of that vessel.

1143
01:04:38.36 --> 01:04:42.80
And so they had to be able to shoot a weapon

1144
01:04:42.80 --> 01:04:45.12
from a moving vessel that they're in,

1145
01:04:45.12 --> 01:04:47.88
add another moving vessel to disable an engine.

1146
01:04:49.44 --> 01:04:50.72
Okay, got it.

1147
01:04:50.72 --> 01:04:53.72
So over time that became a qualification

1148
01:04:53.72 --> 01:04:56.24
that you had to get, and over time it became a test

1149
01:04:56.24 --> 01:05:00.04
that you had to be able to successfully complete this test,

1150
01:05:00.04 --> 01:05:02.52
in order to maintain this qualification to do it.

1151
01:05:02.52 --> 01:05:04.04
And here's the thing.

1152
01:05:05.80 --> 01:05:08.24
One of the guys that had this standard

1153
01:05:08.24 --> 01:05:09.76
was telling me about the test,

1154
01:05:09.76 --> 01:05:11.56
and he was complaining about the test.

1155
01:05:11.56 --> 01:05:13.44
And what had happened was this test,

1156
01:05:13.44 --> 01:05:15.64
the task condition in standards,

1157
01:05:16.64 --> 01:05:21.32
were so controlled that there was no realism to it whatsoever.

1158
01:05:21.32 --> 01:05:26.08
And it was okay, the target vessel will have

1159
01:05:26.08 --> 01:05:29.44
a target on that vessel that is whatever,

1160
01:05:29.44 --> 01:05:31.64
three feet by three feet,

1161
01:05:31.64 --> 01:05:35.76
the vessel will be moving in XC state,

1162
01:05:35.76 --> 01:05:36.84
which was no waves,

1163
01:05:36.84 --> 01:05:38.72
they basically would do only do it

1164
01:05:38.72 --> 01:05:40.96
if there was no waves happening whatsoever.

1165
01:05:40.96 --> 01:05:43.92
And it will be moving at five knots,

1166
01:05:43.92 --> 01:05:47.64
and the assault vessel will also be moving at five knots.

1167
01:05:47.64 --> 01:05:50.28
The distance will be 14 feet,

1168
01:05:50.28 --> 01:05:51.52
and it was just this whole thing.

1169
01:05:51.52 --> 01:05:54.44
And so basically, it took zero skill to do it.

1170
01:05:54.44 --> 01:05:55.80
It took zero skill,

1171
01:05:55.80 --> 01:06:00.80
it was basically a 20 foot shot at a nice big target,

1172
01:06:00.80 --> 01:06:02.52
and it didn't prove anything.

1173
01:06:02.52 --> 01:06:04.60
With the reality of shooting an engine,

1174
01:06:04.60 --> 01:06:06.96
to get an engine to go down on an outboard motor,

1175
01:06:06.96 --> 01:06:08.68
it's a pretty tough thing, it's C state at night.

1176
01:06:08.68 --> 01:06:09.96
There's a lot of things going on.

1177
01:06:09.96 --> 01:06:12.96
And by the way, what weapons do you have?

1178
01:06:12.96 --> 01:06:16.12
Because if you have, if you've got a laser on your weapon

1179
01:06:16.12 --> 01:06:17.64
and it's at night, you've got night vision on,

1180
01:06:17.64 --> 01:06:19.24
and you can train your laser on that

1181
01:06:19.24 --> 01:06:20.72
and you're at a C state and you can keep it steady,

1182
01:06:20.72 --> 01:06:22.44
you can fire a few rounds, cool.

1183
01:06:23.76 --> 01:06:26.12
I worry about testing sometimes,

1184
01:06:26.12 --> 01:06:29.16
because when you put tasks, conditions and standards,

1185
01:06:29.16 --> 01:06:30.64
so that you can provide a test,

1186
01:06:30.64 --> 01:06:34.40
oftentimes those restrict the environment

1187
01:06:34.40 --> 01:06:36.56
and they make it canned.

1188
01:06:36.56 --> 01:06:41.56
And when things become canned, you're not testing

1189
01:06:41.68 --> 01:06:43.28
on what you want to test on.

1190
01:06:43.28 --> 01:06:44.60
So I would always, you know,

1191
01:06:44.60 --> 01:06:48.52
sort of have testing things, then I'd have the real test.

1192
01:06:48.52 --> 01:06:51.20
You know, which is gonna be me, I'm,

1193
01:06:51.20 --> 01:06:53.20
it's gonna be me, I'm, and that's what we wanna see.

1194
01:06:53.20 --> 01:06:54.48
How do you handle the me, I'm?

1195
01:06:55.84 --> 01:06:58.76
When you have night vision on and a laser,

1196
01:07:00.64 --> 01:07:03.80
if you don't have night vision on, can you still see that laser?

1197
01:07:03.80 --> 01:07:05.56
There's lasers that you can see,

1198
01:07:05.56 --> 01:07:07.44
and there's lasers that you cannot see.

1199
01:07:07.44 --> 01:07:10.20
So you could have a laser without night vision,

1200
01:07:10.20 --> 01:07:12.24
that's a red laser, it's like what you see in the movies.

1201
01:07:12.24 --> 01:07:14.000
Are you familiar with movies?

1202
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.28
Oh yeah, come on later, one.

1203
01:07:15.28 --> 01:07:19.32
So you get laser where you, where you can see the little red dot?

1204
01:07:19.32 --> 01:07:20.16
Yes sir.

1205
01:07:20.16 --> 01:07:21.000
That's a visible laser.

1206
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.40
There's also IR lasers in for red lasers

1207
01:07:23.40 --> 01:07:25.40
that you can't see without night vision on,

1208
01:07:25.40 --> 01:07:29.72
but with night vision on, it's, it's actually insanely bright

1209
01:07:29.72 --> 01:07:30.56
and clear.

1210
01:07:30.56 --> 01:07:33.68
And then they have something that's an IR flood,

1211
01:07:33.68 --> 01:07:36.60
which so you can actually are lighting up the entire target area

1212
01:07:36.60 --> 01:07:38.56
with, so it's illuminated,

1213
01:07:38.56 --> 01:07:41.24
and then there's a laser right in the center of it.

1214
01:07:41.24 --> 01:07:43.72
And then you can see that without goggles.

1215
01:07:43.72 --> 01:07:45.16
Nope, you need goggles.

1216
01:07:45.16 --> 01:07:47.60
The equivalent to that would be just a regular flashlight,

1217
01:07:47.60 --> 01:07:49.88
which we also have where you press a button

1218
01:07:49.88 --> 01:07:51.80
and a flashlight comes on, and in the center

1219
01:07:51.80 --> 01:07:53.04
of that flashlight there's a red laser.

1220
01:07:53.04 --> 01:07:54.04
Gotcha.

1221
01:07:54.04 --> 01:07:55.04
Okay, so I'll do it.

1222
01:07:55.04 --> 01:07:56.92
Okay, you have all of that in your life.

1223
01:07:56.92 --> 01:07:59.52
You have all that, you have all that on your weapon all the time.

1224
01:07:59.52 --> 01:08:00.36
Oh dang, okay.

1225
01:08:00.36 --> 01:08:01.20
So the whole deal.

1226
01:08:01.20 --> 01:08:03.96
That's why when you see guys weapons now,

1227
01:08:03.96 --> 01:08:05.32
it gets too hot, it's too hot.

1228
01:08:05.32 --> 01:08:07.48
There's a lot of stuff going on on weapons.

1229
01:08:07.48 --> 01:08:08.44
I did get better, you know,

1230
01:08:08.44 --> 01:08:10.16
because all these little pieces are getting smaller

1231
01:08:10.16 --> 01:08:12.56
and they're consolidating some of these pieces,

1232
01:08:12.56 --> 01:08:15.32
so it's one piece instead of three different pieces.

1233
01:08:15.32 --> 01:08:18.52
You know, now you can get like a grip

1234
01:08:18.52 --> 01:08:22.20
that has a white light and a red laser in it.

1235
01:08:22.20 --> 01:08:23.28
And the batteries.

1236
01:08:23.28 --> 01:08:25.04
There was a time where you had the battery thing

1237
01:08:25.04 --> 01:08:26.40
and then you had the laser thing

1238
01:08:26.40 --> 01:08:28.24
and then you had a battery for the flashlight thing

1239
01:08:28.24 --> 01:08:30.08
and you're gonna wires going all over the place.

1240
01:08:30.08 --> 01:08:31.40
There's a total of gut check.

1241
01:08:31.40 --> 01:08:34.72
Now it is, people are making stuff more square away.

1242
01:08:34.72 --> 01:08:36.20
What about that one?

1243
01:08:36.20 --> 01:08:37.44
You know, the ones that,

1244
01:08:38.88 --> 01:08:41.04
like you could see the laser through the little lens

1245
01:08:41.04 --> 01:08:42.32
almost kind of thing, you know?

1246
01:08:42.32 --> 01:08:43.80
So that's like, or you can see the dots.

1247
01:08:43.80 --> 01:08:44.64
You could see the dots.

1248
01:08:44.64 --> 01:08:45.48
Yep, yep.

1249
01:08:45.48 --> 01:08:47.28
That's just another type of system.

1250
01:08:47.28 --> 01:08:50.08
And the enemy is not gonna be able to see that.

1251
01:08:50.08 --> 01:08:51.48
But you guys don't have those.

1252
01:08:51.48 --> 01:08:52.48
No, we have those too.

1253
01:08:52.48 --> 01:08:53.32
On the deal.

1254
01:08:53.32 --> 01:08:54.16
Okay.

1255
01:08:54.16 --> 01:08:55.000
And the team's got everything.

1256
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:55.84
It's pretty awesome.

1257
01:08:55.84 --> 01:08:57.48
Actually, what guys are doing now,

1258
01:08:57.48 --> 01:08:58.48
that's really cool,

1259
01:08:58.48 --> 01:09:01.000
because it's sort of getting next level,

1260
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000
the way that the technology is just really getting

1261
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.24
so much better right now.

1262
01:09:07.24 --> 01:09:08.08
High speed.

1263
01:09:08.08 --> 01:09:09.36
Yeah, it's getting way more high speed

1264
01:09:09.36 --> 01:09:12.40
and the guys systems are much better than they were,

1265
01:09:12.40 --> 01:09:13.40
you know?

1266
01:09:13.40 --> 01:09:18.40
I mean, the changes that took place

1267
01:09:18.40 --> 01:09:23.40
from Vietnam to 1995 is tiny.

1268
01:09:25.64 --> 01:09:28.44
Compared to the changes that took place last year.

1269
01:09:28.44 --> 01:09:30.88
You know, this is exponentially better

1270
01:09:30.88 --> 01:09:31.72
weapon systems.

1271
01:09:31.72 --> 01:09:33.72
And not so much the weapon system,

1272
01:09:33.72 --> 01:09:37.40
but the accoutrements that you put on the weapon systems

1273
01:09:37.40 --> 01:09:39.32
are way better.

1274
01:09:39.32 --> 01:09:42.68
I mean, I get kind of crazy when I'm watching

1275
01:09:42.68 --> 01:09:44.76
like some of the new technologies coming out of the awesome,

1276
01:09:44.76 --> 01:09:45.60
awesome to see.

1277
01:09:48.96 --> 01:09:51.84
Next little section is, and by the way,

1278
01:09:51.84 --> 01:09:54.52
just I skipped the, you were wondering, Dave,

1279
01:09:54.52 --> 01:09:56.08
I told you I was gonna skip some stuff.

1280
01:09:56.08 --> 01:09:58.80
The stuff that I skipped really goes into like,

1281
01:09:58.80 --> 01:10:03.80
the details of each and every type of unit

1282
01:10:04.36 --> 01:10:05.36
that you can be working with.

1283
01:10:05.36 --> 01:10:08.56
And it goes into some very granular detail,

1284
01:10:08.56 --> 01:10:10.04
good for a military leader,

1285
01:10:11.28 --> 01:10:13.36
but a little bit too granular

1286
01:10:13.36 --> 01:10:15.76
for general public consumption.

1287
01:10:15.76 --> 01:10:18.56
And I haven't actually started the execution

1288
01:10:18.56 --> 01:10:20.12
of publishing this thing on my own.

1289
01:10:20.12 --> 01:10:21.72
I'm obviously gonna need to.

1290
01:10:21.72 --> 01:10:24.52
This needs to be a jockel publishing book.

1291
01:10:24.52 --> 01:10:29.52
So I gotta, I guess I gotta figure out the legality that.

1292
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.52
I think the legality is none.

1293
01:10:32.52 --> 01:10:34.28
I think it's more than 50 years old,

1294
01:10:34.28 --> 01:10:36.12
which means it's public domain.

1295
01:10:36.12 --> 01:10:38.44
So I'll write a little forward to it.

1296
01:10:39.76 --> 01:10:41.36
And we'll go from there.

1297
01:10:41.36 --> 01:10:42.36
Go Dave.

1298
01:10:42.36 --> 01:10:45.20
Yeah, I was writing a note that maybe I'll write the forward.

1299
01:10:45.20 --> 01:10:48.44
The cool thing about the theme of this

1300
01:10:48.44 --> 01:10:53.20
is that you've traced this back to the influence on you

1301
01:10:53.20 --> 01:10:56.64
and the influence of the influencer on you.

1302
01:10:56.64 --> 01:10:58.64
Well, there's now another layer here.

1303
01:10:58.64 --> 01:11:03.64
Oh, one more layer deep of where we are all pulling this from,

1304
01:11:03.64 --> 01:11:05.60
which is you recounting where you pulled it from.

1305
01:11:05.60 --> 01:11:07.28
And now you're actually connected to where

1306
01:11:07.28 --> 01:11:08.20
hack pulled it from.

1307
01:11:08.20 --> 01:11:10.96
So, check.

1308
01:11:10.96 --> 01:11:13.24
All right, sounds like the next jockel publishing book

1309
01:11:13.24 --> 01:11:16.04
has been delineated.

1310
01:11:16.04 --> 01:11:17.08
You know what's interesting?

1311
01:11:17.08 --> 01:11:19.20
So the name of this and I brought this up already,

1312
01:11:19.20 --> 01:11:22.32
but it's a stack poll publications.

1313
01:11:22.32 --> 01:11:25.28
And by the way, stack poll publications, you're welcome,

1314
01:11:25.28 --> 01:11:28.12
because I know I've read books from you that you publish.

1315
01:11:28.12 --> 01:11:31.000
One of them I know is another clay pledge in St.

1316
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.48
Low, which we've covered a long time ago,

1317
01:11:32.48 --> 01:11:35.28
to Glover John's which, by the way, is another connection

1318
01:11:35.28 --> 01:11:37.76
back to Hackworth.

1319
01:11:37.76 --> 01:11:38.80
And I talked about it.

1320
01:11:38.80 --> 01:11:42.08
I'm pretty sure some copies of this clay

1321
01:11:42.08 --> 01:11:43.68
pages in St. Low's sold.

1322
01:11:43.68 --> 01:11:46.48
I wrote stack poll books in email.

1323
01:11:46.48 --> 01:11:47.64
And said, hey, I'm here.

1324
01:11:47.64 --> 01:11:48.48
Here's a book.

1325
01:11:48.48 --> 01:11:49.16
I'm trying to find.

1326
01:11:49.16 --> 01:11:52.28
I haven't been able to find it.

1327
01:11:52.28 --> 01:11:56.20
I love to do something right-of-forward,

1328
01:11:56.20 --> 01:11:59.000
you know, republish this thing, whatever.

1329
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.36
Never heard back from them, unfortunately.

1330
01:12:01.36 --> 01:12:04.28
You know, I probably, I don't think I was persistent enough.

1331
01:12:04.28 --> 01:12:06.28
I probably said I'm one, maybe two emails.

1332
01:12:06.28 --> 01:12:08.08
So I probably should have done a better job

1333
01:12:08.08 --> 01:12:12.20
and explain to them maybe better where I was coming from.

1334
01:12:12.20 --> 01:12:15.72
Didn't do a good enough job, but hopefully,

1335
01:12:15.72 --> 01:12:17.96
we'll do something with it.

1336
01:12:17.96 --> 01:12:22.96
So back to this training for contingency operations.

1337
01:12:22.96 --> 01:12:25.56
In addition to being prepared to execute combat missions

1338
01:12:25.56 --> 01:12:27.40
as part of a combined force, units overseas

1339
01:12:27.40 --> 01:12:29.48
must be trained and ready to perform a wide variety

1340
01:12:29.48 --> 01:12:30.84
of contingency operations.

1341
01:12:30.84 --> 01:12:33.24
It is not possible to identify all contingencies

1342
01:12:33.24 --> 01:12:36.000
which may face Army unit stations overseas.

1343
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.96
Generally, a unit that is well trained

1344
01:12:37.96 --> 01:12:41.000
for its basic combat mission will be capable

1345
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
of supporting contingency operations.

1346
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Commanders must be aware, however,

1347
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.40
that their troops may be employed in areas

1348
01:12:47.40 --> 01:12:49.36
where the weather and terrain differ greatly

1349
01:12:49.36 --> 01:12:52.24
from that found in areas in which their station.

1350
01:12:52.24 --> 01:12:55.04
Combat ready elements should be air transportable

1351
01:12:55.04 --> 01:12:57.24
for movement on short, notice to potential trouble areas.

1352
01:12:57.24 --> 01:12:59.76
They should be trained to quail civil disturbances,

1353
01:12:59.76 --> 01:13:03.56
control riots, guard or recover critical installations,

1354
01:13:03.56 --> 01:13:08.000
bolster civil authorities and police provide emergency relief

1355
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.48
from natural disasters and handle numerous other related tasks.

1356
01:13:13.96 --> 01:13:15.64
And imagine Commander can visualize

1357
01:13:15.64 --> 01:13:18.08
appropriate and feasible contingency missions for as unit

1358
01:13:18.08 --> 01:13:20.96
and present it with appropriate training situations.

1359
01:13:20.96 --> 01:13:23.24
Now, here's something that I'll throw in there.

1360
01:13:23.24 --> 01:13:26.12
It says such training will provide variety

1361
01:13:26.12 --> 01:13:27.76
but must be based on logical conditions.

1362
01:13:27.76 --> 01:13:28.92
It'd be realistic.

1363
01:13:28.92 --> 01:13:30.36
The thing that I'll throw in there is,

1364
01:13:31.52 --> 01:13:34.80
since you don't know what these contingencies are,

1365
01:13:34.80 --> 01:13:36.64
you have to train people on what to do

1366
01:13:36.64 --> 01:13:38.32
and they don't know what to do.

1367
01:13:39.28 --> 01:13:41.08
How do you assess a situation?

1368
01:13:41.08 --> 01:13:42.12
How do you look at it?

1369
01:13:42.12 --> 01:13:44.04
How do you look at it with an open mind?

1370
01:13:44.04 --> 01:13:48.80
And that's one of the real benefits of I had

1371
01:13:48.80 --> 01:13:51.64
of growing up in the seal teams is we've lacked doctrine.

1372
01:13:51.64 --> 01:13:53.88
We have more now, man, when I grew,

1373
01:13:53.88 --> 01:13:55.48
when I was got in the teams, there was no,

1374
01:13:55.48 --> 01:13:58.16
there's almost no, there's all word amount.

1375
01:13:58.16 --> 01:14:01.96
And so when you got told, hey, you're going to do this type

1376
01:14:01.96 --> 01:14:04.24
of mission, you just got told word amount of how you're going

1377
01:14:04.24 --> 01:14:04.80
to do it.

1378
01:14:04.80 --> 01:14:06.56
And if it was a type of mission that no one had ever done

1379
01:14:06.56 --> 01:14:08.48
before, we were going to sit there and make up how to do it.

1380
01:14:08.48 --> 01:14:10.72
There was no book to refer to.

1381
01:14:10.72 --> 01:14:14.68
We didn't, and we didn't have, I'll tell you what, we didn't have

1382
01:14:14.68 --> 01:14:16.80
in 1995.

1383
01:14:18.64 --> 01:14:22.76
No one ever said to me, hey, we're doing an assault.

1384
01:14:22.76 --> 01:14:25.40
Here's the army manual of what they do.

1385
01:14:25.40 --> 01:14:26.24
No one ever said that.

1386
01:14:26.24 --> 01:14:31.24
I never saw an army manual in the teams in the 90s.

1387
01:14:33.24 --> 01:14:34.56
It was all word amount.

1388
01:14:37.36 --> 01:14:40.52
So you had to, you have to put people in situations

1389
01:14:40.52 --> 01:14:42.60
where you go, hey, hey, they's a random mission figure out

1390
01:14:42.60 --> 01:14:44.68
how you're going to do this.

1391
01:14:44.68 --> 01:14:45.76
Figure out how you're going to do this.

1392
01:14:45.76 --> 01:14:48.76
And then you see what they do.

1393
01:14:48.76 --> 01:14:50.92
And there are protocols for what to do when you don't know

1394
01:14:50.92 --> 01:14:51.44
what to do.

1395
01:14:55.44 --> 01:14:59.04
Then it gets into this section right here, which is,

1396
01:14:59.04 --> 01:15:00.28
I was like, oh, maybe I'll skip this.

1397
01:15:00.28 --> 01:15:01.48
And then I read like four lines.

1398
01:15:01.48 --> 01:15:03.92
I'm like, all right, this is freaking awesome.

1399
01:15:03.92 --> 01:15:08.92
So guidelines for planning, brigade, and battalion attacks.

1400
01:15:12.56 --> 01:15:17.56
Training, regardless of size of unit has but one purpose.

1401
01:15:18.32 --> 01:15:22.28
That is to teach effectively the techniques of combat.

1402
01:15:22.28 --> 01:15:26.16
The attack is the key to success.

1403
01:15:26.16 --> 01:15:29.40
The defense is merely a temporary expedient

1404
01:15:29.40 --> 01:15:33.04
to conserve forces for an attack elsewhere

1405
01:15:33.04 --> 01:15:35.72
or to prepare for an attack at a future date.

1406
01:15:36.88 --> 01:15:38.72
So the only reason you're going on defense

1407
01:15:38.72 --> 01:15:40.92
is so that you can go back on the attack.

1408
01:15:40.92 --> 01:15:42.08
That's the only reason you're going,

1409
01:15:42.08 --> 01:15:43.32
everything is to attack.

1410
01:15:43.32 --> 01:15:44.16
That's all you're doing.

1411
01:15:44.16 --> 01:15:45.48
You're going to attack.

1412
01:15:45.48 --> 01:15:46.52
Oh, we got to hesitate, cool.

1413
01:15:46.52 --> 01:15:48.28
Where has dating so that we can attack later?

1414
01:15:49.84 --> 01:15:50.68
That's what we're doing.

1415
01:15:50.68 --> 01:15:52.36
We're going to attack.

1416
01:15:52.36 --> 01:15:54.24
The consequences of having an attack

1417
01:15:54.24 --> 01:15:56.16
grind to a halt are great.

1418
01:15:56.16 --> 01:15:59.36
The effort required for it to bounce back is tremendous.

1419
01:15:59.36 --> 01:16:00.64
Once an attack is launched,

1420
01:16:00.64 --> 01:16:03.20
its momentum must be maintained until the objective

1421
01:16:03.20 --> 01:16:05.44
or objectives are seized and secured.

1422
01:16:05.44 --> 01:16:07.92
Battle losses received due to poor planning

1423
01:16:07.92 --> 01:16:10.36
and faulty execution are inexcusable

1424
01:16:10.36 --> 01:16:13.68
and will result in a loss of respect for and confidence

1425
01:16:13.68 --> 01:16:14.76
in the commander.

1426
01:16:16.52 --> 01:16:18.92
The best reputation a commander can have

1427
01:16:18.92 --> 01:16:23.20
is that he accomplishes his missions with few losses.

1428
01:16:26.56 --> 01:16:29.32
The end sought in planning and executing

1429
01:16:29.32 --> 01:16:32.04
an attack is brought about by deliberate planning

1430
01:16:32.04 --> 01:16:34.44
and violent execution.

1431
01:16:34.44 --> 01:16:36.80
The opposite is fatal.

1432
01:16:38.12 --> 01:16:40.52
Speed and planning is often needed,

1433
01:16:40.52 --> 01:16:43.04
but haste should be avoided.

1434
01:16:44.04 --> 01:16:46.88
Remember that in combat, there is no second opportunity

1435
01:16:46.88 --> 01:16:49.20
and seldom opportunity for rehearsals.

1436
01:16:49.20 --> 01:16:52.16
This deliberate planning is accomplished in five phases.

1437
01:16:53.96 --> 01:16:56.44
Phase one, basic factors, principal factors,

1438
01:16:56.44 --> 01:16:58.32
which must be considered by a commander

1439
01:16:58.32 --> 01:17:00.60
in deliberate planning are mission.

1440
01:17:00.60 --> 01:17:04.04
Enemy situation troops available, terrain and weather.

1441
01:17:04.04 --> 01:17:06.16
This is something we all learn basic,

1442
01:17:06.16 --> 01:17:08.76
mission enemy troops available, terrain and weather.

1443
01:17:08.76 --> 01:17:11.04
Phase two, tentative plan of attack.

1444
01:17:12.12 --> 01:17:14.72
How much time do I support it and I have

1445
01:17:14.72 --> 01:17:17.40
for reconnaissance planning and the issuance of order?

1446
01:17:17.40 --> 01:17:19.40
What general scheme and maneuver do I want to employ?

1447
01:17:19.40 --> 01:17:20.84
What formations are feasible?

1448
01:17:20.84 --> 01:17:22.48
What does the mobility of my command?

1449
01:17:22.48 --> 01:17:24.20
How much dispersing can I achieve

1450
01:17:24.20 --> 01:17:27.20
and still accomplish my mission with speed and violence?

1451
01:17:27.20 --> 01:17:30.84
What supporting nuclear fires are planned for

1452
01:17:30.84 --> 01:17:35.36
or are available to me and for adjacent units?

1453
01:17:35.36 --> 01:17:36.04
We're not got to that.

1454
01:17:36.04 --> 01:17:37.56
I'm thinking, wow.

1455
01:17:39.16 --> 01:17:40.32
Wow.

1456
01:17:40.32 --> 01:17:44.60
This is, I think this book is 1962, 1963.

1457
01:17:44.60 --> 01:17:47.80
This is like it's on cold war.

1458
01:17:47.80 --> 01:17:49.04
And we're thinking if I,

1459
01:17:49.04 --> 01:17:50.96
if I'm gonna do an attack, you know what?

1460
01:17:50.96 --> 01:17:53.84
We may bring in some tactical nukes.

1461
01:17:53.84 --> 01:17:59.44
That's where we're at. So these guys are planning

1462
01:17:59.44 --> 01:18:02.000
and thinking and thinking through using

1463
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.52
nuclear weapons on the battlefield.

1464
01:18:07.20 --> 01:18:09.36
How can I employ my conventional fire support?

1465
01:18:09.36 --> 01:18:11.000
That's a secondary thought by the way,

1466
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.84
my primary is going nuke.

1467
01:18:12.84 --> 01:18:14.56
What logistical problems problems do I have?

1468
01:18:14.56 --> 01:18:16.52
Can I support the operation logistically?

1469
01:18:16.52 --> 01:18:18.48
What is the status of personnel and equipment?

1470
01:18:18.48 --> 01:18:21.24
How can I best use my supporting elements to include armor?

1471
01:18:21.24 --> 01:18:23.72
Per armor personnel carriers and helicopters?

1472
01:18:23.72 --> 01:18:26.000
Our communication facilities at adequate.

1473
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.76
Can I communicate with my supporting units?

1474
01:18:27.76 --> 01:18:29.64
Do their radio is net with mine?

1475
01:18:29.64 --> 01:18:31.72
What flank security problems do I have?

1476
01:18:31.72 --> 01:18:33.84
How can I best control the attack?

1477
01:18:33.84 --> 01:18:34.76
From where?

1478
01:18:34.76 --> 01:18:36.16
What control measures?

1479
01:18:36.16 --> 01:18:38.44
What must I be ready to do next when I have seized

1480
01:18:38.44 --> 01:18:40.000
and secured the objective?

1481
01:18:42.32 --> 01:18:43.84
So that's that right there.

1482
01:18:43.84 --> 01:18:46.32
That was the tentative plan of attack.

1483
01:18:47.24 --> 01:18:49.000
And then it goes detail plan of attack,

1484
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.60
having analyzed these factors and having developed

1485
01:18:51.60 --> 01:18:53.64
a tentative plan based on this analysis,

1486
01:18:53.64 --> 01:18:55.80
the commanders ready to get down to details.

1487
01:18:55.80 --> 01:18:57.92
These things must then be considered.

1488
01:18:57.92 --> 01:19:00.68
What is the formation that we will be initially used?

1489
01:19:00.68 --> 01:19:02.56
Mounted dismounted or by helicopter?

1490
01:19:02.56 --> 01:19:04.16
What units will be in the initial attack?

1491
01:19:04.16 --> 01:19:08.000
What units are being supporting or in reserve?

1492
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.92
What will constitute my base of fire?

1493
01:19:09.92 --> 01:19:11.72
Because it's all covered move.

1494
01:19:11.72 --> 01:19:12.76
We're going to have a base of fire,

1495
01:19:12.76 --> 01:19:15.60
we're going to have an element maneuvering.

1496
01:19:15.60 --> 01:19:19.24
We'll forward assembly areas or attack positions

1497
01:19:19.24 --> 01:19:21.44
be used for my attacking troops.

1498
01:19:21.44 --> 01:19:22.40
If so, where?

1499
01:19:22.40 --> 01:19:26.64
When will my components of my fire support start?

1500
01:19:26.64 --> 01:19:27.96
When will we ship fire and stop?

1501
01:19:27.96 --> 01:19:29.16
How will I range for this to happen?

1502
01:19:29.16 --> 01:19:32.72
How can I exploit the effects of my supporting nuclear fires?

1503
01:19:34.52 --> 01:19:37.64
Oh, it's so crazy to think about.

1504
01:19:37.64 --> 01:19:38.48
Yeah.

1505
01:19:42.04 --> 01:19:45.12
From what position will each of my attacking elements

1506
01:19:45.12 --> 01:19:49.92
start their attacking by fire and maneuver?

1507
01:19:49.92 --> 01:19:51.000
Cover and move.

1508
01:19:52.16 --> 01:19:54.16
This is the true line of departure

1509
01:19:54.16 --> 01:19:55.84
and should be considered as such.

1510
01:19:55.84 --> 01:19:56.84
That's an LD.

1511
01:19:58.04 --> 01:20:01.24
There may be other courting lines or points in there.

1512
01:20:01.24 --> 01:20:04.68
How and from what distance will I start a coordinated assault?

1513
01:20:04.68 --> 01:20:07.64
What command signal and contingent will I use to start it?

1514
01:20:07.64 --> 01:20:10.16
What reports will I expect from my subordinate units?

1515
01:20:10.16 --> 01:20:12.08
What reports will I give to my superiors?

1516
01:20:12.08 --> 01:20:14.52
With whom should I establish liaison?

1517
01:20:14.52 --> 01:20:18.96
How when and where should I issue my attack order?

1518
01:20:18.96 --> 01:20:21.56
What arrangements should I make for this?

1519
01:20:21.56 --> 01:20:23.04
And then it gets into the war gaming.

1520
01:20:23.04 --> 01:20:24.64
So the reason I'm going through this is like,

1521
01:20:24.64 --> 01:20:25.96
think of the level of detail.

1522
01:20:25.96 --> 01:20:28.12
Think of the, you know, I got that section of discipline

1523
01:20:28.12 --> 01:20:28.96
equals freedom field man.

1524
01:20:28.96 --> 01:20:30.12
Or I was like, question everything.

1525
01:20:30.12 --> 01:20:31.76
This is it, man.

1526
01:20:31.76 --> 01:20:33.16
What are we doing?

1527
01:20:33.16 --> 01:20:34.60
How are we doing it?

1528
01:20:34.60 --> 01:20:36.52
Having a checklist like this to think about

1529
01:20:36.52 --> 01:20:38.76
before you conduct an operation?

1530
01:20:38.76 --> 01:20:39.88
I don't care if you're at a business.

1531
01:20:39.88 --> 01:20:41.12
I don't care if you're going to grocery store.

1532
01:20:41.12 --> 01:20:44.48
Thinking about what you're going to be facing.

1533
01:20:44.48 --> 01:20:47.48
This is a smart way to operate.

1534
01:20:50.88 --> 01:20:54.08
Phase four, war gaming the plan.

1535
01:20:55.12 --> 01:20:57.64
The commander now having come to a pretty firm idea

1536
01:20:57.64 --> 01:20:59.60
of what he wants to do and how he wants to do it.

1537
01:20:59.60 --> 01:21:01.48
Now war games it in his mind

1538
01:21:01.48 --> 01:21:03.72
and ask himself the following questions.

1539
01:21:04.76 --> 01:21:07.32
This is when you're trying to punch holes in your own plan

1540
01:21:07.32 --> 01:21:08.80
to the maximum extent possible.

1541
01:21:08.80 --> 01:21:10.48
Have I based my plan on knowledge,

1542
01:21:10.48 --> 01:21:13.48
gain through active ground, map,

1543
01:21:13.48 --> 01:21:17.08
and aerial reconnaissance and knowledge of the enemy situation?

1544
01:21:18.08 --> 01:21:20.68
Have I analyzed the enemy defense thoroughly

1545
01:21:20.68 --> 01:21:23.28
thereby locating and taking advantage of weaknesses

1546
01:21:23.28 --> 01:21:25.68
in enemy disposition or terrain

1547
01:21:25.68 --> 01:21:27.48
where the defender cannot use his weapons

1548
01:21:27.48 --> 01:21:29.68
or obstacles to advantage?

1549
01:21:29.68 --> 01:21:32.08
Have I given adequate consideration to terrain

1550
01:21:32.08 --> 01:21:34.28
and whether one affects the have on the accomplishment

1551
01:21:34.28 --> 01:21:34.88
of my mission?

1552
01:21:34.88 --> 01:21:37.08
Have I planned for maximum exploitation

1553
01:21:37.08 --> 01:21:38.88
of available nuclear fires?

1554
01:21:39.88 --> 01:21:42.48
Have I considered troop safety in the planning

1555
01:21:42.48 --> 01:21:45.28
of my nuclear fires and scheme of maneuver?

1556
01:21:45.28 --> 01:21:47.88
Have I considered the use of armored personnel carriers?

1557
01:21:47.88 --> 01:21:50.08
Have I considered the effects of nuclear weapons

1558
01:21:50.08 --> 01:21:52.68
upon the terrain over which I am attacking?

1559
01:21:52.68 --> 01:21:57.08
Blowdown contaminated areas, secondary fires.

1560
01:21:58.68 --> 01:22:00.28
I didn't know what blowdown was.

1561
01:22:00.28 --> 01:22:01.88
I had to look it up, guess where I went.

1562
01:22:01.88 --> 01:22:06.88
I went to FM 100, attack 30 nuclear operations.

1563
01:22:06.88 --> 01:22:07.68
What is it?

1564
01:22:07.68 --> 01:22:11.88
Blowdown is when trees get blown down

1565
01:22:11.88 --> 01:22:15.48
and they're splintered and they create just obstacles

1566
01:22:15.48 --> 01:22:17.28
everywhere, they're very hard to move through.

1567
01:22:17.28 --> 01:22:19.88
So you got to account for that in your assault.

1568
01:22:19.88 --> 01:22:22.88
Got to account for the blowdown of the nuclear weapons

1569
01:22:22.88 --> 01:22:25.08
you used to prep the area for assault?

1570
01:22:28.28 --> 01:22:29.08
Man.

1571
01:22:30.48 --> 01:22:33.68
Have I provided for full shock effect on the enemy?

1572
01:22:33.68 --> 01:22:35.68
This comes from surprise tanks and strengths,

1573
01:22:35.68 --> 01:22:37.08
attacks from several directions,

1574
01:22:37.08 --> 01:22:39.48
simultaneously intensity of supporting fires

1575
01:22:39.48 --> 01:22:41.48
during the assault and the speed of the assault

1576
01:22:41.48 --> 01:22:44.08
by use of armored personnel carriers and helicopters.

1577
01:22:44.08 --> 01:22:47.08
Does my plan provide for the waiting of the main effort?

1578
01:22:47.08 --> 01:22:50.28
Have I used attacking units as a base of fire

1579
01:22:50.28 --> 01:22:54.28
when I have artillery heavy weapons and mortars for this purpose?

1580
01:22:54.28 --> 01:22:56.48
Isn't it crazy that everything is covered move?

1581
01:22:56.48 --> 01:22:59.08
Everything is covered move.

1582
01:22:59.08 --> 01:23:01.28
The use of tanks for this purpose is especially

1583
01:23:01.28 --> 01:23:03.68
faulty if the tanks could be used in the attack role

1584
01:23:03.68 --> 01:23:06.68
to close with the enemy and overrun them.

1585
01:23:06.68 --> 01:23:11.08
Has the excessive use of attack troops as a base of fire

1586
01:23:11.08 --> 01:23:14.88
as reserves or as reconnaissance and security elements

1587
01:23:14.88 --> 01:23:18.68
cause me to have two little strength in the attack?

1588
01:23:18.68 --> 01:23:23.88
Have I selected unnecessary intermediate objectives?

1589
01:23:23.88 --> 01:23:26.08
Which, I don't want to go back to number 10.

1590
01:23:26.08 --> 01:23:27.48
Here.

1591
01:23:28.68 --> 01:23:33.08
Have I used too much of the attack troops in the base of fire?

1592
01:23:33.08 --> 01:23:35.48
So when you have, would be doing assaults,

1593
01:23:35.48 --> 01:23:41.48
like let's say it's a basic seal platoon in the 90s.

1594
01:23:41.48 --> 01:23:43.08
And we'd be doing an assault.

1595
01:23:43.08 --> 01:23:46.48
And so you have a base of fire and then you have an assault element.

1596
01:23:46.48 --> 01:23:50.08
And you could say, okay, squad one,

1597
01:23:50.08 --> 01:23:51.88
you're going to be the base element squad two.

1598
01:23:51.88 --> 01:23:54.08
You're going to be the assault element.

1599
01:23:54.08 --> 01:23:57.28
So squad one, you're going to lay down this base of fire.

1600
01:23:57.28 --> 01:23:59.28
And while you're laying down that base of fire,

1601
01:23:59.28 --> 01:24:01.88
in comes the maneuver element, the assault element

1602
01:24:01.88 --> 01:24:03.48
is going to move into position.

1603
01:24:03.48 --> 01:24:05.28
And then they're going to start going through the target

1604
01:24:05.28 --> 01:24:08.08
and then the base of fire is going to shift off the target.

1605
01:24:08.08 --> 01:24:09.68
But they've suppressed the enemy fire

1606
01:24:09.68 --> 01:24:11.08
and now you can go through pretty clean.

1607
01:24:11.08 --> 01:24:13.08
So there's a tendency to think, well,

1608
01:24:13.08 --> 01:24:14.68
you don't have to have this base of fire.

1609
01:24:14.68 --> 01:24:19.88
Why don't I take my machine gunners from squad two

1610
01:24:19.88 --> 01:24:21.88
and put them in the base element.

1611
01:24:21.88 --> 01:24:23.88
So then they have massive fire power.

1612
01:24:23.88 --> 01:24:25.88
And plus that means the assault element's a little bit lighter.

1613
01:24:25.88 --> 01:24:27.08
They can move a little bit quicker.

1614
01:24:27.08 --> 01:24:28.08
And we're good.

1615
01:24:29.28 --> 01:24:31.88
And I remember sitting in a platoon brief

1616
01:24:31.88 --> 01:24:33.28
and we were going to do that.

1617
01:24:33.28 --> 01:24:35.88
And wasn't my plan. I was like a new guy.

1618
01:24:35.88 --> 01:24:36.88
Literally a new guy.

1619
01:24:36.88 --> 01:24:38.28
I was just sitting there going,

1620
01:24:38.28 --> 01:24:39.68
okay, tell me what to do.

1621
01:24:40.88 --> 01:24:42.68
And the plan got briefed.

1622
01:24:42.68 --> 01:24:45.28
Hey, okay, this is how we're going to task organized

1623
01:24:45.28 --> 01:24:46.08
for this assault.

1624
01:24:46.08 --> 01:24:48.28
We're going to put all the machine gunners.

1625
01:24:48.28 --> 01:24:51.48
So four machine gunners in the base element.

1626
01:24:51.48 --> 01:24:53.28
And so we're going to have this massive fire power.

1627
01:24:53.28 --> 01:24:57.28
And then these other guys, the point man from the squad one

1628
01:24:57.28 --> 01:24:59.28
and the rear security from squad one

1629
01:24:59.28 --> 01:25:00.68
and whatever one of the corpsmen from squad

1630
01:25:00.68 --> 01:25:03.08
they're going to go down and they're going to go through the assault element.

1631
01:25:03.08 --> 01:25:07.08
And so then the old master chief says,

1632
01:25:07.08 --> 01:25:11.48
well, what if what if the assault element gets compromised?

1633
01:25:11.48 --> 01:25:13.68
They got no machine guns.

1634
01:25:13.68 --> 01:25:18.08
What if the base element wants the assault element gets compromised

1635
01:25:18.08 --> 01:25:20.08
and starts to engage the target?

1636
01:25:20.08 --> 01:25:23.08
What happens if now they have to go on the assault?

1637
01:25:23.08 --> 01:25:27.68
And now the base of fire is weak from the former assault element.

1638
01:25:27.68 --> 01:25:29.08
So what did that tell me?

1639
01:25:29.08 --> 01:25:31.88
I remember sitting there thinking, okay, you got to be.

1640
01:25:31.88 --> 01:25:33.48
That's a contingency.

1641
01:25:33.48 --> 01:25:36.68
And what you're really doing is you're you're you're you're

1642
01:25:36.68 --> 01:25:40.68
you're giving away so much tactical advantage because not only that,

1643
01:25:40.68 --> 01:25:44.28
a seal puttune squad is meant to work a certain way.

1644
01:25:44.28 --> 01:25:46.08
There's a reason it's designed that way.

1645
01:25:46.08 --> 01:25:47.28
And all of a sudden you mix it all up.

1646
01:25:47.28 --> 01:25:49.28
And now you're now with not really a seal squad anymore.

1647
01:25:49.28 --> 01:25:52.48
They're no freaking machine gunners in it.

1648
01:25:52.48 --> 01:25:56.88
What's a seal freaking squad without machine gunners?

1649
01:25:56.88 --> 01:25:59.28
But you've taken those machine gunners away.

1650
01:25:59.28 --> 01:26:04.68
And then you've overly burdened the other one with too many machine gunners.

1651
01:26:04.68 --> 01:26:13.28
So that idea of hey, I'm going to make these adjustments for this particular situation.

1652
01:26:13.28 --> 01:26:17.08
And if everything goes perfect, it's good.

1653
01:26:17.08 --> 01:26:20.88
But if anything changes, it's bad.

1654
01:26:20.88 --> 01:26:23.68
What are the chances things are going to go a little bit different?

1655
01:26:23.68 --> 01:26:26.28
The chances are freaking too high.

1656
01:26:26.28 --> 01:26:28.08
And you don't really gain that much.

1657
01:26:28.08 --> 01:26:31.08
There's not really that much of a advantage anyways.

1658
01:26:31.08 --> 01:26:34.28
So that that reminding me of that.

1659
01:26:34.28 --> 01:26:38.88
Next, have I selected unnecessary intermediate objectives, which distract from the attainment

1660
01:26:38.88 --> 01:26:41.08
of the final objective?

1661
01:26:41.08 --> 01:26:44.28
Intermediate objectives facilitate control and maintain direction.

1662
01:26:44.28 --> 01:26:49.48
However, too many such objectives destroy flexibility and initiative and tend to slow up

1663
01:26:49.48 --> 01:26:50.48
the attack.

1664
01:26:50.48 --> 01:26:53.48
Man.

1665
01:26:53.48 --> 01:26:54.48
Man, that's good.

1666
01:26:54.48 --> 01:26:55.48
You know what's good about that?

1667
01:26:55.48 --> 01:26:57.88
I like that because it's contrary to what we all

1668
01:26:57.88 --> 01:26:58.88
say.

1669
01:26:58.88 --> 01:27:02.48
I say, and I'm saying, we not, I'm not just talking about Esslope front.

1670
01:27:02.48 --> 01:27:03.48
You know, people hate what?

1671
01:27:03.48 --> 01:27:04.48
And it makes sense.

1672
01:27:04.48 --> 01:27:05.48
We know it makes sense.

1673
01:27:05.48 --> 01:27:06.88
Hey, we got this big project to do.

1674
01:27:06.88 --> 01:27:10.28
Okay, let's figure out some intermediate steps that we have some short term goals.

1675
01:27:10.28 --> 01:27:11.28
And we can move in that direction.

1676
01:27:11.28 --> 01:27:12.28
And it feels good.

1677
01:27:12.28 --> 01:27:13.28
We get gratification.

1678
01:27:13.28 --> 01:27:15.48
We make sure we're on track.

1679
01:27:15.48 --> 01:27:16.48
There's a big copy.

1680
01:27:16.48 --> 01:27:17.48
Can we go too far with that?

1681
01:27:17.48 --> 01:27:20.28
Yes, we absolutely can.

1682
01:27:20.28 --> 01:27:23.48
Now all of a sudden, we've got goals that we're trying to achieve or doing reports on goals that

1683
01:27:23.48 --> 01:27:25.48
don't even freaking matter.

1684
01:27:25.48 --> 01:27:27.48
Don't let that happen.

1685
01:27:27.48 --> 01:27:31.68
Have I determined the time and space factors of attacking units from the light into

1686
01:27:31.68 --> 01:27:34.24
departure back to the assembly area?

1687
01:27:34.24 --> 01:27:36.20
Have I set the stage for the assault?

1688
01:27:36.20 --> 01:27:40.04
Have I set the light limited or the light into departure too far back?

1689
01:27:40.04 --> 01:27:45.36
Have I used my forward air control or supporting artillery commander, supporting battery,

1690
01:27:45.36 --> 01:27:49.80
mortar commander, engineer, put two meter, communications officer, assault, assault, gun

1691
01:27:49.80 --> 01:27:54.80
put two meter, reconnaissance put two meter surgeon and my planning.

1692
01:27:54.80 --> 01:27:58.32
And my staff in planning, checking and completing the detailed plans.

1693
01:27:58.32 --> 01:28:02.72
And I'm kind of breezing through, but that one right there, I'm going to pause.

1694
01:28:02.72 --> 01:28:07.36
So he names off all these different people, all these different professionals.

1695
01:28:07.36 --> 01:28:13.96
And then he says, have I used them in planning, checking and completing the details of my

1696
01:28:13.96 --> 01:28:16.36
plans?

1697
01:28:16.36 --> 01:28:19.08
And the reason I want to focus on that, because a bunch of times he talks about, hey, I got

1698
01:28:19.08 --> 01:28:21.44
to give my plan to have I give my plan clearly.

1699
01:28:21.44 --> 01:28:24.72
And what he's saying here is it's not my plan.

1700
01:28:24.72 --> 01:28:29.36
It's the plan of the artillery guy, the mortar guy, the engineer guy, the communications

1701
01:28:29.36 --> 01:28:37.44
guy, the assault guy, the reconnaissance guy, the surgeon, and my staff, it's their plan.

1702
01:28:37.44 --> 01:28:41.48
Have I used them to come up with this plan?

1703
01:28:41.48 --> 01:28:45.44
And if I haven't, then I'm wrong.

1704
01:28:45.44 --> 01:28:49.52
Have I considered the ammunition available to my fire support units?

1705
01:28:49.52 --> 01:28:52.92
Are my supporting fires plans that there will be no laws during critical phase of the attack?

1706
01:28:52.92 --> 01:28:58.60
Have I given consideration the use of nuclear fires?

1707
01:28:58.60 --> 01:29:02.88
To time fire over my tanks, if the tanks are available to smoke, to having my infantry

1708
01:29:02.88 --> 01:29:06.64
follow closely as supporting fires does my plan require holding up any elements during the

1709
01:29:06.64 --> 01:29:09.48
attack to clear barriers or obstacles?

1710
01:29:09.48 --> 01:29:15.60
Does my plan of attack for sea and provide for the next step in case of success, partial

1711
01:29:15.60 --> 01:29:20.44
success, or failure?

1712
01:29:20.44 --> 01:29:24.000
Is this planning?

1713
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.88
But think about that.

1714
01:29:25.88 --> 01:29:28.32
Do I have a plan for success?

1715
01:29:28.32 --> 01:29:29.68
Partial success or failure?

1716
01:29:29.68 --> 01:29:31.16
Do I know what I'm going to do?

1717
01:29:31.16 --> 01:29:38.16
Have I given some unit the mission of watching and securing my flanks?

1718
01:29:38.16 --> 01:29:43.12
Have I ensured that after the seizure of the objective, my units have a detailed plan for

1719
01:29:43.12 --> 01:29:47.56
consolidation, reorganization, and continuing the attacks that they will not rest on their

1720
01:29:47.56 --> 01:29:52.92
goals thus exposing themselves to a surprise counter attack and losses from enemy fires or

1721
01:29:52.92 --> 01:29:58.12
the loss of the initiative?

1722
01:29:58.12 --> 01:30:03.80
Just imagine sitting down with your leadership as you assess something that you're going

1723
01:30:03.80 --> 01:30:10.44
to do and trying to come up with this many holes to punch in your own plan.

1724
01:30:10.44 --> 01:30:18.80
If you're not doing this, the holes don't get filled in.

1725
01:30:18.80 --> 01:30:25.36
Having next phases of the attack order, having war game the plan in his mind and being

1726
01:30:25.36 --> 01:30:27.36
satisfied as to his condition.

1727
01:30:27.36 --> 01:30:30.36
I know I'll say this, it's not in his mind as far as I'm concerned.

1728
01:30:30.36 --> 01:30:31.36
I'm getting the staff together.

1729
01:30:31.36 --> 01:30:32.36
We're going to sit there.

1730
01:30:32.36 --> 01:30:34.12
I'm going to have everyone beat this plan up.

1731
01:30:34.12 --> 01:30:35.12
We're going to go through these questions.

1732
01:30:35.12 --> 01:30:37.48
We're going to come up with more questions.

1733
01:30:37.48 --> 01:30:41.64
Having worked game the plan in his mind and being satisfied as to his solution to commander

1734
01:30:41.64 --> 01:30:45.68
then proceeds to the actual issuing of his order, it can be assumed that some time during

1735
01:30:45.68 --> 01:30:48.96
the foregoing phases he has in addition considered the following.

1736
01:30:48.96 --> 01:30:51.56
He's not even done considering yet.

1737
01:30:51.56 --> 01:30:58.56
I must not take so much time in making my plans and announcing my orders that my subordinate

1738
01:30:58.56 --> 01:31:01.000
have inadequate time before each hour.

1739
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.68
In case of doubt, I will send a staff officer forward to a subordinate commander rather

1740
01:31:04.68 --> 01:31:09.32
than calling him back or hold my conference for issuing orders well for it.

1741
01:31:09.32 --> 01:31:10.32
What does that mean?

1742
01:31:10.32 --> 01:31:12.60
We're taking care of the frontline commander.

1743
01:31:12.60 --> 01:31:16.72
Dude, hey, Dave, I know you're preparing for this right now, but I want you to come

1744
01:31:16.72 --> 01:31:18.92
back to my location so I can brief you.

1745
01:31:18.92 --> 01:31:21.96
No, I'll send a guy out to get you.

1746
01:31:21.96 --> 01:31:25.36
Make sure you know what you need to know.

1747
01:31:25.36 --> 01:31:31.80
In order to avoid misunderstandings and overlooking and important things, I must issue my orders

1748
01:31:31.80 --> 01:31:33.68
in the standard sequence.

1749
01:31:33.68 --> 01:31:39.60
I must make sure that every commander knows what he is to do and win.

1750
01:31:39.60 --> 01:31:47.04
I must impress all with the need for vigorous execution of my plans.

1751
01:31:47.04 --> 01:31:54.36
If the answers to all these are satisfactory, you and your units are off to a good start.

1752
01:31:54.36 --> 01:31:57.04
Dude, what?

1753
01:31:57.04 --> 01:31:58.40
What do you like about that?

1754
01:31:58.40 --> 01:32:00.08
If you do all these things.

1755
01:32:00.08 --> 01:32:01.08
Yeah.

1756
01:32:01.08 --> 01:32:03.12
All these things.

1757
01:32:03.12 --> 01:32:04.12
You're off to a good start.

1758
01:32:04.12 --> 01:32:05.12
You're off to a good start.

1759
01:32:05.12 --> 01:32:08.04
You made the first step in the right direction.

1760
01:32:08.04 --> 01:32:13.48
Do not later second guess your decisions and change your orders.

1761
01:32:13.48 --> 01:32:20.72
Now this is one to talk about at least a little bit.

1762
01:32:20.72 --> 01:32:22.64
Are there times when you need to change your orders?

1763
01:32:22.64 --> 01:32:23.64
Absolutely.

1764
01:32:23.64 --> 01:32:27.44
Are there times when new intelligence comes to light and you say to yourself, you know what?

1765
01:32:27.44 --> 01:32:30.28
The plan that I came up with is no longer optimal.

1766
01:32:30.28 --> 01:32:31.72
I need to change it.

1767
01:32:31.72 --> 01:32:32.72
Is that happened?

1768
01:32:32.72 --> 01:32:35.88
Yes.

1769
01:32:35.88 --> 01:32:43.12
Are there times where you, you, some micro change occurs on the battlefield and you decide

1770
01:32:43.12 --> 01:32:50.68
to change plans that's already been rehearsed, fought through and everyone's been briefed.

1771
01:32:50.68 --> 01:32:53.72
And now you're going to throw a curve ball in everybody.

1772
01:32:53.72 --> 01:32:59.56
I can almost guarantee you that you should just, as we used to say in the teams, plan

1773
01:32:59.56 --> 01:33:01.68
your dive and then dive your plan.

1774
01:33:01.68 --> 01:33:05.64
Then you're diving dive so you come up with a plan and then go and execute your plan.

1775
01:33:05.64 --> 01:33:11.32
When you start throwing curve balls and trying to change things on the fly, is actually

1776
01:33:11.32 --> 01:33:14.72
evident, evident, hayford from Black Rifle Coffee.

1777
01:33:14.72 --> 01:33:20.68
I was out doing some archery with him and we were talking about something he goes, yeah,

1778
01:33:20.68 --> 01:33:22.32
yeah, we'll just figure it out under water.

1779
01:33:22.32 --> 01:33:26.000
Which is, which is actually hilarious thing because when you're diving, obviously you can't

1780
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.36
talk, you can't figure anything out under water.

1781
01:33:28.36 --> 01:33:32.80
And surprisingly, I'd never heard that expression before, but it's freaking awesome.

1782
01:33:32.80 --> 01:33:33.80
It's freaking awesome.

1783
01:33:33.80 --> 01:33:35.36
Hey, we'll just figure it out under water.

1784
01:33:35.36 --> 01:33:39.40
Meaning if we let this go, we are screwed.

1785
01:33:39.40 --> 01:33:40.40
We're screwed.

1786
01:33:40.40 --> 01:33:42.24
So you don't want to figure things out under water.

1787
01:33:42.24 --> 01:33:44.44
What you do is you dive your plan.

1788
01:33:44.44 --> 01:33:48.68
This is such a, this is why leadership is hard because there are absolutely times where

1789
01:33:48.68 --> 01:33:50.28
you go, you know what, bad plan.

1790
01:33:50.28 --> 01:33:52.88
We need to change, we need to change it right now.

1791
01:33:52.88 --> 01:33:55.60
We need to change the plan right now.

1792
01:33:55.60 --> 01:33:57.08
That's fine.

1793
01:33:57.08 --> 01:34:00.80
There's also times where you say, you know what, we're close.

1794
01:34:00.80 --> 01:34:08.20
And what we will gain from trying to adjust this plan right now will be the adjustments.

1795
01:34:08.20 --> 01:34:12.84
We'll be so hard to make it this juncture that it's going to counter any positives that

1796
01:34:12.84 --> 01:34:16.76
will come from trying to change these plan right now.

1797
01:34:16.76 --> 01:34:20.20
So you have to be careful of that.

1798
01:34:20.20 --> 01:34:24.000
Don't harass the subordinate commanders while they are planning.

1799
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.64
Make sure you're there orders and getting ready to carry out their assignments.

1800
01:34:28.64 --> 01:34:32.32
You and your staff should make such checks as are needed without violating this.

1801
01:34:32.32 --> 01:34:36.60
So other of the frontline troops, once the attack starts, you can influence the battle

1802
01:34:36.60 --> 01:34:39.92
by shifting of supporting fires maneuver and use of your reserves.

1803
01:34:39.92 --> 01:34:41.52
You should be prepared to do this.

1804
01:34:41.52 --> 01:34:47.72
You should now anticipate what may happen so that you will be at the critical spot at the

1805
01:34:47.72 --> 01:34:57.44
critical time to give that command push necessary to keep the attack going.

1806
01:34:57.44 --> 01:35:03.16
Commanders should make planning the attack a subject for schools and table exercises

1807
01:35:03.16 --> 01:35:07.40
and tactical walks or rides for the appropriate officers.

1808
01:35:07.40 --> 01:35:11.40
And man, I know you didn't get a chance to do EF battlefield, which we went out to get

1809
01:35:11.40 --> 01:35:12.40
his bird.

1810
01:35:12.40 --> 01:35:16.04
But that tactical walk that we tend to just, it's freaking awesome.

1811
01:35:16.04 --> 01:35:19.04
It's awesome.

1812
01:35:19.04 --> 01:35:25.84
Walking the battlefield and understanding the terrain and seeing it on the ground is absolutely

1813
01:35:25.84 --> 01:35:26.84
phenomenal.

1814
01:35:26.84 --> 01:35:27.84
Lessons learned are incredible.

1815
01:35:27.84 --> 01:35:30.92
I'm going to have Jason and Steve on.

1816
01:35:30.92 --> 01:35:34.24
We're going to talk about that.

1817
01:35:34.24 --> 01:35:41.68
And this is really the last piece and we'll hold off for one more episode.

1818
01:35:41.68 --> 01:35:51.80
One more one more episode for me to fulfill my own personal satisfaction in this book.

1819
01:35:51.80 --> 01:35:57.28
A commander who prepares a checklist from these guidelines will have a great aid in time

1820
01:35:57.28 --> 01:35:58.28
of pressure.

1821
01:35:58.28 --> 01:36:06.44
He will enable him to plan thoroughly with speed instead of haste.

1822
01:36:06.44 --> 01:36:14.20
So speed instead of haste.

1823
01:36:14.20 --> 01:36:16.60
Do essential things first.

1824
01:36:16.60 --> 01:36:19.20
Do things right the first time.

1825
01:36:19.20 --> 01:36:25.000
Practice more than one thing at a time.

1826
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.24
So many just quotes to think about.

1827
01:36:29.24 --> 01:36:33.000
I think one of the first quotes I sent you in a little picture.

1828
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000
The attack is the key to success.

1829
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.56
The defense is merely a temporary expedient to conserve forces for an attack elsewhere, or to

1830
01:36:42.56 --> 01:36:48.12
prepare for an attack at a future date.

1831
01:36:48.12 --> 01:36:49.20
So many good quotes.

1832
01:36:49.20 --> 01:36:58.84
And look, I'm not saying that you should blindly follow the thoughts and ideas in this

1833
01:36:58.84 --> 01:36:59.84
book.

1834
01:36:59.84 --> 01:37:01.72
And I would never say it.

1835
01:37:01.72 --> 01:37:06.52
And we've gone back and forth and we've come to that areas where we disagree with what

1836
01:37:06.52 --> 01:37:08.000
the general has to say.

1837
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.80
But I'll tell you what, add a minimum.

1838
01:37:09.80 --> 01:37:13.12
You should consider them.

1839
01:37:13.12 --> 01:37:14.84
You should consider.

1840
01:37:14.84 --> 01:37:19.28
They could consider those thoughts.

1841
01:37:19.28 --> 01:37:21.16
You should understand where they came from.

1842
01:37:21.16 --> 01:37:23.48
You should understand what they meant.

1843
01:37:23.48 --> 01:37:24.48
You should.

1844
01:37:24.48 --> 01:37:31.40
I should keep them in front of mind because these are lessons that were written and blood.

1845
01:37:31.40 --> 01:37:36.48
And they were proved on the battlefield.

1846
01:37:36.48 --> 01:37:40.40
And they were meant as the book states, and you know what I'm saying here saying, hey,

1847
01:37:40.40 --> 01:37:43.84
don't you don't follow blindly, guess what the book is called?

1848
01:37:43.84 --> 01:37:46.40
The book is called guidelines.

1849
01:37:46.40 --> 01:37:49.28
It's called guidelines.

1850
01:37:49.28 --> 01:37:51.84
Guidelines are supposed to steer us.

1851
01:37:51.84 --> 01:37:55.32
They're supposed to get us going in the right direction.

1852
01:37:55.32 --> 01:37:58.80
They're not supposed to be followed blindly.

1853
01:37:58.80 --> 01:38:04.04
They're not supposed to be obeyed with no deviation whatsoever.

1854
01:38:04.04 --> 01:38:06.84
They're supposed to steer us.

1855
01:38:06.84 --> 01:38:16.80
They're supposed to steer the people that we lead in the right direction.

1856
01:38:16.80 --> 01:38:20.44
What do you think, Dave?

1857
01:38:20.44 --> 01:38:21.44
It's kind of crazy, right?

1858
01:38:21.44 --> 01:38:22.44
It's crazy.

1859
01:38:22.44 --> 01:38:24.84
That I'm scribbling.

1860
01:38:24.84 --> 01:38:26.36
I'm writing notes on this.

1861
01:38:26.36 --> 01:38:35.60
I'm thinking about, I'm just thinking about, almost trying to put myself in general

1862
01:38:35.60 --> 01:38:39.40
clerks shoes, as if I could do that.

1863
01:38:39.40 --> 01:38:46.08
That's page after page, after page of what appears to be all this kind of a new shovel.

1864
01:38:46.08 --> 01:38:49.56
These little details he's bringing out.

1865
01:38:49.56 --> 01:38:50.72
But they're all things.

1866
01:38:50.72 --> 01:38:56.32
Just like you just said, these are all things that he is probably seen over and over again.

1867
01:38:56.32 --> 01:39:01.08
See the reason why teams don't succeed.

1868
01:39:01.08 --> 01:39:05.56
I was trying to summarize what he was saying in my mind is, how much of your plan, how

1869
01:39:05.56 --> 01:39:08.48
much of this thing that you've created, you build the strategy.

1870
01:39:08.48 --> 01:39:10.28
This is what we're going to do.

1871
01:39:10.28 --> 01:39:11.76
Then you build a plan.

1872
01:39:11.76 --> 01:39:15.96
How much of that plan, as you go through these other phases, to test it and pressure,

1873
01:39:15.96 --> 01:39:22.16
test it and consider the errors in it, how much of that is really based in reality?

1874
01:39:22.16 --> 01:39:24.56
How much of is based in truth?

1875
01:39:24.56 --> 01:39:26.12
How much is this what you're contributing?

1876
01:39:26.12 --> 01:39:28.60
Your own brain thinking, this is all going to work out.

1877
01:39:28.60 --> 01:39:30.08
My idea is brilliant.

1878
01:39:30.08 --> 01:39:31.12
I know what's going to happen.

1879
01:39:31.12 --> 01:39:32.88
I put it all together in my head.

1880
01:39:32.88 --> 01:39:37.52
This is how I was going to play out this perfect scenario that I create.

1881
01:39:37.52 --> 01:39:40.68
He's basically saying, don't do that.

1882
01:39:40.68 --> 01:39:47.36
Bring in all these other people to annihilate and poke holes and dig and pick and pull

1883
01:39:47.36 --> 01:39:49.56
every possible error and omission.

1884
01:39:49.56 --> 01:39:57.28
All of the things you haven't done in your plan and in the same breath he's saying,

1885
01:39:57.28 --> 01:40:00.12
and oh, by the way, we're going to stick to the plan.

1886
01:40:00.12 --> 01:40:03.88
The reason we're going to stick to the plan is because actually it's not my plan anymore.

1887
01:40:03.88 --> 01:40:07.24
It hasn't been my plan for a long time because always people came in and understand what

1888
01:40:07.24 --> 01:40:12.88
we're trying to do, pick to the part and they're the ones are going to go execute.

1889
01:40:12.88 --> 01:40:15.56
You talked about humility before.

1890
01:40:15.56 --> 01:40:21.80
The humility of a leader to say, I built the strategy, but the plan, you know why you

1891
01:40:21.80 --> 01:40:25.60
guys are all here to figure out everything wrong with it.

1892
01:40:25.60 --> 01:40:28.80
So you can go execute when the scenario completely falls apart because there's no way I can

1893
01:40:28.80 --> 01:40:31.56
predict what's going to happen.

1894
01:40:31.56 --> 01:40:34.92
I mean, that is crazy.

1895
01:40:34.92 --> 01:40:40.56
The application to that in life is, especially since this is a guideline.

1896
01:40:40.56 --> 01:40:43.80
It is universal because that's what you need to do.

1897
01:40:43.80 --> 01:40:46.68
I don't know the tactic, I don't know how the things are going to play out.

1898
01:40:46.68 --> 01:40:48.84
I don't.

1899
01:40:48.84 --> 01:40:54.28
But hearing what he's saying and the risk of creating it in your own mind and saying, this

1900
01:40:54.28 --> 01:40:58.48
is what's going to go happen, go execute and setting your team up to fail for not being

1901
01:40:58.48 --> 01:41:02.000
prepared for the thousands of contingencies that are absolutely going to happen with your

1902
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.88
plan.

1903
01:41:03.88 --> 01:41:07.88
That finish was, and I know it's not the finish of the whole thing, but that finish was crazy.

1904
01:41:07.88 --> 01:41:09.24
And then he likes to, he concludes with it.

1905
01:41:09.24 --> 01:41:12.32
Oh, by the way, if you do all these things, you're after good start.

1906
01:41:12.32 --> 01:41:13.32
You're off to a good start.

1907
01:41:13.32 --> 01:41:14.32
Oh, that's that's man.

1908
01:41:14.32 --> 01:41:19.04
I think I talked about it in the EF online.

1909
01:41:19.04 --> 01:41:25.80
I think I might have even talked about the debrief podcast of planning with a negative attitude.

1910
01:41:25.80 --> 01:41:29.92
Like, when you're coming up with a plan, you should be looking at that thing as a total

1911
01:41:29.92 --> 01:41:31.32
pessimist.

1912
01:41:31.32 --> 01:41:32.32
This isn't going to work.

1913
01:41:32.32 --> 01:41:33.32
We're not going to have enough people.

1914
01:41:33.32 --> 01:41:34.92
The enemy is going to be there.

1915
01:41:34.92 --> 01:41:36.88
That's how you want to plan.

1916
01:41:36.88 --> 01:41:40.12
And then the other thing you got to be careful of, you know, you just said thousands

1917
01:41:40.12 --> 01:41:41.32
of contingencies.

1918
01:41:41.32 --> 01:41:45.96
And there are thousands of contingencies.

1919
01:41:45.96 --> 01:41:50.36
And there's no possible way you can plan for thousands of contingencies.

1920
01:41:50.36 --> 01:41:55.40
What you can do is you can have decentralized command.

1921
01:41:55.40 --> 01:41:57.32
You can have a plan that's adaptable.

1922
01:41:57.32 --> 01:42:02.36
You can give people the freedom to maneuver, to adapt to those contingencies, which are

1923
01:42:02.36 --> 01:42:05.20
unforeseen.

1924
01:42:05.20 --> 01:42:08.20
As long as they understand why they're doing what they're doing and they understand what

1925
01:42:08.20 --> 01:42:13.24
the intent of the operation is, they can make a thousand decisions that never even talk

1926
01:42:13.24 --> 01:42:14.24
to you.

1927
01:42:14.24 --> 01:42:17.04
Never talk to you one time.

1928
01:42:17.04 --> 01:42:18.64
That's the goal.

1929
01:42:18.64 --> 01:42:20.88
The plan has to be flexible enough.

1930
01:42:20.88 --> 01:42:26.28
The command needs to be decentralized down to the lowest possible level.

1931
01:42:26.28 --> 01:42:29.68
And as long as everybody understands what it is that we're trying to accomplish, they

1932
01:42:29.68 --> 01:42:31.80
understand why they're doing what they're doing.

1933
01:42:31.80 --> 01:42:34.84
They understand the intent of the operation.

1934
01:42:34.84 --> 01:42:44.40
They can make a thousand decisions by themselves and get the mission done.

1935
01:42:44.40 --> 01:42:47.96
That is a powerful thing to think about.

1936
01:42:47.96 --> 01:42:52.64
So like I said, I think we got one more podcast with this book and it will be done and

1937
01:42:52.64 --> 01:42:54.76
we'll get it out there to the world.

1938
01:42:54.76 --> 01:42:59.08
We'll get some some version of it out there to the troops.

1939
01:42:59.08 --> 01:43:02.84
And that way we can use this book to guide us.

1940
01:43:02.84 --> 01:43:07.68
We'll steer us in the right direction.

1941
01:43:07.68 --> 01:43:17.84
So echo Charles, speaking of steering us and guiding us in the right direction.

1942
01:43:17.84 --> 01:43:19.48
Maybe we're not right direction.

1943
01:43:19.48 --> 01:43:20.48
Maybe we're not right direction.

1944
01:43:20.48 --> 01:43:22.92
We're not going to, when we need that remote.

1945
01:43:22.92 --> 01:43:25.76
We're going to get up and we're going to do the right thing.

1946
01:43:25.76 --> 01:43:27.36
We're going to get the sweat full.

1947
01:43:27.36 --> 01:43:28.36
Yes.

1948
01:43:28.36 --> 01:43:29.84
Solution or the solution with some sweat.

1949
01:43:29.84 --> 01:43:30.84
We'll say.

1950
01:43:30.84 --> 01:43:31.84
Yeah.

1951
01:43:31.84 --> 01:43:32.84
Either way.

1952
01:43:32.84 --> 01:43:33.84
Yes.

1953
01:43:33.84 --> 01:43:34.84
So a path.

1954
01:43:34.84 --> 01:43:35.84
Really?

1955
01:43:35.84 --> 01:43:36.84
Direction.

1956
01:43:36.84 --> 01:43:37.84
The path.

1957
01:43:37.84 --> 01:43:38.84
Yes.

1958
01:43:38.84 --> 01:43:39.84
She's actually.

1959
01:43:39.84 --> 01:43:41.84
I'm not all that right now.

1960
01:43:41.84 --> 01:43:43.84
But I'm going to set up.

1961
01:43:43.84 --> 01:43:44.84
Okay.

1962
01:43:44.84 --> 01:43:45.84
Yes.

1963
01:43:45.84 --> 01:43:47.84
We're all on this path.

1964
01:43:47.84 --> 01:43:54.84
And wise men once said path is not easy.

1965
01:43:54.84 --> 01:43:57.84
The path is hard.

1966
01:43:57.84 --> 01:43:58.84
Anyway.

1967
01:43:58.84 --> 01:44:02.84
Okay. So on this path, we do need supplementation.

1968
01:44:02.84 --> 01:44:03.84
Okay.

1969
01:44:03.84 --> 01:44:04.84
And supplementation.

1970
01:44:04.84 --> 01:44:10.36
And kind of you kind of forget about this where you know how like you probably will never

1971
01:44:10.36 --> 01:44:11.36
have this problem.

1972
01:44:11.36 --> 01:44:12.36
Maybe you do maybe not at all.

1973
01:44:12.36 --> 01:44:13.36
But they broke maybe.

1974
01:44:13.36 --> 01:44:15.16
So you know how like you're really used to taking.

1975
01:44:15.16 --> 01:44:16.16
Okay.

1976
01:44:16.16 --> 01:44:19.44
So I'm really used to taking discipline right before work comes.

1977
01:44:19.44 --> 01:44:23.36
And if I start running low or run out panic.

1978
01:44:23.36 --> 01:44:24.36
Yeah.

1979
01:44:24.36 --> 01:44:28.08
Like, well, for lack of a better term, we'll say, yeah.

1980
01:44:28.08 --> 01:44:32.08
But it's the kind like, right, if I run out, I don't know if I can work out.

1981
01:44:32.08 --> 01:44:36.60
Of course, I'm not thinking that specifically, but that's the feeling I get, you know.

1982
01:44:36.60 --> 01:44:39.24
But then I got to remind myself, no, no, this is all supplementation.

1983
01:44:39.24 --> 01:44:40.60
It's help on this path.

1984
01:44:40.60 --> 01:44:41.76
That's what all this stuff is.

1985
01:44:41.76 --> 01:44:43.08
So just keep that in mind.

1986
01:44:43.08 --> 01:44:44.08
Okay.

1987
01:44:44.08 --> 01:44:45.08
All right.

1988
01:44:45.08 --> 01:44:52.40
So anyway, with that and the reason I thought about that also another reason was this path is hard.

1989
01:44:52.40 --> 01:44:53.40
Right.

1990
01:44:53.40 --> 01:44:54.40
And like I just said, okay.

1991
01:44:54.40 --> 01:44:56.84
So the other day, my wife got injured.

1992
01:44:56.84 --> 01:44:57.84
Right.

1993
01:44:57.84 --> 01:44:58.84
So I'm not sure if I can do it.

1994
01:44:58.84 --> 01:44:59.84
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1995
01:44:59.84 --> 01:45:04.84
I'm not sure, but I'm saying, I just, I don't want people worried about you.

1996
01:45:04.84 --> 01:45:05.84
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1997
01:45:05.84 --> 01:45:06.84
Correct.

1998
01:45:06.84 --> 01:45:07.84
Yeah.

1999
01:45:07.84 --> 01:45:07.84
Yeah.

2000
01:45:07.84 --> 01:45:12.16
Some fractures on the feet, you know, whatever, you know, I had to slide in injuries that are not

2001
01:45:12.16 --> 01:45:13.96
life changing in any negative way.

2002
01:45:13.96 --> 01:45:15.96
For a very comfortable area.

2003
01:45:15.96 --> 01:45:17.96
In convenience.

2004
01:45:17.96 --> 01:45:20.16
But we're pushing through it.

2005
01:45:20.16 --> 01:45:21.16
We're going to recover.

2006
01:45:21.16 --> 01:45:23.84
We're going to shift some, some resources, right?

2007
01:45:23.84 --> 01:45:25.84
Some sliding into various roles.

2008
01:45:25.84 --> 01:45:26.84
Right.

2009
01:45:26.84 --> 01:45:31.16
One of them is required a little bit earlier of a morning for me a lot earlier.

2010
01:45:31.16 --> 01:45:32.16
Right.

2011
01:45:32.16 --> 01:45:33.16
Right.

2012
01:45:33.16 --> 01:45:34.16
Right.

2013
01:45:34.16 --> 01:45:37.16
We were not going to go into those details, you know.

2014
01:45:37.16 --> 01:45:42.84
But I wound out with, if I'm not mistaken, two hours of sleep, a little bit more than two

2015
01:45:42.84 --> 01:45:43.84
hours.

2016
01:45:43.84 --> 01:45:44.84
Like under three hours of sleep.

2017
01:45:44.84 --> 01:45:45.84
Right.

2018
01:45:45.84 --> 01:45:48.76
So of course, you know what that means.

2019
01:45:48.76 --> 01:45:50.40
The workout becomes questionable.

2020
01:45:50.40 --> 01:45:52.40
You see, I'm saying.

2021
01:45:52.40 --> 01:45:54.88
But so I started thinking.

2022
01:45:54.88 --> 01:45:59.60
And it has to do with what we're talking about last time where you kind of think about

2023
01:45:59.60 --> 01:46:03.76
it like, what does it take to get this workout done?

2024
01:46:03.76 --> 01:46:08.56
And my default is, well, obviously a long nap first.

2025
01:46:08.56 --> 01:46:10.72
But let's say that's not available to us.

2026
01:46:10.72 --> 01:46:16.32
When you rather just get it done, well, you know, I'd rather it be done for sure.

2027
01:46:16.32 --> 01:46:21.52
But I don't know about the getting it part, you seem to say, when you're only on two,

2028
01:46:21.52 --> 01:46:22.60
half hours sleep, whatever.

2029
01:46:22.60 --> 01:46:24.68
Anyway, so I'm like, what would it take?

2030
01:46:24.68 --> 01:46:25.68
Okay.

2031
01:46:25.68 --> 01:46:28.48
So what if, and this is just going on, it might might.

2032
01:46:28.48 --> 01:46:33.60
What would it be like, like, what's holding me back from actually just doing it?

2033
01:46:33.60 --> 01:46:38.000
You know, like, what would, is there anything that would keep me from achieving that,

2034
01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.44
you know, getting the workout done, some small, like such a small deal when I'm

2035
01:46:42.44 --> 01:46:43.72
playing it out loud.

2036
01:46:43.72 --> 01:46:44.72
But nonetheless.

2037
01:46:44.72 --> 01:46:49.40
Yeah, I saw a video the other day of Joe Rogan and they had Joe Rogan, somebody

2038
01:46:49.40 --> 01:46:53.28
was talking to him and they just were like, they were showing his face while the person

2039
01:46:53.28 --> 01:46:57.32
was talking, he was thinking about like some other totally random, he wasn't paying attention.

2040
01:46:57.32 --> 01:46:58.92
Is that how you're feeling right off the side?

2041
01:46:58.92 --> 01:46:59.92
So just in that boat.

2042
01:46:59.92 --> 01:47:03.92
I was just like, dude, what are you talking about?

2043
01:47:03.92 --> 01:47:04.92
You're not trust me.

2044
01:47:04.92 --> 01:47:05.92
Trust me.

2045
01:47:05.92 --> 01:47:06.92
That's bringing home.

2046
01:47:06.92 --> 01:47:07.92
It's going to have some of that.

2047
01:47:07.92 --> 01:47:08.92
Bring it home.

2048
01:47:08.92 --> 01:47:10.68
No, I'm telling you this, I have something to tell you.

2049
01:47:10.68 --> 01:47:11.68
Okay.

2050
01:47:11.68 --> 01:47:16.52
So I wind up just concluding that.

2051
01:47:16.52 --> 01:47:19.36
I ended up concluding that, okay.

2052
01:47:19.36 --> 01:47:23.16
Dave's got to look at the scary thing is Dave's face.

2053
01:47:23.16 --> 01:47:24.52
He's going to rock in his face.

2054
01:47:24.52 --> 01:47:27.92
He's really trying to stay with you.

2055
01:47:27.92 --> 01:47:31.52
Yeah, he's staying with me because he knows that he's going to be able to use this.

2056
01:47:31.52 --> 01:47:32.52
Okay.

2057
01:47:32.52 --> 01:47:33.52
Let me get over here.

2058
01:47:33.52 --> 01:47:34.52
All right.

2059
01:47:34.52 --> 01:47:39.76
So anyway, I'm like, okay, technically there's nothing keeping me from getting

2060
01:47:39.76 --> 01:47:43.40
this work up done, even though it seems like a real painful idea right now.

2061
01:47:43.40 --> 01:47:46.60
Is there anything keeping you forgetting this story done?

2062
01:47:46.60 --> 01:47:48.40
The actual content of the story.

2063
01:47:48.40 --> 01:47:51.60
So Barry, you should incorporate this mindset into right now.

2064
01:47:51.60 --> 01:47:52.60
Okay.

2065
01:47:52.60 --> 01:47:54.60
I can finish it if I don't start it.

2066
01:47:54.60 --> 01:47:55.60
Okay.

2067
01:47:55.60 --> 01:48:02.08
Anyway, the answer ended up to be nothing aside from me very much not being in the mood

2068
01:48:02.08 --> 01:48:06.96
to I had convinced myself that I need a certain amount of sleep to get a workout done

2069
01:48:06.96 --> 01:48:07.96
on an individual level.

2070
01:48:07.96 --> 01:48:08.96
It's not true.

2071
01:48:08.96 --> 01:48:09.96
Not true.

2072
01:48:09.96 --> 01:48:13.72
So it's kind of like, okay, it's kind of a form of realizing that you kind of have

2073
01:48:13.72 --> 01:48:15.16
mental toughness in a way.

2074
01:48:15.16 --> 01:48:16.16
Okay.

2075
01:48:16.16 --> 01:48:21.48
Like realizing it, not invoking it, just realizing it and then you can use it.

2076
01:48:21.48 --> 01:48:23.28
So I got the workout done.

2077
01:48:23.28 --> 01:48:24.28
Okay.

2078
01:48:24.28 --> 01:48:25.28
All right.

2079
01:48:25.28 --> 01:48:32.92
What also what that did, what that did also is set the precedent.

2080
01:48:32.92 --> 01:48:33.92
There I was.

2081
01:48:33.92 --> 01:48:36.60
They did it was going nowhere.

2082
01:48:36.60 --> 01:48:38.88
It set the precedent for it.

2083
01:48:38.88 --> 01:48:41.44
If that happens again, you just automatically know.

2084
01:48:41.44 --> 01:48:42.92
You seem saying, okay.

2085
01:48:42.92 --> 01:48:43.92
Rather than trying to deep deep.

2086
01:48:43.92 --> 01:48:44.92
You don't have to dig deep.

2087
01:48:44.92 --> 01:48:47.04
You just gotta realize some stuff sometimes.

2088
01:48:47.04 --> 01:48:48.04
This is what I'm saying.

2089
01:48:48.04 --> 01:48:49.04
Roger.

2090
01:48:49.04 --> 01:48:50.04
Anyway.

2091
01:48:50.04 --> 01:48:53.44
So you can do the supplementation when you're doing these things, whether you're

2092
01:48:53.44 --> 01:48:57.84
out of discipline or not, this is all supplementation.

2093
01:48:57.84 --> 01:49:00.36
You do the workout, you take the supplementation.

2094
01:49:00.36 --> 01:49:02.80
It's like you ever play that game super off-road.

2095
01:49:02.80 --> 01:49:03.80
You play that game?

2096
01:49:03.80 --> 01:49:04.80
No.

2097
01:49:04.80 --> 01:49:05.80
No.

2098
01:49:05.80 --> 01:49:09.40
It's like a game like you race, a truck.

2099
01:49:09.40 --> 01:49:10.84
For real, it makes sense.

2100
01:49:10.84 --> 01:49:16.08
You race in a truck and then if you win, you get credits where you can buy like acceleration

2101
01:49:16.08 --> 01:49:20.72
or speed or traction or whatever.

2102
01:49:20.72 --> 01:49:23.08
That's what every one of these supplements is.

2103
01:49:23.08 --> 01:49:24.08
Okay.

2104
01:49:24.08 --> 01:49:27.40
You seem saying, got the discipline for your mind, for your body, got

2105
01:49:27.40 --> 01:49:30.08
won't for the protein, you know, all these things.

2106
01:49:30.08 --> 01:49:35.08
So if you get them all, like you have the full decked out routine for the path,

2107
01:49:35.08 --> 01:49:36.08
this is what I'm saying.

2108
01:49:36.08 --> 01:49:37.08
So a bunch of things.

2109
01:49:37.08 --> 01:49:38.08
Join warfare.

2110
01:49:38.08 --> 01:49:39.08
Super cruel.

2111
01:49:39.08 --> 01:49:40.08
Discipline.

2112
01:49:40.08 --> 01:49:42.08
Vitamin B.

2113
01:49:42.08 --> 01:49:43.08
Cold War.

2114
01:49:43.08 --> 01:49:44.08
Malk.

2115
01:49:44.08 --> 01:49:49.08
Yeah, but smashing Pumpkin Malk, which has to be just brought up because...

2116
01:49:49.08 --> 01:49:51.08
Yeah, it's good.

2117
01:49:51.08 --> 01:49:55.08
But you gotta include what Malk is, Malk is, though.

2118
01:49:55.08 --> 01:49:56.08
Protein.

2119
01:49:56.08 --> 01:49:58.08
Don't they really know that now?

2120
01:49:58.08 --> 01:49:59.08
Kind of.

2121
01:49:59.08 --> 01:50:00.08
I mean, this is the first lesson.

2122
01:50:00.08 --> 01:50:02.08
You're so realistic.

2123
01:50:02.08 --> 01:50:04.08
They know every time.

2124
01:50:04.08 --> 01:50:06.08
I think you're actually incorrect on that.

2125
01:50:06.08 --> 01:50:09.08
I think that, that your opinion is factually incorrect on that.

2126
01:50:09.08 --> 01:50:11.08
I feel like there was a value there.

2127
01:50:11.08 --> 01:50:12.08
Okay.

2128
01:50:12.08 --> 01:50:17.08
Would there something value there or no?

2129
01:50:17.08 --> 01:50:20.08
Do you think there was some value?

2130
01:50:20.08 --> 01:50:21.08
Yes, I'm...

2131
01:50:21.08 --> 01:50:23.08
I gotta be honest with you.

2132
01:50:23.08 --> 01:50:27.08
I'm kind of over here thinking there's a little bit of a conflict in what you're saying.

2133
01:50:27.08 --> 01:50:28.08
Okay.

2134
01:50:28.08 --> 01:50:32.08
Because what I would think is, if I was on two hours of sleep, man, and like, look, the soon

2135
01:50:32.08 --> 01:50:33.08
I'd get this...

2136
01:50:33.08 --> 01:50:38.08
Soon I get in, the soon I get out, and you're in complete control of that situation.

2137
01:50:38.08 --> 01:50:41.08
And it's kind of the situation we're in right now, I was like, bro, if there's anybody

2138
01:50:41.08 --> 01:50:45.08
at all of getting through the support phase, it's you.

2139
01:50:45.08 --> 01:50:48.08
Bro, you can jam through this.

2140
01:50:48.08 --> 01:50:50.08
Well, much like you did that workout.

2141
01:50:50.08 --> 01:50:56.08
Well, respectfully, I don't think this phase is the part you just jam through as it were.

2142
01:50:56.08 --> 01:50:58.08
You know, this is important information.

2143
01:50:58.08 --> 01:50:59.08
I don't know.

2144
01:50:59.08 --> 01:51:00.08
I think it is.

2145
01:51:00.08 --> 01:51:01.08
Do you think it is?

2146
01:51:01.08 --> 01:51:02.08
Fair enough.

2147
01:51:02.08 --> 01:51:03.08
All right. Well, it's not jam through it.

2148
01:51:03.08 --> 01:51:04.08
I don't know.

2149
01:51:04.08 --> 01:51:05.08
I don't know.

2150
01:51:05.08 --> 01:51:05.08
Cool.

2151
01:51:05.08 --> 01:51:06.08
Can we get through it?

2152
01:51:06.08 --> 01:51:07.08
Thanks, everyone.

2153
01:51:07.08 --> 01:51:08.08
That's about to press stop.

2154
01:51:08.08 --> 01:51:11.08
Thank you for listening.

2155
01:51:11.08 --> 01:51:12.08
Okay.

2156
01:51:12.08 --> 01:51:13.08
All right.

2157
01:51:13.08 --> 01:51:14.08
Thanks for the support.

2158
01:51:14.08 --> 01:51:15.08
Okay.

2159
01:51:15.08 --> 01:51:18.08
Look, Jock, if you want to be invited back onto the podcast, you can

2160
01:51:18.08 --> 01:51:19.08
bear with me.

2161
01:51:19.08 --> 01:51:23.08
Anyway, supplement joint stuff, joint warfare, super-cryl oil.

2162
01:51:23.08 --> 01:51:25.08
This is for you joints.

2163
01:51:25.08 --> 01:51:30.08
Vitamin D3, Cold War Immunity, also other benefits.

2164
01:51:30.08 --> 01:51:35.08
Discipline, discipline, go for your mind, and your body everyday, take down one.

2165
01:51:35.08 --> 01:51:38.08
It'll help you. Trust me. It'll help you.

2166
01:51:38.08 --> 01:51:44.08
Energy drink, discipline, go RTD, energy drink, healthy, legitimately, factually healthy.

2167
01:51:44.08 --> 01:51:52.08
Real energy, real energy, not like am I up for two hours and now we're looking for real energy.

2168
01:51:52.08 --> 01:51:53.08
Clean energy.

2169
01:51:53.08 --> 01:52:01.08
And this sounds kind of odd, but there's no poisonous elements in there.

2170
01:52:01.08 --> 01:52:02.08
Yeah.

2171
01:52:02.08 --> 01:52:07.08
So you need to have to say that until you look at some other energy.

2172
01:52:07.08 --> 01:52:10.08
Things out there that do have places out there.

2173
01:52:10.08 --> 01:52:12.08
That may or may not have places out there.

2174
01:52:12.08 --> 01:52:15.08
Or things that can be considered poisonous.

2175
01:52:15.08 --> 01:52:16.08
Yeah.

2176
01:52:16.08 --> 01:52:19.08
So, you know, there is that. So it's a big deal.

2177
01:52:19.08 --> 01:52:22.08
Boom, continuing on the list, MOC, dessert in the form of a protein.

2178
01:52:22.08 --> 01:52:30.08
All kinds of flavors, including, but not limited to smashing pumpkin, which is inspired by pumpkin spice.

2179
01:52:30.08 --> 01:52:34.08
Yeah. It is fall at the moment. Hey, listen, we just real quick.

2180
01:52:34.08 --> 01:52:41.08
When you talked about maybe some other, let's call them energy drinks broadly.

2181
01:52:41.08 --> 01:52:45.08
Right now we're experiencing some conflict.

2182
01:52:45.08 --> 01:52:54.08
Some people might even say acts of war have been, have transpired in this category.

2183
01:52:54.08 --> 01:52:58.08
So we may need to go, well, we will retow it.

2184
01:52:58.08 --> 01:53:06.08
We are retaliating the best way. If you want to help retaliate, and you happen to at this time, when is it?

2185
01:53:06.08 --> 01:53:14.08
If you're alive right now, if you're, it is November 2020.

2186
01:53:14.08 --> 01:53:19.08
We are rolling, we are in wall wash stores in Florida.

2187
01:53:19.08 --> 01:53:25.08
If you're there, and you want to help win the war that we are engaged in at this time, go to wall

2188
01:53:25.08 --> 01:53:37.08
wall, in Florida, and you get yourself a bunch of jacquadissipling go to help us defeat the enemy.

2189
01:53:37.08 --> 01:53:45.08
Thank you. You can also get a vitamin shop. If you're not in Florida, you can also get it at originmain.com.

2190
01:53:45.08 --> 01:53:49.08
You can also get it. You can get it on Amazon. Straight up.

2191
01:53:49.08 --> 01:53:58.08
Also, forgot to mention, Jacco White Tea, Tea Begs, and Cance, by the way. Again, this is supplementation.

2192
01:53:58.08 --> 01:54:02.08
Right? You're on the path with or without this. Now you got the supplementation.

2193
01:54:02.08 --> 01:54:09.08
You got the full decked out vehicle on the path. Good to go. You do all these things.

2194
01:54:09.08 --> 01:54:16.08
You're off to a good start. Hey, hey, speaking of flavors, by the way, you mentioned smashing pumpkin.

2195
01:54:16.08 --> 01:54:23.08
Yeah. We have another flavor that's been released into the wild. Yeah. Okay. Dave Burke. What's the new flavor?

2196
01:54:23.08 --> 01:54:26.08
Why don't you tell us the discipline go? Yes.

2197
01:54:26.08 --> 01:54:36.08
flavor. Afterburner Orange. And this is Dave Burke's signature flavor indeed it is.

2198
01:54:36.08 --> 01:54:42.08
So, we this came from when you were a child. You liked to drink orange soda of some kind.

2199
01:54:42.08 --> 01:54:47.08
We're not talking about brands. You have replicated that flavor.

2200
01:54:47.08 --> 01:54:54.08
Now is it a little bit because discipline go traditionally is not Serapy sweet. Right?

2201
01:54:54.08 --> 01:55:01.08
It's not sugar. It doesn't have that taste. So, did you is a lighter form of one of these former

2202
01:55:01.08 --> 01:55:06.08
or an orange drinks that you use by design? It's actually supposed to kind of make you remember what it tastes like.

2203
01:55:06.08 --> 01:55:10.08
Well, that is tasting like you're drinking a pile of sugar.

2204
01:55:10.08 --> 01:55:15.08
Cool. And that's exactly what it does. It's a little more refreshing. It is refreshing. It is cleaner.

2205
01:55:15.08 --> 01:55:24.08
But due to it is it is good. So, there you go. If you want to support well, if you want to support afterburner Orange,

2206
01:55:24.08 --> 01:55:28.08
if you want to support Dave Burke. Good deal to yes, that's the one.

2207
01:55:28.08 --> 01:55:32.08
Is it say good deal Dave on the can? It does. This is a good deal.

2208
01:55:32.08 --> 01:55:39.08
Man, you're off to good start. It's cool that anyone can go back in time and witness the creation of the nickname good deal Dave.

2209
01:55:39.08 --> 01:55:44.08
It's pretty, that's kind of cool. Very, very cool. I think it's kind of cool.

2210
01:55:44.08 --> 01:55:46.08
All right. Sorry up. What else?

2211
01:55:46.08 --> 01:55:49.08
Oh, I didn't jam through that man. It was really good. Thank you.

2212
01:55:49.08 --> 01:55:52.08
Yeah. It kind of is my jam. It was one might say.

2213
01:55:52.08 --> 01:55:56.08
All right. Yeah. Additionally, or Jim Maine, you mentioned origin made in dot com.

2214
01:55:56.08 --> 01:56:01.08
You can get this stuff. That's one of the places you can get all this great stuff. Great stuff.

2215
01:56:01.08 --> 01:56:06.08
You can also get jujitsu stuff, guise, rash guards all made in America by the way.

2216
01:56:06.08 --> 01:56:16.08
You know, some hoodies and whatnot. Also American made denim jeans and boots.

2217
01:56:16.08 --> 01:56:21.08
Yeah. For where you might want to check out the Delta 68 jeans.

2218
01:56:21.08 --> 01:56:24.08
Yeah. They are being produced as fast as we can make them right now.

2219
01:56:24.08 --> 01:56:28.08
We had a little, we had a delta to make. There was a gap.

2220
01:56:28.08 --> 01:56:33.08
We had a little stand down during COVID and we're back up and running.

2221
01:56:33.08 --> 01:56:41.08
And there's a little bit of a redesign. And the new version of Delta 68s are just freaking awesome.

2222
01:56:41.08 --> 01:56:46.08
They're awesome. You don't have any yet. Do you? I do. Oh, you do. You got the new ones?

2223
01:56:46.08 --> 01:56:51.08
I got one pair. That's cool. Yes. They're sick. They're awesome.

2224
01:56:51.08 --> 01:56:54.08
All right. So Delta jeans, you can check those out.

2225
01:56:54.08 --> 01:56:57.08
And obviously we're training jujitsu.

2226
01:56:57.08 --> 01:57:01.08
So there's some jujitsu stuff from these guise.

2227
01:57:01.08 --> 01:57:07.08
Brash guards boots, boots, belts. Oh, damn me. And wallet.

2228
01:57:07.08 --> 01:57:13.08
Yeah. Yeah. I saw that. I saw this too. And Brad, I don't look at sea wallets and be like,

2229
01:57:13.08 --> 01:57:17.08
Ooh, cool wallet. You know, you know how you get marketed to, right?

2230
01:57:17.08 --> 01:57:23.08
You know, it's like, oh, check out our new XYZ. I'm not the kind. Well, usually wallets don't like,

2231
01:57:23.08 --> 01:57:28.08
what do you see? They don't, they don't, they don't land. They don't like your fire. They don't like my fire.

2232
01:57:28.08 --> 01:57:33.08
Got it. Exactly right. But the origin wallet is basically kind of lit my fire.

2233
01:57:33.08 --> 01:57:38.08
It's actually not less it's on there. Orgeneme.com. Also,

Also, big deal.

01:58:04.08 --> 01:58:10.08
Yes, kind of an announcement in a way. There's a T shirt club happening.

2240
01:58:10.08 --> 01:58:18.08
You get one shirt every month for a little subscription situation. These aren't actuals with the subscription.

These are situation. Those are not shirts. These are not shirts that you can get on Jocquas store.

01:58:49.08 --> 01:58:56.08
This is the only podcast. By the way, we've got a podcast called Jockel unraveling with myself and Darrell Cooper.

2248
01:58:56.08 --> 01:59:03.08
We got the grounded podcast. We got the Warrior Kid podcast. And I know I know I owe you.

2249
01:59:03.08 --> 01:59:08.08
You saw some warrior kid podcast and some grounded podcast, really.

2250
01:59:08.08 --> 01:59:09.08
Yeah.

Life and I have done a couple. So that's just that's inside the Jockel podcast.

2255
01:59:26.08 --> 01:59:28.08
Feed feed.

2256
01:59:28.08 --> 01:59:29.08
Sure. The feed.

2257
01:59:29.08 --> 01:59:34.08
Mara says feed.

2258
01:59:34.08 --> 01:59:36.08
This podcast.

2259
01:59:36.08 --> 01:59:39.08
Some people like to watch video rather than just audio.

2260
01:59:39.08 --> 01:59:44.08
Maybe more immersive. You know, we got our smart TVs, projectors, whatever the case may be.

2261
01:59:44.08 --> 01:59:48.08
Anyway, we do have a YouTube channel also some excerpts on there.

2262
01:59:48.08 --> 01:59:52.08
If you need these messages in smaller, what do you say, doses?

2263
01:59:52.08 --> 01:59:53.08
Mm.

2264
01:59:53.08 --> 01:59:55.08
Not doses. That's not the correct word.

2265
01:59:55.08 --> 01:59:56.08
It seems to work.

2266
01:59:56.08 --> 02:00:00.08
Smaller.

2267
02:00:00.08 --> 02:00:01.08
Cut up clips. Anyway, some excerpts on there.

2268
02:00:01.08 --> 02:00:03.08
Anyway, this is work better than cut up.

2269
02:00:03.08 --> 02:00:06.08
There you go. Boom. There you go. Those is according to Jockel.

2270
02:00:06.08 --> 02:00:08.08
Anyway, yeah, it's on there. Real easy to find YouTube.

2271
02:00:08.08 --> 02:00:12.08
There it is. Boom. YouTube channel subscribe on that one.

2272
02:00:12.08 --> 02:00:17.08
Also psychological warfare. If you have any moments of weakness, two hours of sleep or otherwise.

2273
02:00:17.08 --> 02:00:20.08
If you just in the mood to skip a workout.

2274
02:00:20.08 --> 02:00:22.08
I got three hours of sleep last night.

2275
02:00:22.08 --> 02:00:25.08
Yeah, but you don't count with this sleep thing.

2276
02:00:25.08 --> 02:00:27.08
I said, I said, what I said.

2277
02:00:27.08 --> 02:00:29.08
You're like, yeah, the end point.

2278
02:00:29.08 --> 02:00:30.08
Here's the end.

2279
02:00:30.08 --> 02:00:32.08
What's in Somni. Here's the end Somni.

2280
02:00:32.08 --> 02:00:35.08
Here's what in Somni is like for me.

2281
02:00:35.08 --> 02:00:37.08
My mind isn't a roller coaster.

2282
02:00:37.08 --> 02:00:40.08
Well, I was a roller coaster, but I'm going down tracks.

2283
02:00:40.08 --> 02:00:44.08
And every, like every thought I have, it's just a right turn left turn.

2284
02:00:44.08 --> 02:00:48.08
And I'm just, I, it's just, my mind is just racing.

2285
02:00:48.08 --> 02:00:48.08
Yeah.

2286
02:00:48.08 --> 02:00:50.08
And I'm going this, thinking that, thinking another thing.

2287
02:00:50.08 --> 02:00:52.08
And there's no possible way I can go to sleep.

2288
02:00:52.08 --> 02:00:54.08
There's no possible way I can go to sleep.

2289
02:00:54.08 --> 02:00:57.08
And so I was up into, around.

2290
02:00:57.08 --> 02:01:00.08
It was like, it was like 1808.

2291
02:01:00.08 --> 02:01:02.08
The last time I looked at the clock.

2292
02:01:02.08 --> 02:01:03.08
Mm.

2293
02:01:03.08 --> 02:01:06.08
And then the alarm clock went off.

2294
02:01:06.08 --> 02:01:08.08
So like you fell asleep.

2295
02:01:08.08 --> 02:01:10.08
Didn't realize you fell asleep in by the time.

2296
02:01:10.08 --> 02:01:14.08
Yeah, so we're just somewhere after 1808.

2297
02:01:14.08 --> 02:01:17.08
I fell asleep.

2298
02:01:17.08 --> 02:01:19.08
And then the alarm clock went off.

2299
02:01:19.08 --> 02:01:20.08
You got to have time.

2300
02:01:20.08 --> 02:01:21.08
You got to have time.

2301
02:01:21.08 --> 02:01:25.08
I'm going to get that.

2302
02:01:25.08 --> 02:01:27.08
I'll get that sometimes that that's actually pretty good description.

2303
02:01:27.08 --> 02:01:29.08
I'll get that sometimes.

2304
02:01:29.08 --> 02:01:31.08
But not before I go to sleep, it'll be like,

2305
02:01:31.08 --> 02:01:33.08
I'll wake up at not quote, I'm quote middle of the night.

2306
02:01:33.08 --> 02:01:35.08
And that'll happen.

2307
02:01:35.08 --> 02:01:37.08
And I can't go back sleep.

2308
02:01:37.08 --> 02:01:40.08
And it gets to the point where I'm like, bro, I just got like 25 more minutes.

2309
02:01:40.08 --> 02:01:42.08
I almost got up.

2310
02:01:42.08 --> 02:01:44.08
I almost got up at midnight and just went to work out.

2311
02:01:44.08 --> 02:01:45.08
I probably should have.

2312
02:01:45.08 --> 02:01:46.08
In fact, I should have.

2313
02:01:46.08 --> 02:01:48.08
But I can't think it's right there.

2314
02:01:48.08 --> 02:01:49.08
Like maybe over the ground.

2315
02:01:49.08 --> 02:01:50.08
Maybe around this next corner is.

2316
02:01:50.08 --> 02:01:51.08
It'll be a little while.

2317
02:01:51.08 --> 02:01:52.08
Maybe it's just there.

2318
02:01:52.08 --> 02:01:53.08
Some waiting for it waiting for it.

2319
02:01:53.08 --> 02:01:56.08
And the longer you're trying to wait for it, the harder it is to come around.

2320
02:01:56.08 --> 02:01:59.08
So yeah, that's a debate for sure.

2321
02:01:59.08 --> 02:02:01.08
And then I had a bad, no, I had a dream.

2322
02:02:01.08 --> 02:02:03.08
I had a bad dream.

2323
02:02:03.08 --> 02:02:05.08
I had a dream the other night.

2324
02:02:05.08 --> 02:02:09.08
I'm in like somewhere, some foreign country.

2325
02:02:09.08 --> 02:02:13.08
And something happens.

2326
02:02:13.08 --> 02:02:16.08
And we like get the call like, hey, we got to go right now.

2327
02:02:16.08 --> 02:02:18.08
And so I run to get my gear.

2328
02:02:18.08 --> 02:02:21.08
I pick up my gear and my magazines are not loaded.

2329
02:02:21.08 --> 02:02:24.08
And the helicopter's coming into like, take us to do whatever we got to do.

2330
02:02:24.08 --> 02:02:25.08
There's guys in trouble.

2331
02:02:25.08 --> 02:02:29.08
The helicopter comes in and I'm sitting there loading mags as fast as I can.

2332
02:02:29.08 --> 02:02:31.08
And then I'm running.

2333
02:02:31.08 --> 02:02:36.08
And I see the helicopter leaving with like my guys on board and it's leaving.

2334
02:02:36.08 --> 02:02:37.08
And I missed it.

2335
02:02:37.08 --> 02:02:39.08
Like they had to go.

2336
02:02:39.08 --> 02:02:42.08
And, bro, I mean, I was just like feeling sick.

2337
02:02:42.08 --> 02:02:45.08
And I woke up and it took me, you know, whatever.

2338
02:02:45.08 --> 02:02:49.08
Ten seconds to realize that it didn't really happen.

2339
02:02:49.08 --> 02:02:51.08
And so I had the worst feeling ever.

2340
02:02:51.08 --> 02:02:54.08
And then five seconds later, I'm like super thankful.

2341
02:02:54.08 --> 02:02:57.08
And then I'm bummed out again because it happened.

2342
02:02:57.08 --> 02:02:58.08
You were brave.

2343
02:02:58.08 --> 02:02:59.08
No, right, that makes sense.

2344
02:02:59.08 --> 02:03:01.08
I was gonna like kind of tease you whatever.

2345
02:03:01.08 --> 02:03:02.08
You're like, we're talking about.

2346
02:03:02.08 --> 02:03:04.08
But I said I can dream.

2347
02:03:04.08 --> 02:03:05.08
Not with that kind of stuff.

2348
02:03:05.08 --> 02:03:06.08
Obviously, but it was with football games.

2349
02:03:06.08 --> 02:03:09.08
Like I'm like trying to make it to the football game or whatever.

2350
02:03:09.08 --> 02:03:11.08
And then I can like hear on the radio.

2351
02:03:11.08 --> 02:03:12.08
It's like half time.

2352
02:03:12.08 --> 02:03:13.08
You know, that's where you're into the first quarter.

2353
02:03:13.08 --> 02:03:15.08
And I'm like, not even at the game yet.

2354
02:03:15.08 --> 02:03:17.08
And it's like, you know, it's third quarter.

2355
02:03:17.08 --> 02:03:19.08
And I get there in the game is like finishing.

2356
02:03:19.08 --> 02:03:20.08
Two.

2357
02:03:20.08 --> 02:03:25.08
We never would have anticipated in one million years that you had some kind of anxiety about being late for it.

2358
02:03:25.08 --> 02:03:26.08
In the end.

2359
02:03:26.08 --> 02:03:27.08
Yeah.

2360
02:03:27.08 --> 02:03:28.08
Okay.

2361
02:03:28.08 --> 02:03:29.08
Yeah.

2362
02:03:29.08 --> 02:03:38.08
Well, hey, maybe there's some circular thing that kind of makes it all makes sense.

2363
02:03:38.08 --> 02:03:39.08
You know, I don't know.

2364
02:03:39.08 --> 02:03:41.08
No, no.

2365
02:03:41.08 --> 02:03:42.08
Psychological warfare.

2366
02:03:42.08 --> 02:03:44.08
I was going to, okay, we got to explain what it is.

2367
02:03:44.08 --> 02:03:46.08
And again, back to the one.

2368
02:03:46.08 --> 02:03:47.08
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2369
02:03:47.08 --> 02:03:48.08
Some people there.

2370
02:03:48.08 --> 02:03:49.08
Anyway, get to our sleep.

2371
02:03:49.08 --> 02:03:50.08
Get eight hours.

2372
02:03:50.08 --> 02:03:51.08

02:03:51.08 --> 02:03:52.08
Sleep, I don't know.

2374
02:03:52.08 --> 02:03:55.08
Sometimes you're in the mood or you're not in the mood to do whether it be a workout, whether it be a.

2375
02:03:55.08 --> 02:03:57.08
Maintain the diet situation.

2376
02:03:57.08 --> 02:03:58.08
Boom.

2377
02:03:58.08 --> 02:03:59.08

Jockel.

2379
02:04:00.08 --> 02:04:05.08
Telling you why you don't want to do these things that support your moment of weakness.

2380
02:04:05.08 --> 02:04:06.08
Boom.

2381
02:04:06.08 --> 02:04:07.08
Get through it.

2382
02:04:07.08 --> 02:04:08.08
Easy money.

2383

We got discipline.

2391
02:04:25.08 --> 02:04:26.08

Also we have National Unfront Leadership Consultancy where we solve problems through leadership.

This is going to sell out too.

2431
02:06:00.08 --> 02:06:02.08
We got compressed space.

2432
02:06:02.08 --> 02:06:03.08
Well, not compressed space.

2433
02:06:03.08 --> 02:06:07.08
We got compressed seats in big space because of social distancing.

2434
02:06:07.08 --> 02:06:08.08
So there's less tickets to sell.

2435
02:06:08.08 --> 02:06:10.08
So it's going to sell out early.

2436
02:06:10.08 --> 02:06:13.08
So be advised on that.

2437
02:06:13.08 --> 02:06:15.08

the military experience and leadership that we talk about.

2441

02:06:28.08 --> 02:06:30.08
To find those leaders.

02:06:30.08 --> 02:06:34.08
And if you want to help service members.

2445
02:06:34.08 --> 02:06:36.08
You want to help active duty.

2446
02:06:36.08 --> 02:06:37.08
You want to help retired.

2447
02:06:37.08 --> 02:06:39.08
You want to help their families.

2448
02:06:39.08 --> 02:06:41.08
Gold star families.

2449
02:06:41.08 --> 02:06:46.08
Then check out america's mighty warriors dot org.

2450
02:06:46.08 --> 02:06:50.08
That is Mark Lee's mom's charity organization.

02:06:50.08 --> 02:06:51.08
Mamla Lee.

2452
02:06:51.08 --> 02:06:55.08
She's out there helping our veterans.

2453
02:06:55.08 --> 02:07:00.08
And if you are into.

2454
02:07:00.08 --> 02:07:05.08
If you want to torture yourself.

2455
02:07:05.08 --> 02:07:10.08
And you want more of my weary summer words.

2456
02:07:10.08 --> 02:07:19.08
Or you need more of echoes sort of viable sermons of which there were plenty of today.

2457
02:07:19.08 --> 02:07:27.08
Or you can't wait to hear just a few more of Dave's jubilant judgments.

2458
02:07:27.08 --> 02:07:31.08
Then you can find us on the inner webs on Twitter on Instagram,

2459
02:07:31.08 --> 02:07:36.08
which according to echo Charles should only be known as the Graham.

2460
02:07:36.08 --> 02:07:39.08
And on Facebook Dave is at David R. Burke.

2461
02:07:39.08 --> 02:07:42.08
Echo is at echo Charles and I am at joklin Lincoln.

2462
02:07:42.08 --> 02:07:45.08
Once again, thanks to General Bruce Clark and Colonel David Hacworth.

2463
02:07:45.08 --> 02:07:50.08
For continuing to serve our great nation with the lessons you have passed on to us.

2464
02:07:50.08 --> 02:07:53.08
And thanks to all the military troops out there.

2465
02:07:53.08 --> 02:07:56.08
On the sea air and land.

2466
02:07:56.08 --> 02:08:00.08
That maintain vigilance at all times for our security.

2467
02:08:00.08 --> 02:08:03.08
And thanks to the police and law enforcement firefighters,

2468
02:08:03.08 --> 02:08:07.08
Paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, board of patrol,

2469
02:08:07.08 --> 02:08:12.08
Secret Service and all the other first responders who also remain vigilant to keep us safe.

2470
02:08:12.08 --> 02:08:16.08
Here at home and to everyone out there.

2471
02:08:16.08 --> 02:08:22.08
Once again, from General Bruce C. Clark, quote,

2472
02:08:22.08 --> 02:08:26.08
The attack is the key to success.

2473
02:08:26.08 --> 02:08:32.08
The defense is merely a temporary expedient to conserve forces for an attack elsewhere.

2474
02:08:32.08 --> 02:08:40.08
Or to prepare for an attack at a future date and quote.

2475
02:08:40.08 --> 02:08:45.08
You know what to do. Go out on the attack.

2476
02:08:45.08 --> 02:08:51.08
And until next time, this is Dave, Heneco and Jokko.

2477
02:08:51.08 --> 02:09:11.08
Out.
