But, you know, as far as the pay off, you know, debtor, it, you know, it's like basically, so if I test my willpower, I'm just saying throughout the span of a day or, you know, however many hours when you start to get hungry. Yeah, it'll back for, like, for example, I'll be like, I don't have to, you feel like you don't have to get the most out of your workout, because I could just come right back here, you know, in an hour when I quote unquote, feel better or when I feel more like doing it. That's one, two, the whole broadcasting yourself thing is totally understandable for someone like you and that, that it's good that you kind of got your kind of got turned on to the notion that it's more, you have really good messages and good content that will improve people in their, in their life, whether it be older people, younger people, girls, guys, everything.

Or I just, you know, I don't know, strike your throat or something like this, right? That's going to take and it's the same thing with Shakespeare people like, hey, when you're going to do the barred and it's the same thing.

I got to bring my oxygen tank because of, you know, I don't know, no specifically why. I had guys with me, you know, in my task unit and some of those guys were so brave that I didn't think they were going to make it home. And, and she put a picture on the internet, the other day on Twitter, of her at the gym and she's got, you know, like a kettlebell, um, a medicine ball, and an oxygen tank. and I actually get people who is like, hey, do Blood Meridian do Blood Meridian because there are a lot of people that take a lot of information a lot of meaning from that book.
