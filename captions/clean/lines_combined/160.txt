00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000 Everybody.
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.40 And he will Heep
00:00:05.12 --> 00:00:06.92 who we hope
00:00:06.92 --> 00:00:08.04 can be
00:00:08.04 --> 00:00:10.000 from the world to death.
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.72 He may be
00:00:14.44 --> 00:00:17.70 died
00:00:17.70 --> 00:00:43.98 Good. Good. This is Jockel Podcast number 160. With echo Charles and me, Jockel
00:00:43.98 --> 00:01:02.98 and me, I'm going to go. Good evening. Good evening. October. I'm going to head your way
00:01:02.98 --> 00:01:17.46 and see you today. Though sometimes I wonder why I should. Sometimes you don't seem
00:01:17.46 --> 00:01:29.62 to care and that makes me mad brother. And then when I see you, it doesn't really make
00:01:29.62 --> 00:01:47.90 me feel any better. Shoot it. Is that what this is for? It doesn't seem to be. It actually
00:01:47.90 --> 00:01:59.44 just makes me remember the way things used to be. Better times. It makes me
00:01:59.44 --> 00:02:12.24 wonder why things turned out this way. What did I do wrong? Should I have done something
00:02:12.24 --> 00:02:30.64 different? What could I have said? You never let me down ever. But now you won't even talk
00:02:30.64 --> 00:02:41.84 to me. I was looking at some of the things you wrote to me in the past. I opened up an
00:02:41.84 --> 00:02:54.88 email. In it, you wrote, I feel it again washing over me. The descent into degeneration
00:02:54.88 --> 00:03:04.96 and disintegration, the smell of filth, black water mixed with blood and gunpowder and shit.
00:03:04.96 --> 00:03:17.32 The American soldier covered in filth 11 months into a 16 month deployment. The insurgents
00:03:17.32 --> 00:03:26.72 grown men hiding behind children. Women wailing over the dead, explosions and screams
00:03:26.72 --> 00:03:36.80 and fragments of concrete flying through the air and frog men enter the scene to take the
00:03:36.80 --> 00:03:43.88 hand of the American soldier and pull him from the whirlpool to set his feet back on the
00:03:43.88 --> 00:03:52.64 rock and speak words of hope. We are the prophets of doom and destruction. We enter an
00:03:52.64 --> 00:04:02.16 area and take back the lost pride of America. We redden the stripes blue the field and
00:04:02.16 --> 00:04:11.52 make the stars of our tattered and humiliated battleants and shine once again. We hold it
00:04:11.52 --> 00:04:22.72 high. We carry a nation on our shoulders and we bring the enemy to its knees. We do not live
00:04:22.72 --> 00:04:33.76 in fear of death or wounding or even worse rejection by the country we love. I feel my mind
00:04:33.76 --> 00:04:43.52 becoming a part and the old sleeping animal coming out. I tried to keep it inside but it
00:04:43.52 --> 00:05:00.68 cannot help but attend the call to battle. When you originally wrote that to me I thought
00:05:00.68 --> 00:05:19.64 to myself. Yup. He's there again. Where he should be. I knew it wouldn't last forever. But
00:05:19.64 --> 00:05:32.84 where are you now? Now you see distant. In my head I can see you smile. I can hear you laugh
00:05:32.84 --> 00:05:44.08 but it's only in my head. I was surfing the other day. It was one of those days of good
00:05:44.08 --> 00:05:57.64 day. Solid swell. No wind. Tied was low and the sky was clear and bright. I kept looking
00:05:57.64 --> 00:06:09.36 out toward the outside where you used to sit and wait for the big set waves. I thought
00:06:09.36 --> 00:06:22.28 I saw you a couple times but it wasn't you. I heard someone paddling behind me must be
00:06:22.28 --> 00:06:41.52 you. I thought no. Nothing. No one's there. I'm all alone out here. Everything is the
00:06:41.52 --> 00:06:52.20 same but nothing is the same. Everything is changed but nothing is changed.
00:06:52.20 --> 00:07:06.20 Does anything ever change? Look at the waves as they approach the shore. Each wave formed
00:07:06.20 --> 00:07:17.24 through random combinations of wind and sea and pressure and each one completely unique.
00:07:17.24 --> 00:07:29.48 Then they break. They're gone forever. But then another one comes behind it and another
00:07:29.48 --> 00:07:42.84 one. They are all different but they're all the same. And I see some of the past and the
00:07:42.84 --> 00:07:52.84 future and I see some of the future in the past and I begin to wonder which is which.
00:07:52.84 --> 00:08:08.96 How did I get here? Where am I going to end up? Where are you? I look at some more
00:08:08.96 --> 00:08:23.04 you're writing. You are telling a story, writing a story about a man, about God, about life,
00:08:23.04 --> 00:08:37.64 about death. And this is what you wrote. I am ready to go. He thought to himself. But for you,
00:08:37.64 --> 00:08:47.000 I wait for the appointed time. They will. He said to himself and closed his eyes and placed
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:57.44 his hands on the pages as if there was some strength there and he prayed. While he prayed,
00:08:57.44 --> 00:09:10.48 he also thought of past times. He breathed in deep and exiled. Deliver us from the evil one,
00:09:10.48 --> 00:09:21.44 he muttered. And he thought of all the reasons he had no right to say this prayer. At that,
00:09:21.44 --> 00:09:30.64 he stated himself, opened his eyes and looked out into the first light of the morning. He saw
00:09:30.64 --> 00:09:40.88 a face not his own looking back at him from the window and disappear. But he was not startled. This
00:09:40.88 --> 00:09:52.56 kind of thing was normal. I'm ready for you. He thought to himself. While he ran that morning,
00:09:52.56 --> 00:09:59.68 he did not think about anything. His mind retreated deep into itself, or perhaps it shut down
00:09:59.68 --> 00:10:07.84 altogether and he wore no expression. He only looked out at the sea and watched as the sea birds
00:10:07.84 --> 00:10:13.92 glided above the undulating plane of water, moving close above its surface, but managing somehow,
00:10:14.72 --> 00:10:22.56 not to touch it. At home, he heaved weights around on a small concrete slab.
00:10:24.32 --> 00:10:30.32 His routine effortlessly recited and at the same time painfully undertaken again
00:10:30.32 --> 00:10:42.40 without fought or care. Every morning the same, marking off time until an appointed end,
00:10:44.64 --> 00:10:45.92 his final rendezvous.
00:10:52.88 --> 00:10:53.76 That's what you wrote.
00:10:53.76 --> 00:11:00.000 Is that what we are doing here?
00:11:01.52 --> 00:11:04.16 Marking off time until an appointed end?
00:11:08.72 --> 00:11:11.60 My memory plays tricks on me.
00:11:15.20 --> 00:11:17.84 How many days do I remember?
00:11:17.84 --> 00:11:23.44 How many days do I actually remember?
00:11:27.44 --> 00:11:30.56 And what good is a day that I can't remember?
00:11:33.76 --> 00:11:37.60 Did it happen? Did it exist?
00:11:37.60 --> 00:11:44.16 I want to remember every day, but I can't.
00:11:48.88 --> 00:11:53.44 I let some of them go and I hate that.
00:11:53.44 --> 00:12:04.64 I want to remember and remember the times we had together.
00:12:09.36 --> 00:12:16.64 We played songs on the guitar, but I can't hear them anymore.
00:12:16.64 --> 00:12:28.24 They are gone. I can't recreate them.
00:12:32.24 --> 00:12:33.28 I'm not good enough.
00:12:37.84 --> 00:12:40.24 Can we play them again?
00:12:40.24 --> 00:12:44.40 One more song.
00:12:51.52 --> 00:12:52.96 Here is some more of your writing.
00:12:56.80 --> 00:12:58.32 I am God's messenger.
00:13:00.16 --> 00:13:03.04 I am a chieftain of Michael the angel.
00:13:05.76 --> 00:13:08.08 He has granted my request to help you
00:13:08.08 --> 00:13:11.36 for his you who are doing the bidding of the king.
00:13:13.68 --> 00:13:15.28 We have heard your many prayers.
00:13:16.72 --> 00:13:19.20 They burn before us day and night.
00:13:19.20 --> 00:13:22.24 Yes, heaven is full of the fragrance of your prayers.
00:13:24.80 --> 00:13:28.40 And I bring glad tidings from the Lord of Lords.
00:13:31.76 --> 00:13:34.000 He is preparing his mount to ride here.
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.36 But there is still more to be done on earth before he wields his scythe and sword upon it.
00:13:45.36 --> 00:13:46.40 I bring a message.
00:13:48.32 --> 00:13:55.68 The Lord of Lords wants to help you reap the spirits against whom you are warring.
00:13:55.68 --> 00:14:01.68 Indeed, Satan has asked to have you.
00:14:03.92 --> 00:14:05.52 But we will not let that happen.
00:14:09.12 --> 00:14:12.000 Of course, you always have a choice.
00:14:14.32 --> 00:14:15.76 I have come a long way though.
00:14:18.08 --> 00:14:20.48 I came when we heard your last prayer.
00:14:20.48 --> 00:14:25.44 You will not be turned.
00:14:34.96 --> 00:14:39.84 When I read that, it seems obvious.
00:14:42.88 --> 00:14:44.56 Even God was on your side.
00:14:44.56 --> 00:14:46.56 God.
00:14:48.96 --> 00:14:51.92 But if God was on your side, how did you end up like this then?
00:14:55.52 --> 00:14:57.52 How could you do this to me?
00:15:00.08 --> 00:15:00.88 What about me?
00:15:03.28 --> 00:15:04.24 Yeah, I know.
00:15:04.24 --> 00:15:15.20 I'm being selfish, but what about me?
00:15:15.20 --> 00:15:16.96 What I'm not going to see you today, you can wait.
00:15:20.88 --> 00:15:25.76 After everything I did for you, after everything we went through together,
00:15:25.76 --> 00:15:30.40 you can wait.
00:15:37.12 --> 00:15:37.76 December.
00:15:43.04 --> 00:15:43.44 Okay.
00:15:46.64 --> 00:15:47.84 I calm down a little bit.
00:15:47.84 --> 00:15:56.24 I pride myself in keeping control of my emotions,
00:15:58.08 --> 00:16:03.28 but I got to admit, you had me break down a little bit for a while.
00:16:05.12 --> 00:16:05.76 Do you see that?
00:16:09.20 --> 00:16:10.40 You probably laugh at me.
00:16:12.16 --> 00:16:14.40 So I'm going to come up and see you today.
00:16:14.40 --> 00:16:15.44 Okay.
00:16:17.04 --> 00:16:18.08 Is that cool?
00:16:20.48 --> 00:16:22.48 I mean, it's supposed to be cool.
00:16:25.76 --> 00:16:29.92 If nothing else, just to say goodbye.
00:16:33.20 --> 00:16:34.80 I'll bring you a beer or two.
00:16:37.44 --> 00:16:39.60 I don't even drink anymore, but you know what?
00:16:39.60 --> 00:16:43.52 If you crack one open with me, I'll have one with you.
00:16:46.64 --> 00:16:47.60 Like old times.
00:16:52.64 --> 00:16:53.92 What happened to those times?
00:16:58.96 --> 00:16:59.92 We were brothers.
00:16:59.92 --> 00:17:07.20 And when we came home, we knew.
00:17:08.96 --> 00:17:09.60 We made it.
00:17:12.56 --> 00:17:13.92 We made it, man.
00:17:16.72 --> 00:17:21.52 As crazy it seems, I was actually never that worried about you.
00:17:24.64 --> 00:17:25.76 Maybe you were blessed.
00:17:25.76 --> 00:17:28.56 Maybe you were lucky.
00:17:28.56 --> 00:17:31.60 Maybe it was both, but whatever it was, it worked.
00:17:36.48 --> 00:17:38.80 You even wrote to me during your next deployment.
00:17:41.92 --> 00:17:43.04 This is what you wrote.
00:17:45.12 --> 00:17:49.12 All I interject is my part, the firing and yelling part.
00:17:51.60 --> 00:17:53.28 But the bullets do not hit me.
00:17:53.28 --> 00:17:56.000 They never hit me. They passed through me like a miracle.
00:17:59.36 --> 00:18:03.44 Two days ago, we drove through a village and knocked all the power lines down.
00:18:04.32 --> 00:18:08.08 And it was night and the sparks were like incoming RPGs.
00:18:11.12 --> 00:18:14.08 I wished they were and brazed.
00:18:17.28 --> 00:18:17.92 But they were.
00:18:19.84 --> 00:18:21.60 And the IEDs won't come either.
00:18:21.60 --> 00:18:22.56 They won't hit me.
00:18:24.80 --> 00:18:28.72 It's like I'm being protected.
00:18:34.40 --> 00:18:37.84 You capitalize the P in protected.
00:18:41.44 --> 00:18:43.28 You believed it was a higher power.
00:18:43.28 --> 00:18:49.36 I can't write the argue with you on that.
00:18:55.36 --> 00:19:00.56 But if that's so true, how did this happen?
00:19:02.96 --> 00:19:04.16 Why did this happen?
00:19:04.16 --> 00:19:06.16 Where did that protection go?
00:19:09.84 --> 00:19:11.52 Did it abandon you?
00:19:11.52 --> 00:19:13.04 Like you abandoned me?
00:19:17.04 --> 00:19:18.48 What am I supposed to do now?
00:19:26.24 --> 00:19:26.80 You know what?
00:19:29.12 --> 00:19:30.56 I'm not going to see you today.
00:19:30.56 --> 00:19:40.72 Okay, you can wait.
00:19:43.76 --> 00:19:44.40 February.
00:19:47.84 --> 00:19:48.80 It's a new year.
00:19:50.88 --> 00:19:51.84 Let's try this again.
00:19:56.32 --> 00:19:58.80 Time heals all wounds.
00:19:58.80 --> 00:20:01.28 They say, so we should be good now, right?
00:20:04.16 --> 00:20:06.24 I should be over it all by now.
00:20:07.92 --> 00:20:11.60 I'll come see you and at a minimum, say goodbye.
00:20:11.60 --> 00:20:14.40 Just say goodbye.
00:20:14.40 --> 00:20:15.92 Just tell you that's it.
00:20:17.12 --> 00:20:18.08 No hard feelings.
00:20:18.08 --> 00:20:19.28 Don't take it personally.
00:20:19.28 --> 00:20:26.72 I've decided I'm going to go ahead and proceed on down the path without you.
00:20:30.56 --> 00:20:30.96 Alone.
00:20:34.96 --> 00:20:36.24 And I'm used to being alone.
00:20:38.08 --> 00:20:38.80 No big deal.
00:20:40.64 --> 00:20:41.44 I kind of like it.
00:20:41.44 --> 00:20:48.000 But even I have to admit it was nice.
00:20:51.28 --> 00:20:52.88 Nice to have someone to talk to.
00:20:52.88 --> 00:20:55.76 Nice to have someone to talk to without even talking.
00:20:55.76 --> 00:21:08.40 I think a look, a nod, a smile.
00:21:09.68 --> 00:21:11.52 No one is smiling back anymore.
00:21:16.56 --> 00:21:16.96 No one.
00:21:16.96 --> 00:21:25.20 Sometimes I look up at the night sky.
00:21:29.44 --> 00:21:31.44 That can approximate a smile.
00:21:35.20 --> 00:21:36.88 I see a smile in the sunset.
00:21:38.64 --> 00:21:39.36 I don't know why.
00:21:41.68 --> 00:21:45.12 I try to milk what I can out of every day.
00:21:45.12 --> 00:21:47.12 I should be cursing the sunset.
00:21:52.64 --> 00:21:54.64 That sunset means another day is gone.
00:21:59.68 --> 00:22:01.36 I should be cursing it, but I don't.
00:22:04.64 --> 00:22:07.28 I take a few minutes when I can and I watch it.
00:22:07.28 --> 00:22:13.28 Good night, Al-Hui.
00:22:15.84 --> 00:22:17.20 Good night, Chesty.
00:22:19.68 --> 00:22:20.96 Good night, Stoner.
00:22:27.12 --> 00:22:30.48 Maybe there's some relief that the day has gone.
00:22:30.48 --> 00:22:31.28 Is that it?
00:22:31.28 --> 00:22:34.48 That part of the race is over and there is an
00:22:34.48 --> 00:22:36.48 a damn thing I can do about it.
00:22:44.08 --> 00:22:45.84 When my oldest daughter was little,
00:22:48.08 --> 00:22:52.000 we would watch the sunset over the ocean
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.04 when we'd get the chance.
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.04 When she was at that age,
00:22:58.08 --> 00:22:59.92 when she was only just starting to talk,
00:22:59.92 --> 00:23:05.44 she could just say a handful of words.
00:23:06.32 --> 00:23:08.64 When she wanted a drink of milk,
00:23:09.52 --> 00:23:11.04 she would say nook.
00:23:14.56 --> 00:23:16.32 When she wanted to go on the swing,
00:23:16.32 --> 00:23:17.20 she would say,
00:23:17.20 --> 00:23:17.52 Ving!
00:23:21.84 --> 00:23:24.96 When I would throw up her up in the air and catch her,
00:23:24.96 --> 00:23:28.88 she would laugh and she would giggle and she would say the word,
00:23:28.88 --> 00:23:29.52 again.
00:23:34.96 --> 00:23:37.12 And she and I were sitting on the sea wall.
00:23:38.48 --> 00:23:42.88 It was autumn and the sun was leaning towards the south
00:23:42.88 --> 00:23:48.96 and we watched and she watched the colors in the sky,
00:23:48.96 --> 00:23:57.28 red and yellow and orange, like fire and the water ignited,
00:23:59.84 --> 00:24:04.80 then it turned black and the sun disappeared into the ocean
00:24:04.80 --> 00:24:08.48 and she looked up at me and she said, again!
00:24:08.48 --> 00:24:14.80 She wanted it back,
00:24:22.56 --> 00:24:24.24 but I couldn't do anything for her.
00:24:29.92 --> 00:24:30.80 I was powerless.
00:24:30.80 --> 00:24:36.08 I still am.
00:24:38.56 --> 00:24:42.08 I can't stop the clock and I can't bring back a day,
00:24:42.08 --> 00:24:46.64 not one single day, not one single minute,
00:24:46.64 --> 00:24:48.24 you get what you get.
00:24:54.32 --> 00:24:57.92 And that sunset will keep a man's ego in check,
00:24:57.92 --> 00:25:01.52 especially when you're complete lack of control
00:25:01.52 --> 00:25:03.84 disappoints the little angel sitting on your knee.
00:25:12.08 --> 00:25:14.08 And I can't control this situation either.
00:25:17.20 --> 00:25:18.24 And that's things.
00:25:21.52 --> 00:25:22.88 And I don't want to face that.
00:25:22.88 --> 00:25:28.08 I don't want to say goodbye.
00:25:30.64 --> 00:25:31.20 That can wait.
00:25:35.12 --> 00:25:35.68 You can wait.
00:25:43.28 --> 00:25:43.60 May.
00:25:46.88 --> 00:25:47.68 Springtime.
00:25:47.68 --> 00:25:51.20 Springtime.
00:25:51.20 --> 00:25:52.40 Rebirth.
00:25:52.40 --> 00:25:53.60 So I'm told.
00:25:57.20 --> 00:25:59.60 The winter swell fades, but the water warms up.
00:26:02.08 --> 00:26:03.20 The days get longer again.
00:26:08.08 --> 00:26:08.56 I like that.
00:26:11.60 --> 00:26:13.04 I look at more of your words.
00:26:13.04 --> 00:26:19.04 They read, he found a sleeping spot.
00:26:20.80 --> 00:26:23.04 Happy and excited with anticipation.
00:26:23.04 --> 00:26:26.16 He thought of the glory which was to come and he slept
00:26:26.16 --> 00:26:28.000 tranquil and did not dream.
00:26:30.80 --> 00:26:34.32 The blue midnight sky held no trace of trouble,
00:26:34.32 --> 00:26:35.60 almost no clouds.
00:26:36.88 --> 00:26:40.24 Only a whisp of silver gray near the moon
00:26:40.24 --> 00:26:43.20 that seemed to be something beautiful for the humans
00:26:43.20 --> 00:26:47.52 below to look at as an omen that something good might happen.
00:26:49.68 --> 00:26:52.48 As some kind of sign that heaven awaited it,
00:26:55.12 --> 00:26:55.92 the good thing.
00:27:02.56 --> 00:27:04.32 The good thing, you wrote.
00:27:04.32 --> 00:27:07.68 You wrote.
00:27:07.68 --> 00:27:08.88 What am I supposed to do with that?
00:27:13.20 --> 00:27:14.80 You set me up, you know,
00:27:16.08 --> 00:27:18.24 with thoughts of the good thing.
00:27:21.52 --> 00:27:22.96 Because there we were.
00:27:25.76 --> 00:27:28.96 You know, we were headed in the right direction
00:27:28.96 --> 00:27:34.48 toward the good things.
00:27:34.88 --> 00:27:38.24 When you listen to me, things worked out always.
00:27:39.92 --> 00:27:40.24 Right?
00:27:42.88 --> 00:27:43.52 You know it.
00:27:45.28 --> 00:27:50.16 When you listen to me and you put your damn heart in check,
00:27:50.16 --> 00:27:51.60 things worked out.
00:27:51.60 --> 00:27:56.000 You know, what's your problem?
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.76 You listen to your heart too much.
00:27:57.76 --> 00:27:58.40 You know this.
00:28:01.76 --> 00:28:03.92 Let your emotions get a hold of you.
00:28:03.92 --> 00:28:04.64 You know it's true.
00:28:06.56 --> 00:28:08.48 I told you a thousand times,
00:28:08.48 --> 00:28:09.60 ten thousand times,
00:28:12.08 --> 00:28:15.44 and you tried to listen and you did listen sometimes.
00:28:15.44 --> 00:28:16.56 Sometimes.
00:28:20.64 --> 00:28:24.88 But your heart couldn't be completely subdued.
00:28:24.88 --> 00:28:26.40 It was too strong.
00:28:28.72 --> 00:28:30.000 Too strong for its own good.
00:28:35.28 --> 00:28:37.36 And yeah, I know.
00:28:40.24 --> 00:28:43.60 I know that's what makes you, you.
00:28:43.60 --> 00:28:45.60 You find.
00:28:51.60 --> 00:28:52.80 But you should listen to me.
00:28:54.88 --> 00:28:57.20 You should have listened.
00:28:57.20 --> 00:29:08.16 And now I am here and you are there and there's nothing I can do about it.
00:29:13.52 --> 00:29:14.32 Comparison.
00:29:14.32 --> 00:29:25.20 Jullai.
00:29:28.08 --> 00:29:30.72 Full fledged summer now.
00:29:33.36 --> 00:29:35.84 Campfires and guitar on the regular.
00:29:38.88 --> 00:29:39.44 Where are you at?
00:29:39.44 --> 00:29:40.56 I'm at.
00:29:43.36 --> 00:29:44.56 And let me ask you something.
00:29:44.56 --> 00:29:47.84 If you aren't going to come around, then can you just let me be?
00:29:51.76 --> 00:29:53.76 I don't want you in my head right now.
00:29:56.32 --> 00:29:59.36 I don't want to get dragged back every time I strum a chord.
00:29:59.36 --> 00:30:00.48 I remember.
00:30:12.48 --> 00:30:14.48 We were traveling up the coast.
00:30:14.48 --> 00:30:17.92 You made lazy days.
00:30:21.20 --> 00:30:22.16 Surfing by day.
00:30:22.16 --> 00:30:29.52 Playing on the get boxes at night.
00:30:29.52 --> 00:30:31.76 We were looking for bigger waves.
00:30:31.76 --> 00:30:34.40 The kind of waves that get the blood flowing.
00:30:37.84 --> 00:30:38.56 We found so.
00:30:44.08 --> 00:30:45.68 But what were we really looking for?
00:30:45.68 --> 00:30:55.68 We were looking for that thing.
00:30:58.72 --> 00:30:59.36 That moment.
00:31:00.72 --> 00:31:03.68 That moment when nothing else matters.
00:31:05.28 --> 00:31:08.72 That moment that is sourced directly from the battlefield.
00:31:12.16 --> 00:31:13.36 Hard to find anywhere else.
00:31:13.36 --> 00:31:17.04 So we try and get close to it.
00:31:18.72 --> 00:31:22.96 Jujitsu surfing, whatever, but it's hard to replace.
00:31:22.96 --> 00:31:24.48 Maybe it can't be replaced.
00:31:28.88 --> 00:31:30.40 Maybe it just is what it is.
00:31:34.64 --> 00:31:36.000 I think I understood that.
00:31:39.20 --> 00:31:40.32 I'm not sure you did.
00:31:40.32 --> 00:31:47.12 I was able to rationalize it, figure out, detach from it.
00:31:48.32 --> 00:31:49.68 See it from the outside.
00:31:53.20 --> 00:31:55.28 Before that trip up the coast,
00:31:56.64 --> 00:31:58.48 you had written me these words.
00:32:00.96 --> 00:32:01.68 Send us.
00:32:01.68 --> 00:32:09.20 We are thirsty for screams and gore and hell and dirt and shit.
00:32:11.60 --> 00:32:17.60 We will hack our way through scores of bodies, form them up in a pile and burn them so we can
00:32:17.60 --> 00:32:18.88 kill by the pyre light.
00:32:21.68 --> 00:32:27.84 Somebody spread the good news that the killers teeth are sharp and their guns are clean and their
00:32:27.84 --> 00:32:33.36 souls are dead so no one needs anything but victory and sacred death.
00:32:33.36 --> 00:32:34.64 When is it done?
00:32:41.60 --> 00:32:43.52 You see that was your heart talking again.
00:32:47.20 --> 00:32:50.48 The same heart that wrapped around a girl you met.
00:32:50.48 --> 00:32:54.16 The same heart that brought my kids birthday presents.
00:32:54.16 --> 00:32:59.12 The same heart that was broken by the loss of our friends.
00:33:02.80 --> 00:33:08.64 A heart capable of both devotion and destruction.
00:33:13.52 --> 00:33:15.04 I told you to let it all go.
00:33:15.04 --> 00:33:23.04 I told you.
00:33:27.28 --> 00:33:28.80 But I can't control everything.
00:33:28.80 --> 00:33:42.40 I'm still powerless.
00:33:45.20 --> 00:33:45.84 September.
00:33:50.72 --> 00:33:52.32 A year has passed.
00:33:52.32 --> 00:33:56.64 Or was it yesterday?
00:34:00.32 --> 00:34:05.36 Time seems like a trick but the trick is on me because it's no trick at all.
00:34:05.36 --> 00:34:07.04 Time does not waver.
00:34:07.04 --> 00:34:08.72 It does not relinquish.
00:34:08.72 --> 00:34:10.08 It isn't tricky.
00:34:10.08 --> 00:34:11.04 It just is.
00:34:11.04 --> 00:34:19.28 It is moving on without judgment and without mercy and it will keep moving.
00:34:23.52 --> 00:34:25.12 I am coming up to see you today.
00:34:28.32 --> 00:34:28.96 I have to.
00:34:32.56 --> 00:34:33.84 I have to say goodbye.
00:34:33.84 --> 00:34:38.88 I can't do it like this anymore.
00:34:38.88 --> 00:34:40.88 Carrying you around in my head.
00:34:43.76 --> 00:34:49.36 Bringing back the past so often that it's interfering with the present and the future.
00:34:49.36 --> 00:34:50.32 That's not right.
00:34:53.12 --> 00:34:54.48 That wasn't part of the deal.
00:34:54.48 --> 00:35:03.44 I arrived.
00:35:09.28 --> 00:35:10.08 You're still there.
00:35:12.88 --> 00:35:13.76 What I left you.
00:35:13.76 --> 00:35:22.000 I brought you a beer and some wax for your board and a guitar pick.
00:35:24.40 --> 00:35:26.000 Even though you play better without one.
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000 I already went and saw Mikey and Mark.
00:35:36.88 --> 00:35:38.08 I save you for last.
00:35:38.08 --> 00:35:43.12 That's the way it is.
00:35:44.72 --> 00:35:45.84 You were the last to go.
00:35:55.20 --> 00:35:57.84 And this is the way it always ends.
00:36:01.44 --> 00:36:01.84 Here.
00:36:01.84 --> 00:36:05.68 It always ends like this.
00:36:09.52 --> 00:36:11.04 And I will end up here too.
00:36:16.64 --> 00:36:18.72 But I didn't know you'd end up here so soon.
00:36:18.72 --> 00:36:30.64 Here's your beer.
00:36:33.36 --> 00:36:35.04 I'll pour it in the grass for you.
00:36:35.04 --> 00:36:44.32 I'll put this bar of surf wax on top of your grapestone.
00:36:49.12 --> 00:36:50.56 Look at Tarpick next to it.
00:36:50.56 --> 00:37:04.80 I read the words.
00:37:04.80 --> 00:37:20.72 It's etched in that white granite rock.
00:37:19.28 --> 00:37:20.72 Seth A Stone.
00:37:25.76 --> 00:37:26.32 Commander.
00:37:26.32 --> 00:37:30.72 The US Navy.
00:37:31.76 --> 00:37:33.52 Afghanistan Iraq.
00:37:36.80 --> 00:37:39.76 September 17, 1976.
00:37:41.44 --> 00:37:44.96 September 30, 2017.
00:37:44.96 --> 00:37:52.96 Silver star with oak leaf cluster.
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.32 Bronze star metal with valor.
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.36 Faithful warrior.
00:38:05.36 --> 00:38:15.60 Faithful warrior.
00:38:15.60 --> 00:38:34.24 I always tell everyone to carry on.
00:38:38.08 --> 00:38:40.40 Tomorrow but not to dwell.
00:38:40.40 --> 00:38:48.40 But now I'm dwelling myself.
00:38:51.12 --> 00:38:56.32 And I know I shouldn't.
00:38:56.32 --> 00:39:10.88 I thought long and hard about it.
00:39:10.88 --> 00:39:26.32 And I was going to say goodbye.
00:39:26.88 --> 00:39:31.52 But I'm not going to say it.
00:39:34.64 --> 00:39:36.64 There's no need.
00:39:36.64 --> 00:39:40.32 You're still with me.
00:39:45.44 --> 00:39:50.64 You're in the ocean and in the sky and in the earth beneath my feet.
00:39:59.04 --> 00:39:59.92 You're still with me.
00:39:59.92 --> 00:40:05.44 And I'm good with that.
00:40:05.44 --> 00:40:31.68 Here's one more thing you wrote.
00:40:31.68 --> 00:40:35.68 I thought the enemy is good as I could.
00:40:38.48 --> 00:40:42.64 I lost myself but in doing so I found myself.
00:40:45.60 --> 00:40:46.40 It is a path.
00:40:49.20 --> 00:40:50.88 You have to work your own one out.
00:40:53.68 --> 00:40:54.64 It is a struggle.
00:40:54.64 --> 00:41:00.88 I've listened to the truth.
00:41:04.16 --> 00:41:09.52 I am humbled and mystified by this life we live.
00:41:09.52 --> 00:41:30.40 I am humbled and mystified by this life too.
00:41:30.40 --> 00:41:35.92 I am going to keep on living it.
00:41:35.92 --> 00:42:03.92 I can't stop the sunsets and I can't bring them back but I can make them count.
00:42:03.92 --> 00:42:09.76 And that is what I am going to do.
00:42:09.76 --> 00:42:29.28 I am going to keep on living and I am going to make it count.
00:42:39.76 --> 00:42:45.76 I am going to keep on living and I am going to make it count.
00:43:09.76 --> 00:43:32.08 So, here we are.
00:43:32.08 --> 00:43:54.56 And speaking of living life and trying to make it count, we are doing this gig here tonight.
00:43:54.56 --> 00:44:04.08 So, we are live.
00:44:24.56 --> 00:44:34.000 We generally call this a rough transition.
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.48 Yeah.
00:44:37.68 --> 00:44:44.08 So, everyone that is here our first live podcast.
00:44:46.08 --> 00:44:49.76 Thanks for everyone for thanks to everyone for coming down.
00:44:49.76 --> 00:45:11.52 As I thought about what to talk about tonight, I went down into a pretty heavy subject.
00:45:11.52 --> 00:45:19.52 And that is part of what this whole thing is.
00:45:23.12 --> 00:45:30.80 All the people that have reached out to me over the last few years that were able to overcome
00:45:30.80 --> 00:45:41.28 some tough situation because of the podcast and to the same with me.
00:45:42.32 --> 00:45:49.68 The same lessons that we have learned from the podcast, from books, from having people on.
00:45:50.56 --> 00:45:51.36 It is the same.
00:45:52.96 --> 00:45:55.36 We get the benefit of that too.
00:45:55.36 --> 00:46:04.24 And here we are.
00:46:04.24 --> 00:46:06.24 Here we are.
00:46:06.24 --> 00:46:11.20 So, thanks for coming.
00:46:13.60 --> 00:46:16.88 Echo Charles thanks for pressing record.
00:46:16.88 --> 00:46:26.88 And stop by the way, it is a whole thing.
00:46:29.36 --> 00:46:36.40 And one of the main things, and one of the main reasons I wanted to do a live podcast is to
00:46:36.40 --> 00:46:44.72 actually see everyone and give a chance for you to see us and for you to see what we do and what it looks like.
00:46:44.72 --> 00:46:46.72 And this is pretty much what it looks like.
00:46:46.72 --> 00:46:51.28 We are sitting in a small room and we press record and this is what we do.
00:46:52.40 --> 00:46:57.12 And it is great to have everyone here and to see your faces.
00:46:57.12 --> 00:46:58.56 And I have talked about this before.
00:46:58.56 --> 00:47:02.56 I mean, when I am recording, I am talking to you.
00:47:02.56 --> 00:47:06.72 I am talking to the people that I have heard from over the past few years.
00:47:06.72 --> 00:47:08.72 I know you are listening.
00:47:08.72 --> 00:47:13.20 And even from day one, I wanted to put on their headsets.
00:47:13.20 --> 00:47:16.48 And I wanted to think like, okay, yep, this is where going in.
00:47:16.48 --> 00:47:17.28 This is it.
00:47:17.28 --> 00:47:18.64 Like it is on.
00:47:18.64 --> 00:47:20.48 And I want you to waste your time.
00:47:20.48 --> 00:47:23.12 I don't want to waste your time.
00:47:24.48 --> 00:47:29.36 So, that is why we are doing this tonight.
00:47:29.36 --> 00:47:31.12 I thank you all for coming.
00:47:31.12 --> 00:47:38.40 I also want to take advantage of the fact that you are here to do some live Q&A, which is very fun for me to do.
00:47:38.40 --> 00:47:45.68 I enjoyed doing it. And we did solicit questions from the ticket sales.
00:47:46.80 --> 00:47:47.84 Did I just escalate that?
00:47:49.04 --> 00:47:52.24 Yeah, we did that for ticket sales.
00:47:54.56 --> 00:47:56.40 And so we got some of those questions here.
00:47:57.28 --> 00:47:58.88 And we will start off with a couple of those.
00:47:58.88 --> 00:48:02.64 And then we have got, you can bring the Q&A lights on.
00:48:03.44 --> 00:48:07.92 And then we are going to, we have got some folks out there, volunteers with microphones.
00:48:07.92 --> 00:48:14.64 And then once we will open it up and we are going to react and answer some questions.
00:48:15.60 --> 00:48:21.36 And I know some of you were waiting to get a picture of what you get some stuff signed before
00:48:21.68 --> 00:48:25.44 this started and we will finish this and we will wrap up that for everybody here.
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.88 So, it is awesome that you all are sitting here.
00:48:28.88 --> 00:48:30.16 I appreciate you coming down.
00:48:30.88 --> 00:48:33.52 And let's do a little Q&A.
00:48:33.52 --> 00:48:34.72 Yeah, yeah, all right.
00:48:34.72 --> 00:48:40.32 Yeah, it is interesting because usually we just sort of see the cameras.
00:48:40.32 --> 00:48:42.32 You know they are on the other side of the cameras.
00:48:44.64 --> 00:48:48.56 But you just see it and now it is like, oh, you actually see the view.
00:48:48.56 --> 00:48:49.28 It is different.
00:48:49.28 --> 00:48:50.64 It is different.
00:48:50.64 --> 00:48:53.52 So, all right, first question.
00:48:53.52 --> 00:48:55.04 Observation.
00:48:55.04 --> 00:48:58.32 Well, you see them saying like, now I look in the camera like, oh, okay.
00:48:58.32 --> 00:48:59.36 You see them saying?
00:48:59.36 --> 00:49:02.88 I'm just saying you see the people.
00:49:02.88 --> 00:49:03.92 Awesome.
00:49:03.92 --> 00:49:05.68 Well, let's not blow it anymore.
00:49:05.68 --> 00:49:08.64 Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
00:49:08.88 --> 00:49:12.88 Leaving in the first question, we can't edit out your stuff right?
00:49:12.88 --> 00:49:13.92 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:49:13.92 --> 00:49:16.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.44 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:49:17.44 --> 00:49:23.84 All right, Jocco, what impresses you the most when you're considering to work with someone or
00:49:23.84 --> 00:49:25.68 hire them to be part of your team?
00:49:25.68 --> 00:49:29.92 This is a question I get asked all the time, everybody wants them to know who to hire and what
00:49:29.92 --> 00:49:35.12 I look for and obviously I look for someone that's humble and I look for someone that's balanced
00:49:36.08 --> 00:49:43.12 and really, you know, it's one of those things where as much as you can before you hire someone
00:49:43.12 --> 00:49:47.04 get to know them and the advice we give people the national on front all the time when they're
00:49:47.04 --> 00:49:52.40 looking to hire someone is we say, look, if you can hire them temporarily, bring them on as
00:49:52.40 --> 00:49:56.96 a contractor for 90 days, you have to see them in the environment that they're actually going into,
00:49:56.96 --> 00:50:01.60 they're going to be working in before you know what they're really going to be like because just like
00:50:02.40 --> 00:50:07.60 going through, they screen people like crazy to go into seal training and they can't tell who's
00:50:07.60 --> 00:50:13.36 going to make it and who's not going to make it. They just can't tell and they you you work with
00:50:13.36 --> 00:50:17.20 people in the seal teams and you think you know what they're going to be like when you're going to
00:50:17.20 --> 00:50:22.32 combat but you just can't tell. You can have a decent idea but you just can't tell and so if you
00:50:22.32 --> 00:50:27.60 get the opportunity or the best way to do it is try and bring people on board in a temporary manner so
00:50:27.60 --> 00:50:31.44 you get to know them better and then once you know them you can either hire them or you can get
00:50:31.44 --> 00:50:36.32 rid of them easily. Next question makes sense.
00:50:38.16 --> 00:50:44.80 Hi, Jaco for a new entrepreneur or someone new to a leadership position who is meeting with their
00:50:44.80 --> 00:50:51.44 employees or direct report or direct reports for the first time. What are some key things to address
00:50:51.44 --> 00:50:57.84 during that initial conversation? As soon as you meet someone that's going to be working for you,
00:50:59.84 --> 00:51:05.36 you're immediately making impressions so we want to make a good impression. We also don't want to go
00:51:05.36 --> 00:51:12.000 okay it's a it's a dichotomy because you're immediately building a relationship with them but you can't
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.60 go overboard and be all buddy buddy. But that's why I followed the hack worth model and I actually
00:51:17.60 --> 00:51:23.12 took that to the next level. Hack worth wouldn't like laugh and joke around with the troops for six weeks.
00:51:24.32 --> 00:51:31.44 I up that to eight weeks because I'm a little bit more hard course. Yeah. So you but but one thing
00:51:31.44 --> 00:51:36.96 that's good out of the gate is put out some brief general guidelines like some some of the most
00:51:36.96 --> 00:51:42.24 broad guidance that you can possibly give which is hey look here's what's important to me. We're
00:51:42.24 --> 00:51:46.48 going to do a great job. We're going to work hard and this is our mission and this is what we're
00:51:46.48 --> 00:51:51.68 going to focus on and that's it. You don't need to come out of the gate trying to show everyone that
00:51:51.68 --> 00:51:57.76 you're the man. You don't need to do that guess what you're the boss you actually de facto are the
00:51:57.76 --> 00:52:04.96 man so don't run around and try and prove yourself out of the gate. Get to know them let that
00:52:04.96 --> 00:52:10.08 relationship build over time and that's we're going to end up in the best situation. Make sense.
00:52:10.08 --> 00:52:18.64 You sort of did that to me even as friends like this like here here good to meet you here's you
00:52:19.44 --> 00:52:31.84 good to meet you eight weeks just like that next question yeah well it's funny too because now when I meet
00:52:31.84 --> 00:52:38.48 people like tonight I'm all nice to everyone now yeah yeah you changed you but if I was going to be
00:52:38.48 --> 00:52:42.96 like getting in the game with them and somehow yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
00:52:42.96 --> 00:52:49.52 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that eight week probationary jacco period who are some of the well-known
00:52:49.52 --> 00:52:55.76 leaders today who you believe best exemplify extreme ownership be it in politics military or business
00:52:55.76 --> 00:53:07.04 military you know obviously I like like like matters a lot not effect I like matters yeah yeah yeah yeah
00:53:08.72 --> 00:53:14.80 I I generally same thing yep and McMaster same thing all those guys are awesome uh
00:53:14.80 --> 00:53:19.28 chronic pharlin or general McFarlin who who just retired who I worked with four in the body who is awesome
00:53:19.28 --> 00:53:25.84 so though there's a lot of really good military examples the business examples there's a mulalee who
00:53:25.84 --> 00:53:31.60 turned around forward there's a great book called American icon and it's a great leadership book
00:53:31.60 --> 00:53:37.20 I actually was going to cover it but I never did because it's hard to cover books about business
00:53:38.16 --> 00:53:43.36 compared to books about combat but it's a really good book American icon great ownership great attitude
00:53:43.36 --> 00:53:50.24 and politics this was a super hard one but then I just thought oh damn crunch off
00:53:51.28 --> 00:54:01.36 what up and really just the way dance and he's taking position like he's doing a great job
00:54:01.36 --> 00:54:10.96 it's very very cool to see so yeah there you go what else go to four cool
00:54:10.96 --> 00:54:17.28 hi jocco and echo I recently read the book Marine the life of Chesty Pillar and in the book
00:54:17.28 --> 00:54:23.28 Chesty references and the unnecessary loads of administrative paperwork that was required to be prepared
00:54:23.28 --> 00:54:29.36 for the military I also recently remember on a recent podcast you recalling a situation in
00:54:29.36 --> 00:54:35.76 Ramadi where you're platoon leaders we're not thrilled to fill out required paperwork I'm a squad
00:54:35.76 --> 00:54:42.24 sergeant in a prominent American police department and I'm experiencing the same dilemma
00:54:42.24 --> 00:54:48.48 the micromanaging and oversight is extreme and it's taking a toll on the morale of the officers
00:54:48.48 --> 00:54:56.16 citywide the tedious paperwork and constant micromanaging is preventing good cops from being proactive
00:54:56.16 --> 00:55:02.88 I feel like the job quote unquote has changed beyond recognition I had to appreciate your advice
00:55:02.88 --> 00:55:11.20 on how to approach the bullshit paperwork and increase the morale of my cops thank you for your time
00:55:12.16 --> 00:55:21.76 okay so what would I do in this situation first of all I am going to be awesome at the paperwork
00:55:21.76 --> 00:55:28.40 I'm gonna do it so well that because if you blow off the paperwork then you go to your boss and say
00:55:28.40 --> 00:55:32.16 the paperwork sucks and it's not any good the guy looks at you and says oh you know what you don't
00:55:32.16 --> 00:55:36.000 even not to do the paperwork how do you know how do you know if it's harder or not so what I'm going to
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.80 do is I'm going to do I'm going to start building a case that's what I'm going to do so I'm going to do
00:55:40.80 --> 00:55:45.28 the paperwork I'm actually going to log down how many hours I put into the paperwork I'm going to
00:55:45.28 --> 00:55:50.40 follow that paperwork and see where it goes and see if anyone actually reads it right because if I
00:55:50.40 --> 00:55:57.52 can go to my boss and say hey I spent 28 hours a week filing this paperwork and no not one single
00:55:57.52 --> 00:56:02.08 person read it and then you take the manpower of everyone in the department and then what you do is
00:56:02.08 --> 00:56:08.000 you actually build a case when you go into talk to the boss you should have a full magazine of
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:14.64 ammunition to combat this paperwork that you're being forced to do you have to be able to explain it
00:56:14.64 --> 00:56:23.68 to them in a rational logical manner and you can't you can't make any headway against your boss
00:56:23.68 --> 00:56:29.52 if you are trying to fight from the low ground the low ground is oh why don't really turn into
00:56:29.52 --> 00:56:34.000 paperwork and I don't really do the paperwork and I think the paperwork is crap then they're looking
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.08 down and you what are you talking about how are you dare you say that you don't even do it you don't
00:56:38.08 --> 00:56:42.96 even know what you're doing you got to get on the high ground how do you get on the high ground
00:56:43.68 --> 00:56:48.64 you get all that stuff done to the best of your ability you log down the hours it takes you get
00:56:48.64 --> 00:56:52.000 your whole little team doing it and you tell your whole team hey look I know this is painful right now
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:58.32 everyone in this squad everyone in this platoon is gonna do all this we're gonna log down what it takes
00:56:58.32 --> 00:57:05.20 because I am gonna bring a solid case up the chain of command of where we need to limit this paperwork
00:57:05.92 --> 00:57:11.28 this is a long war situation you know I'm gonna took to build up all that paperwork it took years
00:57:11.28 --> 00:57:17.60 it took 20 years 30 years for that to happen are you suggest you'll come out the number the Navy
00:57:17.60 --> 00:57:23.68 in the seal teams the range are range procedures are super loose we go out there and we shoot like crazy
00:57:23.68 --> 00:57:28.08 and do all kinds of really dynamic things and we sometimes go to a Marine Corps range it was like
00:57:28.08 --> 00:57:35.04 everything was super tight and I would tell my guys that say look that's because that happened over
00:57:35.04 --> 00:57:39.60 years one mistake happens how do you stop that mistake from happening again put a rule in place
00:57:39.60 --> 00:57:44.08 that stops it another mistake's happened another mistake happens put another rule in place another
00:57:44.08 --> 00:57:48.96 mistake happens put a piece of paper to stop it from happening again and eventually you end up with
00:57:48.96 --> 00:57:54.16 the range it's barely even usable so that's what happened in this department there was little
00:57:54.16 --> 00:57:58.40 things that happened over time and they built and they build upon themselves and the next thing
00:57:58.40 --> 00:58:04.80 you know you can't even recognize what your actual job was so we have to so that took 20 years to
00:58:04.80 --> 00:58:11.12 happen you're not gonna undo it overnight and you're definitely not gonna undo it from the
00:58:11.12 --> 00:58:18.40 low ground you have to get the high ground you have to be a performer if you're not a performer
00:58:18.40 --> 00:58:24.24 you have no say do your job do it well fight the long war
00:58:32.80 --> 00:58:36.48 I'm all of a sudden thinking like maybe we need one of those little applause tracks
00:58:36.48 --> 00:58:42.96 you know when I answer a question yeah yeah when it's good man it's good
00:58:45.52 --> 00:58:53.68 next question what book has had the biggest impact on you and is a must read
00:58:53.68 --> 00:59:03.92 yeah about face at work thanks for coming welcome to the club
00:59:05.92 --> 00:59:07.12 all right good on
00:59:10.88 --> 00:59:17.68 okay next first good morning was that like an erotic role band just let's the crowd sing the chorus
00:59:17.68 --> 00:59:25.20 and a little bit if you did not join the military what do you think you'd be doing right now
00:59:27.44 --> 00:59:34.24 I think I would have ended up either in the police department or a firefighter that's what I think
00:59:34.24 --> 00:59:38.000 I would have done if I couldn't have gotten into the military that's probably what I would have
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:49.92 done up doing why just because I had the urge to serve and do something physical and do something
00:59:49.92 --> 00:59:56.88 where I'm helping protect people I think that's why so I know there's a lot of cops and firefighters
00:59:56.88 --> 01:00:09.60 here so thanks for what you do
01:00:13.60 --> 01:00:17.28 what is the relationship between humility and vulnerability
01:00:17.28 --> 01:00:29.84 the relationship between humility and vulnerability okay interesting and there's an interesting
01:00:29.84 --> 01:00:38.24 dynamic that you get going on when you when you're humble okay so let's think about what happens
01:00:38.24 --> 01:00:44.96 when you're humble when you're humble you expose your vulnerabilities but what's cool is when you
01:00:44.96 --> 01:00:51.84 expose your vulnerabilities they become less vulnerable
01:00:52.80 --> 01:00:58.32 so that's why being humble is a win because if I'm taking over a position and I don't know how
01:00:58.32 --> 01:01:06.96 to do one of the jobs if I hide it it's it's haunting me and it's a weakness because as soon as
01:01:06.96 --> 01:01:12.48 it gets exposed I'm gonna look like you know weak and a loser but if I have a vulnerability
01:01:12.48 --> 01:01:18.32 and I'm humble enough to expose my vulnerability and say hey you know what guys I haven't actually
01:01:18.32 --> 01:01:22.32 done this before my old unit we didn't ever did this and I don't have to do it can I get some help
01:01:22.32 --> 01:01:27.60 here they're I'm being humble I'm exposing my vulnerability and all of a sudden it's not a
01:01:27.60 --> 01:01:34.56 vulnerability anymore because the because my team actually knows it and guess what then I get to
01:01:34.56 --> 01:01:40.56 practice and learn about the thing that was making me vulnerable yeah so
01:01:40.56 --> 01:01:46.88 making yourself vulnerable is fine and if you want to kill your vulnerabilities you have to
01:01:48.56 --> 01:01:55.44 be humble enough to expose them voluntarily voluntarily exposing your vulnerabilities
01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:04.16 is infinitely better than hiding them and letting them be uncovered by them you know
01:02:04.16 --> 01:02:11.52 it's not that's what it is it's it's it's animals like everyone else you're
01:02:11.52 --> 01:02:16.56 polluting if you have a vulnerability and you hide it and then they get it like they're
01:02:16.56 --> 01:02:25.20 coming at you with daggers with knives they're gonna get it so if you say hey this is the situation
01:02:25.92 --> 01:02:30.64 expose those vulnerability be humble enough to do that you'll be in a much better position
01:02:30.64 --> 01:02:36.88 yeah it seems like the leader like if you're the boss and you're trying to make like oh yeah
01:02:36.88 --> 01:02:41.36 I know everything and then like how you said they they find it you look way more stupid
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.12 like in the beginning it feels like he looks more stupid in the beginning I would think anyway
01:02:47.12 --> 01:02:53.52 like oh I'm the boss supposed to know all this stuff yeah I think the key point of that is way more stupid
01:02:53.52 --> 01:03:01.44 yeah you know what I look like that I don't think so in here you know I'm gonna go back to this
01:03:01.44 --> 01:03:12.000 other one three dinner guests living or dead and why three dinner guests living or dead
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:30.32 uh Mark Lee Mike Mansour Brian Joe how do you get the nickname jacco
01:03:33.92 --> 01:03:38.24 I answered this on Facebook live not fully though I didn't know fully
01:03:38.24 --> 01:03:44.56 uh anyways before I was born my dad wanted me to be a jacco my dad's name is John my dad's
01:03:44.56 --> 01:03:49.44 nickname is John no my dad wanted me to be a jacco my mom calls my dad
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.96 John no my dad said I hope he's a jacco my mom said a jacco
01:03:56.96 --> 01:04:01.52 she's a good dude I don't the yeah I don't think he said that whole thing
01:04:01.52 --> 01:04:09.44 you know that's the deal and then I'm actually when I said that my mom said actually my dad was
01:04:09.44 --> 01:04:17.36 nicknamed John oh not by her but by his family because he was named after his uncle
01:04:17.36 --> 01:04:24.48 whose name was John Obo Ford for something like that yeah so there you go yeah man it goes deep there you go
01:04:24.48 --> 01:04:34.48 no that question for jacco do you teach your wife about being strategic and how open
01:04:34.48 --> 01:04:44.40 is she to how open is she to having her husband be her teacher that's a good one that's a
01:04:44.40 --> 01:04:55.52 that's a good one for who for for for ruining my life it's a good one for me
01:05:06.40 --> 01:05:13.68 first of all let's assess this how many people just people and I'm talking spouses
01:05:13.68 --> 01:05:20.56 how many people are just super open to being taught like if I was like let me teach you a little
01:05:20.56 --> 01:05:25.68 something you're in mean like that's that already starts off in a bad footing because it
01:05:25.68 --> 01:05:32.32 implies that I know something you don't know I can help you you're inferior to me you lack
01:05:32.32 --> 01:05:44.000 the spring knowledge that I have clearly I must instruct you that's key to quiz right
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:56.96 it is offensive to my wife so do I sit around and you know trying teach my wife you know
01:05:56.96 --> 01:06:03.68 here's the deal here's the deal when we're dealing with our kids I absolutely do this now when
01:06:03.68 --> 01:06:10.16 I think about it you know I'll say to my wife hey listen oh the boys doing this and you're
01:06:10.16 --> 01:06:17.28 trying to do this don't do that all you're doing is you know it's oh he wants to get all crazy cool
01:06:17.28 --> 01:06:22.56 let's do this you're trying to combat I used to tell this when when the kids were really small
01:06:22.56 --> 01:06:32.48 because she's super nice and concerned and wants to make things right and wants to win arguments
01:06:33.92 --> 01:06:38.72 which when you're trying to win a logical argument with a four-year-old it doesn't work
01:06:38.72 --> 01:06:43.68 doesn't work and I say look you're arguing logic with a four-year-old so I think there's an appropriate
01:06:43.68 --> 01:06:49.76 time to do it you have to be careful that you're not trying to you know be the superior human
01:06:49.76 --> 01:06:58.56 yeah oh Mr. strategy want to teach me something about kids yeah so take it easy and all that being said
01:06:58.56 --> 01:07:07.68 I do have strategic conversations with my wife about the family team right like we're a business
01:07:07.68 --> 01:07:14.16 like your your house and your family is a business you have income you have expenditures you have
01:07:14.16 --> 01:07:19.20 long-term strategic goals so those kind of things we talk about and you know I'm the one that's sort
01:07:19.20 --> 01:07:23.28 of is usually saying hey what about this strategic goal what are you doing over here what do you
01:07:23.28 --> 01:07:31.04 want to do that so we have those conversations but not so much me saying how but me you know us
01:07:31.04 --> 01:07:40.24 figuring out what we're going together life this she ever like teach you how to be strategic in
01:07:40.24 --> 01:07:53.36 any way like be more sensitive or anything like that bro you serious no actually my the cool thing about
01:07:53.36 --> 01:08:04.88 my wife is she knows me really well and accepts those uphold deal she accepts the shortfall
01:08:04.88 --> 01:08:12.56 she knows that she got what she got she rolled a dice hey sorry yeah all right there you go
01:08:14.08 --> 01:08:19.84 next question can you share how someone that is introverted and has social anxiety can become a leader
01:08:22.88 --> 01:08:28.40 I mean first of all if you've got social anxiety you need to go through that exposure therapy
01:08:28.40 --> 01:08:34.88 which is what I wrote about in way the warrior kid that I didn't know I was writing about I didn't
01:08:34.88 --> 01:08:40.88 know as an actual psychological methodology until Jordan Peterson was explaining to me that well
01:08:40.88 --> 01:08:43.92 what you do is someone in the situations you give him small exposure it's like oh that's what
01:08:43.92 --> 01:08:49.04 happens in way the warrior kid you're smarter than I thought so you can do the same thing with this
01:08:49.04 --> 01:08:52.88 social anxiety you know you start talking from small groups you grow you get out hang out with
01:08:52.88 --> 01:08:57.60 people and you continue to do that until you get more comfortable so you can you can sort of over
01:08:57.60 --> 01:09:07.44 come that and it's the same thing with being introverted now there there are leaders that are
01:09:07.44 --> 01:09:15.76 more introverted but what you have to do is you have to bring people onto your team to complement
01:09:16.40 --> 01:09:24.72 that area where you're a little bit weak so if if you're a leader guess what you have to do you have
01:09:24.72 --> 01:09:28.96 to communicate to other human beings and sometimes you have to communicate to other human beings
01:09:28.96 --> 01:09:33.68 in large groups that's what happens that's what a leader does sure sometimes it can be on the
01:09:33.68 --> 01:09:38.40 phone sometimes it can be on email sometimes it can be in radio over the radio but there's times
01:09:38.40 --> 01:09:44.32 where you're going to have to communicate to the people that you're leading so if you're super introverted
01:09:44.32 --> 01:09:50.16 and uncomfortable with that and it's a challenge you're going to have to overcome that challenge yes
01:09:50.16 --> 01:09:58.08 you can get better at it through practice but some people are not going to ever get a really
01:09:58.08 --> 01:10:02.80 comfortable get some people are never going to get really comfortable talking in front of a group
01:10:03.68 --> 01:10:09.36 and so what what you do in that situation is you bring someone in your team that is really good at it
01:10:10.40 --> 01:10:16.48 and then when it's time to address the troops you you know you as the leader stand up and say
01:10:16.48 --> 01:10:22.56 here's the two things I'm worried about on this operation here's where we're heading and now
01:10:22.56 --> 01:10:28.08 Bill's going to brief you on the details of the plan and that's fine because Bill's allowed
01:10:28.08 --> 01:10:31.84 now if Bill's going to get up there and communicate really clearly and that's going to be great
01:10:31.84 --> 01:10:37.36 and you still gave enough as the figure head and as the leader of the organization that people
01:10:37.36 --> 01:10:41.92 go okay yep we heard from Jocco you know he put out the word he didn't say much
01:10:41.92 --> 01:10:46.80 doesn't even seem like he has to we we hear we's coming from so you just have to build a team
01:10:46.80 --> 01:10:51.52 that's going to compliment your weaknesses and you know generally if you're introverted well that
01:10:51.52 --> 01:10:56.56 means you're good at some other thing that that loudmouth isn't good at right the loudmouth is like
01:10:56.56 --> 01:11:01.76 who's going the front door kick it down and he doesn't have any sort of
01:11:03.52 --> 01:11:09.76 tactical sense of how to run an operation smoothly so you come up with a good plan and then you
01:11:09.76 --> 01:11:14.80 brief it's a bill loudmouth bill and then you say bill we're going to brief the troops and then
01:11:14.80 --> 01:11:19.84 you make it happen so you have to do a little bit of both you have to improve your personal skills
01:11:19.84 --> 01:11:25.68 which you can do through exposure and practice don't get up and talk about things that you don't
01:11:25.68 --> 01:11:30.80 know get up and talk about things that you do know that you're uncomfortable with and you practice
01:11:31.84 --> 01:11:35.76 and while you're practicing while you're getting better at that you also build a team where
01:11:35.76 --> 01:11:40.64 you compliment your own weaknesses and we all have leadership weaknesses and you got to build teams that
01:11:40.64 --> 01:11:45.92 can compliment that.
01:11:46.48 --> 01:11:48.16 A greedy.
01:11:49.52 --> 01:11:57.36 I'm glad. Next question. How can one guide or lead a leader above you especially when you're
01:11:57.36 --> 01:12:02.000 many links away on the chain of command or many links what down the chain of command?
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:12.80 Oh so you want to guide a leader that's far away from you in the chain of command?
01:12:13.68 --> 01:12:20.56 Yeah. Yeah. You got a build relationship with that person. That's what you got to do.
01:12:21.92 --> 01:12:27.44 In fact, leadership is about building trust and building relationships with people and trust
01:12:27.44 --> 01:12:32.24 is leadership and leadership is trust and relationships are trust and relationships are leadership.
01:12:32.24 --> 01:12:38.72 These are like the trifecta of becoming a good leader. You build trust with people. You build relationships.
01:12:39.52 --> 01:12:44.24 And in a situation like this, if I have no if you and I don't know each other very well
01:12:45.28 --> 01:12:48.40 and I come up to you and say hey I think you should do this. I mean what's your reaction?
01:12:49.04 --> 01:12:52.48 But if you just approach someone that you don't have a relationship with and then you start
01:12:52.48 --> 01:12:57.92 telling them how to run things that's offensive, that's offensive to like most human beings.
01:12:58.72 --> 01:13:03.52 I have to get to know you. I have to see what kind of approach is going to work for you.
01:13:04.40 --> 01:13:07.36 Because you might be the kind of person if I know you a little bit we like you know I'm really
01:13:07.36 --> 01:13:10.88 working on my leadership. What do you think I could do better? That's great. Then we open the door
01:13:10.88 --> 01:13:15.12 or we can move forward. You might be the kind of person that I have to flank. You might be the kind of
01:13:15.12 --> 01:13:21.76 person that you won't listen to me but I say oh you should channel this book that I read or
01:13:21.76 --> 01:13:29.36 whatever. There's ways to do it. But to look at a target and know how you're going to attack the
01:13:29.36 --> 01:13:33.84 target without knowing anything about it, without having any intelligence on it, that's not going
01:13:33.84 --> 01:13:39.60 to be effective. So we have to actually gather some intelligence about the target. We have to and
01:13:39.60 --> 01:13:44.16 the way we do that is by building a relationship with. By getting to know that person. Once you know
01:13:44.16 --> 01:13:53.60 the person, then you can start to infuse and shift and mold and sculpt and influence the way that
01:13:53.60 --> 01:14:03.76 they lead. You have to build that relationship to kick things off. Next question. I'm not in the
01:14:03.76 --> 01:14:09.44 military nor am I a firefighter or law enforcement. I'm an air traffic controller here in the
01:14:09.44 --> 01:14:15.36 New York area. And I found myself in several leadership positions without within our union.
01:14:17.04 --> 01:14:22.48 Since I read extreme ownership, I've tried to implement this and the ideals that come with it. Overall,
01:14:22.48 --> 01:14:28.88 I believe it's been a success and of course still a work in progress. Specifically, the communication
01:14:28.88 --> 01:14:34.64 aspect of ensuring our people know why are we doing, why are we are doing something and how it
01:14:34.64 --> 01:14:41.20 affects them as it has been the biggest influence and game changer in my opinion. Union typically
01:14:41.20 --> 01:14:49.20 come hand in hand with what about me attitudes and we definitely have that within our ranks. This
01:14:49.20 --> 01:14:54.16 is something I've been trying to tackle with both new air controllers, new controllers and
01:14:54.16 --> 01:15:00.48 older ones and I think I'm making headways slowly but surely. Thanks to you and life. My question
01:15:00.48 --> 01:15:06.56 is this, have you ever had direct experience dealing with unions and this particular mindset?
01:15:06.56 --> 01:15:13.36 Is there any advice you can have specific to labor unions that could make this more efficient?
01:15:13.36 --> 01:15:19.20 Yeah, well we work with businesses all the time and we certainly work with businesses that are involved
01:15:19.20 --> 01:15:24.72 with or that either are unionized or partially unionized and yeah this is something that
01:15:24.72 --> 01:15:31.20 can be very, very common and the reason it can become very, very common is because the union
01:15:33.36 --> 01:15:44.56 is an organization and the company, the corporate, the headquarters is a separate organization.
01:15:44.56 --> 01:15:53.12 And so what happens is as we let these two elements grow, they tend to grow apart and they tend
01:15:53.12 --> 01:16:00.08 to start looking out for themselves and that becomes problematic. It becomes problematic and any
01:16:00.08 --> 01:16:04.80 organization where you've got the union on one side and what the union starts looking out for is
01:16:04.80 --> 01:16:09.44 what's good for them and what corporate is looking out for, what headquarters looking out for is
01:16:09.44 --> 01:16:15.84 what's good for them and what happens is we stop talking to each other and what we fail to realize
01:16:15.84 --> 01:16:26.96 is that both those entities have a common goal, they have a common goal and the more we work
01:16:26.96 --> 01:16:38.48 together to achieve that common goal, the better off both entities will be. So what this boils
01:16:38.48 --> 01:16:43.84 down to and the where I would focus step number one in this this is a long fight this is a long
01:16:43.84 --> 01:16:51.44 war is trying to make sure that the union side because you're talking about from your position
01:16:51.44 --> 01:17:01.44 in the union, the union side understands how working with corporate headquarters, how working
01:17:01.44 --> 01:17:08.40 with them will benefit the individuals in the union in the long run. So and a great book to read
01:17:08.40 --> 01:17:15.60 about this is that book I mentioned earlier with Mulalee American icon and what he told the
01:17:15.60 --> 01:17:24.08 unions was hey listen I get it you want your hourly wage to be $76 an hour you want to take care of
01:17:24.08 --> 01:17:29.36 the union that's awesome let me tell you what's going to happen in 18 months if we keep paying that
01:17:30.32 --> 01:17:34.48 we're not going to have a company anymore here's the numbers here's how it's going to work
01:17:34.48 --> 01:17:42.32 and they lower down their hourly rate to $55 now that's a huge cut and you can imagine
01:17:42.88 --> 01:17:51.76 the union thinking that's we lost we lost but Mulalee did a great job of saying no we lose if we
01:17:51.76 --> 01:17:58.08 don't come together we lose if we don't try and achieve our actual mission the mission that
01:17:58.08 --> 01:18:06.56 we're all focused on which is making great cars and being a profitable company so same thing here
01:18:07.28 --> 01:18:13.52 make sure that the areas that overlap the common mission make sure that everyone understands how
01:18:13.52 --> 01:18:17.68 achieving the common mission benefits both parties
01:18:17.68 --> 01:18:24.88 to access
01:18:24.88 --> 01:18:30.96 I've been a police officer if you have some long questions for echo Charles
01:18:30.96 --> 01:18:35.60 I mean I'm trying he's been studying him for four hours
01:18:35.60 --> 01:18:42.88 I've been a police officer for about four years I consider myself to be proactive
01:18:42.88 --> 01:18:48.32 and try to get after it every day much like many of my brother and sister law enforcement officers
01:18:48.88 --> 01:18:55.36 recently I switched to a bigger agency with a bit of a different mission I still try to be as proactive
01:18:56.08 --> 01:19:02.48 and as thorough as I can in everything that I do but I've noticed that many of the front-line
01:19:02.48 --> 01:19:07.52 supervisors in this agency want officers to be reactive rather than proactive
01:19:07.52 --> 01:19:13.04 the supervisor in particular has told me to stop working so hard and get salty
01:19:16.40 --> 01:19:22.24 suggesting that I lower my morale the question is how do I build a relationship with these
01:19:22.24 --> 01:19:29.52 supervisors while still being proactive and working hard so this is what I did
01:19:29.52 --> 01:19:37.12 when I got to see a team one I was this guy right here I was fired up
01:19:39.44 --> 01:19:45.28 I was hey oh we're doing an obstacle course today cool I'm gonna wear my rock sack with a 40
01:19:45.28 --> 01:19:50.56 pound sandbag in it and all the guys that were older were you know looking at me like dude
01:19:50.56 --> 01:20:02.16 pump breaks and you know of course what did I think those guys are are of course those guys are weak
01:20:03.04 --> 01:20:07.28 that's what I was thinking and then you know I thought to myself okay
01:20:09.28 --> 01:20:14.64 how can I how can I have influence over them how can I have influence over the
01:20:14.64 --> 01:20:20.88 Paltoon that I'm in can I have influence over the Paltoon that I'm in if everyone that's in my
01:20:20.88 --> 01:20:32.32 Paltoon doesn't like me no can you if everyone in my Paltoon doesn't like me because I'm super hard core
01:20:34.08 --> 01:20:41.12 then are they gonna steer it all in my direction no the answer's no the answer's no
01:20:41.12 --> 01:20:46.24 in fact they're gonna isolate me in fact I'm gonna have no influence over my Paltoon
01:20:47.12 --> 01:20:52.64 and that's that's a horrible thing so what did I do did I just go okay cool I
01:20:52.64 --> 01:21:01.04 could look like donuts is the deal no I didn't do that at all but I conformed
01:21:02.64 --> 01:21:08.96 right I conformed and people think oh that's weak you should conform look
01:21:08.96 --> 01:21:17.20 you are not the priority you as an individual are not the priority in a simple tune
01:21:18.40 --> 01:21:25.36 you're not the the priority is the Paltoon the priority is the mission
01:21:26.56 --> 01:21:33.68 and if we're gonna execute a mission we need to be very tight as a team so if I put my
01:21:33.68 --> 01:21:42.08 personality above the unity of the team I'm hurting our capability of accomplishing the mission
01:21:42.64 --> 01:21:48.56 especially if I realize that guys need to train a little bit harder and instead of actually
01:21:48.56 --> 01:21:55.04 doing something that's gonna move them in that direction they reject me and now I'm outside
01:21:55.04 --> 01:22:00.72 the the brotherhood of the circle and now I haven't moved them in any right direction and also
01:22:00.72 --> 01:22:06.32 now there's one guy that's in really good shape me and everyone else is going in the other
01:22:06.32 --> 01:22:14.56 direction and I have no influence over them that that's just terrible the mission is the most
01:22:14.56 --> 01:22:20.64 important thing in order to most effectively execute the mission we have to have the best possible
01:22:20.64 --> 01:22:26.40 team in order to have the best possible team we have to have trust and relationships inside the team
01:22:26.40 --> 01:22:36.40 if I violate that I'm taking away from the team I'm taking away from our mission capability
01:22:36.64 --> 01:22:42.80 now of course if there's someone that's grossly out of shape or out of standards yeah
01:22:43.76 --> 01:22:48.96 I'm gonna I'm gonna try and tighten that person up but again if someone's completely out of
01:22:48.96 --> 01:22:54.80 standards and all I do is attack them what's their reaction it's it's to step away from me to
01:22:54.80 --> 01:23:00.96 reject me but if I say hey man you know I know you got a lot of experience and you know I'm 19
01:23:00.96 --> 01:23:06.88 and I just got a bud so I'm pretty good shape but like can can you teach me some of the
01:23:06.88 --> 01:23:12.96 tactics that you know and all of a sudden I'm building a relationship with them and then I say hey
01:23:14.72 --> 01:23:19.44 you want to go for a little a little job with me after work and you know that guy's done eight
01:23:19.44 --> 01:23:23.20 deployments and he's tired and he's old but he wants to be back in shape because we all want to be
01:23:23.20 --> 01:23:34.48 in shape and he goes okay a short one and we're moving in the right direction so that's what you
01:23:34.48 --> 01:23:41.20 need to do you have to you have to back off a little bit you have to find balance and you have to
01:23:41.20 --> 01:23:48.88 focus on the team and it's better to have the whole team it's better to have 20 people that move
01:23:48.88 --> 01:23:53.84 a little bit in the right direction then have one person by themselves that's going on the right
01:23:53.84 --> 01:24:00.24 direction and everyone else is going on the wrong direction so that's what you need to do take the
01:24:00.24 --> 01:24:06.48 sandbag out of your rucksack a little bit and you know I ran with jungle boots on I did all this stuff
01:24:06.48 --> 01:24:11.84 and it didn't take me very long to realize I was not doing the right thing not making my team
01:24:11.84 --> 01:24:20.96 stronger I was isolating myself and stopped it so this guy he should like what start acting just a
01:24:20.96 --> 01:24:31.60 little bit salty or you know lower his morale appearance a little bit like to kind of fit in
01:24:31.60 --> 01:24:38.72 so to speak yeah do you want to be part of the team yeah if you're not part of the team you don't
01:24:38.72 --> 01:24:44.08 have any influence if you don't have any influence you can't move the team in the right direction
01:24:44.08 --> 01:24:49.12 if you can't move the team in the right direction the team is less mission capable that's what you're
01:24:49.12 --> 01:24:55.84 therefore yeah is to make the team more mission capable every moment that you don't do that you're
01:24:55.84 --> 01:25:03.60 doing something wrong so yes you don't have to show up I mean just imagine I was a new guy at
01:25:03.60 --> 01:25:08.88 Seethy-Mon people we show up to run the O course the O course is the O course is a really hard Opsco course
01:25:09.52 --> 01:25:16.88 and I show up with a rucksack on with a 40 pound sandbag in it as a new guy you know of course
01:25:16.88 --> 01:25:26.64 got people like that's fired up but people were like okay oh you're you're 19 years old
01:25:26.64 --> 01:25:38.32 and you just got out of Buds yeah whatever mix we don't like you so it's kind of like steering
01:25:38.32 --> 01:25:43.28 like a big van right you can't just start making big turns with the big otherwise the things
01:25:43.28 --> 01:25:49.84 gonna pin a tip over a little bit soon saying no you gotta like you can't if you gotta
01:25:49.84 --> 01:25:58.48 you gotta go slow as well I'm saying okay you guys understand anyway next question sure
01:26:03.76 --> 01:26:09.20 apparently apparently the van thing was a yeah it was correct that's a some of you
01:26:09.20 --> 01:26:14.64 that didn't understand it until we understood it was correct yeah it's exactly same thing
01:26:14.64 --> 01:26:20.64 outstanding anyway my wife and I have four young boys ages between ages three and seven
01:26:20.64 --> 01:26:26.16 we're both running successful busy careers my question is how do you forge a meaningful
01:26:26.16 --> 01:26:31.36 connected relationship that instills discipline and leadership with your kids while balancing
01:26:31.36 --> 01:26:40.40 today's demanding 24-7 corporate environment here's a couple of things make time you have to make
01:26:40.40 --> 01:26:46.48 time you have to make time where you're not looking at your phone you're not looking at your emails
01:26:46.48 --> 01:26:52.08 you have to set a good example and and I think the most important thing here for kids aged three to
01:26:52.08 --> 01:26:59.84 seven you have to make sure that they understand that what you're what you're doing and why you're
01:26:59.84 --> 01:27:05.76 doing it they have to understand look you know this house we live in we have to pay money for this
01:27:05.76 --> 01:27:10.96 house that we live in you know the food that we we have to pay money for that and in order for us to
01:27:10.96 --> 01:27:16.88 have a secure future where we can still have a house and we can still have food we need to make sure
01:27:16.88 --> 01:27:22.24 that we have money for the future that's why mom and dad work so hard it doesn't mean that we
01:27:22.24 --> 01:27:26.72 wouldn't love to sit around and play with you guys all day we would love to do that and every
01:27:26.72 --> 01:27:32.48 chance we'd get we're gonna do it but we have to be able to pay for the things we have and we
01:27:32.48 --> 01:27:37.68 have to be able to pay for our future and that's why we're working so hard right now so we can have
01:27:37.68 --> 01:27:43.36 more freedom and more time with you in the future so they have to understand why you're doing what
01:27:43.36 --> 01:27:56.48 you're doing and I'll add this so do you so do you you have to assess why you are working
01:27:56.48 --> 01:28:03.44 so much that you're taking time away from your family if you're working so much and taking time
01:28:03.44 --> 01:28:11.92 away from your family so that you can get the Mercedes S class instead of the Lexus
01:28:13.68 --> 01:28:23.28 ask yourself is that why you're doing it and what has more value the S class or the dance recital
01:28:23.28 --> 01:28:33.84 keep yourself in check yeah makes sense to any kind of got to tell the truth to yourself
01:28:33.84 --> 01:28:40.32 because you know like you could answer the email later or add another time not dinner time or whatever
01:28:40.32 --> 01:28:46.08 you know you can a got to be truthful that's what I found anyway helps that's why you don't
01:28:46.08 --> 01:28:56.08 return my emails on time next question was there time during your service in the teams that stood
01:28:56.08 --> 01:29:00.96 out above the rest and would you mind sharing a brief story not before heard on your podcast
01:29:02.48 --> 01:29:06.24 well obviously the time in the teams was being in task in a bruiser being in the battle or
01:29:06.24 --> 01:29:14.72 moddy that's pretty straightforward something that I haven't I don't think I've talked about on the
01:29:14.72 --> 01:29:24.80 podcast but it it definitely is something that I remember very clearly and that is when
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:35.04 when seal team five came in to take over for us and so this was in October of 2006 and
01:29:35.04 --> 01:29:41.36 seal team five a task unit from seal team five came in to take over for us and we're doing the turn
01:29:41.36 --> 01:29:49.20 over with them meaning we're explaining to them the battle space and it takes a couple days for
01:29:49.20 --> 01:29:57.28 all of them to arrive they arrive in bits and pieces and so we're doing the turnover but once they were
01:29:57.28 --> 01:30:08.40 all there I did a turnover brief with them the whole group and as a matter of fact Marcus LaTrelle
01:30:08.40 --> 01:30:16.96 was in this group and this was after he had gone through what he'd gone through in him you know I just
01:30:16.96 --> 01:30:22.32 saw Marcus the other day and we were talking about this I couldn't believe he was in her body
01:30:22.32 --> 01:30:28.96 after what he'd went through and this was not long after there he was in her body as a
01:30:28.96 --> 01:30:37.84 platoon leading pedi officer and it was his group of guys and I remember one thing I just I just
01:30:37.84 --> 01:30:49.44 remember was looking at them and I was telling them you are going to take casualties and
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:58.32 that it's sort of like that thing you see in the movies or I've talked about it reddit and books
01:30:58.32 --> 01:31:04.48 about Vietnam where you had guys that were coming in country and they got new camouflage uniforms
01:31:04.48 --> 01:31:11.36 on and they're all clean cut and there's the guys that are getting ready to go home and
01:31:12.80 --> 01:31:21.04 those guys at that time seals deploying into a situation you seals deploying the situation
01:31:21.04 --> 01:31:25.36 there are kind of unknown at least up until this point it was like okay well we're going
01:31:25.36 --> 01:31:29.28 to do missions we don't know how bad it's going to be it might be bad it might not be that's
01:31:29.28 --> 01:31:34.000 sort of was the standard those guys that were coming into a body that relieved us from body
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:39.76 they knew and the senior enlisted guys are one of my very good friends those guys knew 100
01:31:39.76 --> 01:31:44.96 percent they went to Mike Montsource and then got on a plane and came over they knew 100 percent
01:31:44.96 --> 01:31:51.92 and so for me I won't forget looking at this group of guys that were about to start a six
01:31:51.92 --> 01:32:00.80 month appointment and telling them you are going to take casualties and that was just a blunt
01:32:00.80 --> 01:32:06.80 honest truth and they did take casualties they didn't lose anyone they had no one killed but they
01:32:06.80 --> 01:32:13.28 took some very very severe casualties and did a great job a great group of guys but
01:32:14.08 --> 01:32:16.24 that was a harsh reality to walk into for sure
01:32:16.24 --> 01:32:26.80 Roger I would do one more of these questions before the life questions will go live people
01:32:30.64 --> 01:32:42.40 what was your first combat mission and what was your role so 2003 I deployed to Baghdad as a
01:32:42.40 --> 01:32:51.92 seal-potent commander and the senior enlisted guy of my task unit was already in Baghdad
01:32:51.92 --> 01:32:59.92 waiting for us and this guy is an incredible guy just as a matter of fact his wife
01:33:01.44 --> 01:33:10.56 tells him and me that we're soulmates she jealous but anyways this guy just a incredible guy
01:33:10.56 --> 01:33:17.76 but he had been on the ground for a while and he'd done the push-up into Baghdad with the
01:33:17.76 --> 01:33:23.60 Marines and then he'd come home and then he was back over and so he was waiting for us and he was
01:33:23.60 --> 01:33:28.08 and was my opportunity we show up and I remember we hit the ground we I don't even know how long
01:33:28.08 --> 01:33:33.20 we'd been there but it wasn't long it might have been like the night we got there and
01:33:33.20 --> 01:33:42.64 there was moreder teams that were more green our base and they had been for a few days
01:33:43.84 --> 01:33:53.28 and so this guy a couple of mortars went I think anyways whatever happened he comes in like
01:33:53.28 --> 01:33:56.88 you're taking your guys out right now you gotta take your guys out and go and see if you can find
01:33:56.88 --> 01:34:08.16 you know where these things launched from and I was I was sort of not ready for that you know we
01:34:08.16 --> 01:34:13.04 been there for four hours you're taking your guys out and I'm you know what I said
01:34:13.04 --> 01:34:19.68 Roger that and you know I talked to him later like later that night he goes yeah let's just
01:34:19.68 --> 01:34:23.84 try to get you outside the wire and get some and I was like how about you give me a heads up next time
01:34:23.84 --> 01:34:29.68 so that was it I was just running that little vehicle thing and we went out look for bad guys we
01:34:29.68 --> 01:34:34.72 didn't find any and came home but that was the first kind of exposure outside the wire
01:34:34.72 --> 01:34:43.28 and back that not a very exciting story sorry there we go all right so we got some folks running
01:34:43.28 --> 01:34:51.12 around with microphones and does anyone have a is anyone having any questions okay let's see a
01:34:51.12 --> 01:34:55.84 couple hands anyways I'm gonna take this thing off so I can sort of move around and see you
01:34:55.84 --> 01:35:01.52 and our mic people I'll point to you and we'll find somebody all right let's go you right there
01:35:01.52 --> 01:35:06.80 black sweatshirt I was just trying to get him to call on me but he wouldn't wait until he took
01:35:06.80 --> 01:35:14.48 your order so you got a good team here so you were talking about childbearing before
01:35:14.48 --> 01:35:23.04 so not me personally but no you had to you were cornered um any thoughts about having a child
01:35:23.04 --> 01:35:30.56 free-ring book come out like a team childbearing book you mean how to raise kids well yeah
01:35:32.32 --> 01:35:41.04 childbearing yeah um I mean maybe not maybe this is a bad idea no no no I'll tell you what
01:35:41.04 --> 01:35:46.48 there I wrote a couple books one's called Way The Warrior Kid and one one's called Marks Mission
01:35:46.48 --> 01:35:52.40 I read them okay yeah I mean the the amount of people that have come back to me and said like
01:35:53.44 --> 01:36:00.80 as a dad as a mom thank you for writing this book because every time I read it I've learned now
01:36:01.76 --> 01:36:07.84 that means that I'm basically saying hey you need to learn you need to pull
01:36:07.84 --> 01:36:14.96 parts of the lessons out of here so perhaps I could be making more straightforward and also
01:36:16.80 --> 01:36:22.24 hey as I'm though perfect parent by any stretch but one thing that's good about putting the
01:36:22.24 --> 01:36:27.28 ideas on paper is I would start to clarify things myself and you start looking at I would start
01:36:27.28 --> 01:36:32.16 looking at mistakes that I made and say okay here's a clear mistake I didn't really recognize it
01:36:32.16 --> 01:36:37.68 before but now that I'm detached I'm looking back at it so yeah not a bad idea yeah fine
01:36:37.68 --> 01:36:42.16 answer is everything just how to discuss with your kids like all of these things are really
01:36:42.16 --> 01:36:48.000 important topics and I think the extreme ownership perspective could be a great addition awesome
01:36:48.64 --> 01:36:54.08 thank you all by you question over here you
01:36:56.56 --> 01:37:02.56 he's leaving it I like to come prepared good evening jockel good evening
01:37:02.56 --> 01:37:13.04 what lesson do you wish you'd have learned earlier in life that you now know
01:37:17.20 --> 01:37:23.36 it is disciplinical freedom I mean that is the thing that that when I connected that together
01:37:23.36 --> 01:37:30.24 in my head that that the fact that that applies to absolutely everything that's the biggest lesson
01:37:30.24 --> 01:37:36.32 that I wish I would have learned earlier in life and if I would have figured that out then
01:37:37.84 --> 01:37:41.28 I would have been doing a lot better and I would have done a lot better and I would have been a lot
01:37:41.28 --> 01:37:48.16 better of a person the thing that I try to tell kids I try to tell them that for sure the other
01:37:48.16 --> 01:37:55.04 thing that I think kids miss is kids and I miss is something that I completely missed as a kid
01:37:55.04 --> 01:38:03.28 the actions that you take now affect your future that sounds so obvious but when you're 14
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:10.40 you just think no nothing I you know my life is only another 20 minutes so what I'm doing right now
01:38:10.40 --> 01:38:14.72 doesn't really matter so when I talk to kids I try and explain to them the discipline
01:38:14.72 --> 01:38:18.72 of freedom and then I try to explain to them that what you're doing right now
01:38:18.72 --> 01:38:24.64 really will have an impact to where you are in the future and I don't know if you listen to that
01:38:25.68 --> 01:38:30.32 podcast that I did the Warrior Kid podcast that I did number 19 about my friend Jeff
01:38:31.52 --> 01:38:38.32 and I talked about it on the adult podcast as well but you know it's a classic story I had a
01:38:38.32 --> 01:38:44.64 best friend when I was little and we separated friendship not we were still friends but we
01:38:44.64 --> 01:38:49.12 drifted apart he started getting into partying and getting into drugs and all that and I
01:38:49.12 --> 01:38:56.32 didn't and his trajectory in life just went down and I joined the Navy which was great and it
01:38:56.32 --> 01:39:02.96 put me on a good path almost involuntarily but he ended up he ended up killing himself
01:39:03.68 --> 01:39:08.64 and you know it was drugs and it was alcohol and it was just bad but while I was going through
01:39:08.64 --> 01:39:13.68 buds he killed himself and what I tried to explain to the kids on the Warrior Kid podcast is like
01:39:13.68 --> 01:39:21.20 the decisions that the little decisions that you make they matter they add up and you have to
01:39:21.20 --> 01:39:25.44 connect those dots otherwise you don't know where you're going to end up and it might be bad
01:39:28.32 --> 01:39:36.96 cool got your hand up quick bro good job I doing hi doing jacco so first I want to say thank you
01:39:36.96 --> 01:39:43.44 for being here and continuing to inspire us all I really appreciate it so little backstory I'm
01:39:43.44 --> 01:39:47.92 currently a detective and a police department in New Jersey and sitting number one on the
01:39:47.92 --> 01:39:54.56 sergeant's list looking to get promoted about marcher April so my question is I'm going to be
01:39:54.56 --> 01:40:00.40 the youngest sergeant in the department and not with a lot of experience now I've never had an issue
01:40:00.40 --> 01:40:07.36 into the department doing pretty well and as soon as that list came out and I was number one
01:40:07.36 --> 01:40:13.92 detention just rose I mean look at this kid less than five years on the job you know in his
01:40:13.92 --> 01:40:20.08 twenties and they already want to see me fail before I even got to the position so I'm trying
01:40:20.08 --> 01:40:27.36 to mentally prepare myself in that role when I already know that it's coming against me so what's
01:40:27.36 --> 01:40:32.96 your best advice for someone that is going to be you know in this position of see I was looking
01:40:32.96 --> 01:40:38.16 every position as a leadership position but now structurally I'm going to be their supervisor
01:40:38.16 --> 01:40:44.72 so what's your best advice to to me going into that situation yeah this is the same exact situation
01:40:44.72 --> 01:40:50.08 that military officers get put into military officers in the seal themes in the Marine Corps and
01:40:50.08 --> 01:40:56.08 the army and the navy your kid that comes out of college you have zero experience and you get
01:40:56.08 --> 01:41:01.68 put in charge of a department on a ship or you get put in charge of a puttune and all the sudden
01:41:01.68 --> 01:41:07.36 you're a guy with zero experience and you got a puttune chief that's been in for 16 years that's
01:41:07.36 --> 01:41:13.68 that's the way it works and so I've had to have this conversation over and over again and what we're
01:41:13.68 --> 01:41:19.92 going to do is number one we're not going to act like we know everything even if you do know more even
01:41:19.92 --> 01:41:24.24 if you have things more figured out than these guys if you go in there and act like it guess what they're
01:41:24.24 --> 01:41:29.84 going to do they're going to reject you who is this young whipper snapper young buck thinks he knows
01:41:29.84 --> 01:41:33.12 everything he doesn't know about this he doesn't know about that they'll sabotage you to make
01:41:33.12 --> 01:41:38.000 you look bad but if you go in there in your humble I'm not talking about being a pushover
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:44.16 I'm not talking about being weak but I'm going to lean towards being humble I'm going to lean
01:41:44.16 --> 01:41:49.84 towards listening to what they have to say I'm going to lean towards saying hey you know I've never
01:41:49.84 --> 01:41:54.24 handled a case like this before you have any perspective you can help me out with this instead of
01:41:54.24 --> 01:41:59.12 hey this case is mine let me show you how it's going to be that right there you're taking a relationship
01:41:59.12 --> 01:42:04.08 in a negative direction we want to we want to we want to build a team and we want them to we want
01:42:04.08 --> 01:42:09.28 to get their respect how do we how do we get their respect we get we actually get respect
01:42:09.28 --> 01:42:17.52 this crazy sound we get respect by by being humble so if echo if echo is working for me I show
01:42:17.52 --> 01:42:21.12 up he's more experienced than me and I show up and I say all right here's what we're doing here's how
01:42:21.12 --> 01:42:26.88 we're doing this mission here's how it's going to be my way and I think he knows what's up now
01:42:26.88 --> 01:42:35.36 he knows he's on the boss what's he actually thinking who's this idiot that's had the job for
01:42:35.36 --> 01:42:40.88 three days and he thinks he's going to tell me what to do and he's going to he's going to resist it
01:42:40.88 --> 01:42:45.28 he's going to sabotage he's going to and we're going to have a bad relationship but if I come
01:42:45.28 --> 01:42:50.000 in and say hey echo really great to meet you you know I'm just checking in here I was looking
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.64 at your I was checking out your your record you've been here for a long time man you really nailed

01:43:28.24 --> 01:43:32.96 if he comes up with a plan and I think I have a better plan but he's got a plan that's
01:43:32.96 --> 01:43:39.52 that's pretty solid who's plan am I going to pick I'm going to pick his plan I'm not going to force
01:43:39.52 --> 01:43:46.24 my plan down his throat it makes our relationship go backwards it makes him think that he needs to
01:43:46.24 --> 01:43:50.000 compete with me I don't want to go up the echo this is your plan you come up with it you make it happen
01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:58.80 echo always jokes me he's like I know you do this stuff to me and he's like and it still works
01:44:00.88 --> 01:44:07.04 and I do you know I do it's like hey if he can come up with a plan I would rather we execute his plan
01:44:07.04 --> 01:44:15.20 because then he cares more about it it is so stay humble listen work hard
01:44:15.20 --> 01:44:21.44 get pretty cheap thanks for your service brother thank you front row shot it up quick right here
01:44:24.24 --> 01:44:30.24 you got that thing up quick a game first fall juggle thank you for being out here
01:44:30.24 --> 01:44:34.16 in New York it's great to finally see you live I just want to give you respect to your
01:44:34.16 --> 01:44:38.000 reliability elaborated some on communicating as a family you said you're going to put some
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:43.84 work on set out regarding that stuff hold on second bro my hearing's not great slow down hit
01:44:43.84 --> 01:44:50.88 it with me again all right quick and simple a top three rules on raising kids from ages three to
01:44:51.68 --> 01:44:56.16 nine really getting that sort of attitude and still while they're still young so not about the
01:44:56.16 --> 01:45:02.80 family like dynamic not about managing just the kids attitude yeah it's with kids first of all you
01:45:02.80 --> 01:45:10.88 got to remember this is the hardest thing for parents to deal with is your kid is not going to be
01:45:10.88 --> 01:45:18.40 who you want them to be they're just not they're humans and they have their if that was the
01:45:18.40 --> 01:45:24.24 truth all of my kids would be the same type of kid and they would all you know you could just
01:45:24.24 --> 01:45:29.28 here's what they all do they're not they're not your kids are going to be different and your
01:45:29.28 --> 01:45:32.72 kids are going to be different from you they might be a little bit better than you at some things they
01:45:32.72 --> 01:45:38.08 might be worse than you do other things so what you have to do is first of all get that idea out of
01:45:38.08 --> 01:45:46.56 your head that being said you can definitely provide guidance and you can definitely put
01:45:47.76 --> 01:45:55.92 them in guide them in the right direction but what you don't want to do is make every decision
01:45:55.92 --> 01:46:01.52 for them what you don't want to do is only let them do what you tell them to do they've got
01:46:01.52 --> 01:46:05.28 to learn to make decisions otherwise they can't go into the world and defend for themselves
01:46:05.28 --> 01:46:09.36 they've got a suffer consequences of their bad decisions otherwise they can't defend for themselves
01:46:09.36 --> 01:46:16.40 in the world so you have to set this before you have to you have to like let them brush up
01:46:16.40 --> 01:46:19.84 against the guardrails of failure you have to let them tie their on you you have to let them spill
01:46:19.84 --> 01:46:32.000 the milk and the more you make or allow them to do for themselves the better human beings they're
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:40.72 going to be the more that you do for them and force on them and impose on them the less they're
01:46:40.72 --> 01:46:48.000 going to know for themselves and the more they're going to rebel against the values that you're
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:52.80 putting forth to them again it's a dichotomy and I'm not saying hey like your kids do whatever
01:46:52.80 --> 01:46:58.48 whatever they want when they go outside that box is given a nice pick box when they go outside of
01:46:58.48 --> 01:47:02.24 that you've got to bring them back in and you've got to explain to them why you're bringing them back in
01:47:02.64 --> 01:47:08.24 they got to understand that there's the reason they're not allowed to play in this area is because
01:47:08.24 --> 01:47:14.08 there's bad people there or there's danger there it's not just because I said so so you develop
01:47:14.08 --> 01:47:20.72 these relationships with your kid you guide them but you don't direct them and you let them
01:47:20.72 --> 01:47:28.96 be as much of a leader as they can be and that's the best thing you can do for them.
01:47:28.96 --> 01:47:35.60 Thank you can I add one more thing to to that which actually jockel opened my eyes to this and it like
01:47:37.12 --> 01:47:42.24 like your kids are always watching you like always what so if you're yelling at mom or yelling
01:47:42.24 --> 01:47:47.12 that people on the phone or I don't know doing stuff you're doing stuff that you don't want them to
01:47:47.12 --> 01:47:51.60 do you can say hey don't do this they'll be like cool but once they kind of get the opportunity they're
01:47:51.60 --> 01:47:56.80 like I guess this is kind of how because that does it especially with the yelling thing and
01:47:56.80 --> 01:48:02.24 losing like how do you do it stress and stuff that's brother they'll jump right on that that's what
01:48:02.24 --> 01:48:06.88 I really noticed when actually when he opened my eyes to it I was like ah okay you know when
01:48:06.88 --> 01:48:14.32 you know sometimes you get kids or your kids how many kids you have oh okay all right
01:48:14.32 --> 01:48:19.36 well you're planning ahead okay all right there you go keep this in mind then because a lot of the
01:48:19.36 --> 01:48:24.88 terms you're like all your three year old or you be like dang where did they how did they pick that up
01:48:24.88 --> 01:48:30.56 I didn't teach him that and the thing is you probably will have taught him that just by doing it on
01:48:30.56 --> 01:48:36.32 your own you know yeah so they're always watching you so that helped me I think a lot
01:48:36.32 --> 01:48:46.80 tight to kids but tighten your game up a little bit around the kids let's see really tall hand
01:48:46.80 --> 01:48:55.36 back there you thank you so a very specific example then my son he's three I would love for
01:48:55.36 --> 01:49:00.56 him to get into Brazilian jujitsu just like me which I also got into thanks to you two gentlemen thank
01:49:00.56 --> 01:49:07.84 you very much so how do I encourage him without pushing him without you know just getting him
01:49:07.84 --> 01:49:15.84 into it really you have to make it fun you have to make it fun and it is much better for it to
01:49:15.84 --> 01:49:23.20 be fun once a week then for them to hate it three times a week the kid that hates it three times
01:49:23.20 --> 01:49:27.20 a week and you think I'm doing it my favorite I'm doing her a favorite because I got her in their
01:49:27.20 --> 01:49:38.48 web she likes it or not she's three years old bro the best possible thing you can do is not make
01:49:38.48 --> 01:49:46.88 them train jujitsu right now it's make them enjoy jujitsu right now I did not do this well with my kids
01:49:47.76 --> 01:49:54.40 I didn't it's horrible when my when my especially my daughters my daughter when they were very young
01:49:54.40 --> 01:49:59.28 it was jujitsu jujitsu jujitsu we were doing they were doing jujitsu six days a week
01:50:05.68 --> 01:50:13.12 they were like six and that was that was that was part of it let me tell you what I did
01:50:13.12 --> 01:50:19.44 that's worse what what's worse is I was like okay you're also going to compete because
01:50:19.44 --> 01:50:25.68 competing makes you better and it gets worse because then it was oh when I take you to compete
01:50:25.68 --> 01:50:32.72 since I'm the coach I'm going to put you in a higher weight class I'm going to put you against
01:50:33.84 --> 01:50:41.04 older kids and you know what if you lose look if you lose it doesn't matter because you're
01:50:41.04 --> 01:50:46.48 going to be tougher so so just go out there do your best if you lose don't worry about it's
01:50:46.48 --> 01:50:52.64 going to make you tougher so my daughters go to compete in jujitsu tournament jujitsu tournament
01:50:52.64 --> 01:50:58.08 what happens to them they get beat they get beat by someone that's older they get beat by someone
01:50:58.08 --> 01:51:09.76 that's heavier is that fun that sucks what do I think what is idiot think oh you're getting tougher
01:51:09.76 --> 01:51:16.64 and so by the time they were 10 it was like I don't want to do any of this crap anymore and
01:51:18.64 --> 01:51:24.000 it got to a point when I was like okay look this is ridiculous I realized the mistake that I
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:31.44 made and I just had to back off and luckily my son made it through that time period where he
01:51:31.44 --> 01:51:38.24 he kept training all the time and became very good at jujitsu and wrestling but
01:51:38.24 --> 01:51:48.08 with the girls I I didn't do it right so find a good school where the jujitsu is fun
01:51:48.80 --> 01:51:52.56 don't force it down there throw it let me tell you one more really quick story my son had a friend
01:51:53.60 --> 01:51:59.92 who was like you know his run in me and when he was six years old I said yeah we'll bring
01:51:59.92 --> 01:52:03.84 your son to jujitsu let him try it he tried it at six years old he didn't like he tried it one time
01:52:03.84 --> 01:52:10.80 I'm like it got chill in the crime he tried it at age seven hey we tried it again didn't like it
01:52:10.80 --> 01:52:16.16 hated it tried it at age eight didn't like it hated it age nine has dad trained his dad
01:52:16.16 --> 01:52:21.12 had started training his he kind of got to look at like oh that's pretty cool by the time he was
01:52:21.12 --> 01:52:27.84 nine and he tried it he liked it and he liked it because he liked it and he was then old enough
01:52:27.84 --> 01:52:32.48 to make the decision want to train and started training hard and he got good really quick
01:52:32.48 --> 01:52:38.16 it it wasn't like oh he missed those four years of training they didn't make a big difference
01:52:38.16 --> 01:52:44.88 is my point they don't make a big difference so the most important thing you can do as a parent
01:52:44.88 --> 01:52:53.60 is make it fun for your kids make working out fun make jujitsu fun make school fun make these things
01:52:53.60 --> 01:52:58.32 enjoyable make let them win you know put them in positions where they're gonna win and I'm not
01:52:58.32 --> 01:53:03.76 saying every time because you do have to learn how to lose let them learn to lose when they occasionally
01:53:03.76 --> 01:53:11.68 let them learn to lose when they get a loulder but make it fun for them that's the key
01:53:13.28 --> 01:53:19.44 I'm gonna eventually get balcony up there but I guess ju in the back go
01:53:19.44 --> 01:53:26.56 jaco my questions on the other end of the spectrum for the police officer I'm a battalion chief in
01:53:26.56 --> 01:53:34.24 the fire department 28 years on the department how do I relate to the 19 year old can you really
01:53:34.24 --> 01:53:41.84 a story that you worked with a 19 year old new seal and you're trying to get what to happen I
01:53:41.84 --> 01:53:46.64 wanted to develop that relationship with them you talked about the relationship above me as a
01:53:46.64 --> 01:53:53.60 leader how do I develop that relationship for the newer people below me the best way okay when we
01:53:53.60 --> 01:53:57.60 start talking about relationships and I I mentioned this earlier what a relationship is as a relationship
01:53:57.60 --> 01:54:02.32 is trust and that's what a team is a team is a bunch of people the relationship that all trust each
01:54:02.32 --> 01:54:08.56 other how do I develop trust with someone that's below me in the chain of command what I did this is
01:54:08.56 --> 01:54:13.84 what I did to make this happen as a platoon commander as a task unit commander as I was in charge
01:54:13.84 --> 01:54:21.36 of training is those young guys that are coming in I gave them responsibility I put them in leadership
01:54:21.36 --> 01:54:26.000 positions I remember the first time I took over a platoon with a platoon commander got fired
01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:32.32 and we had a training operation that night and I said I said a platoon chief I said hey who's like a
01:54:33.04 --> 01:54:37.52 a square away jute really junior guy and he gave me a name and I said okay he's gonna run this mission
01:54:37.52 --> 01:54:42.80 tonight and the platoon is like whoa wait what are you talking about this kid's gonna run the mission yep
01:54:42.80 --> 01:54:50.96 and all of a sudden what's the kid thinking wow this guy trusts me to do this I'm gonna do a
01:54:50.96 --> 01:54:59.68 good job for him and since he trusts me I'm starting to trust him and the more you do that the
01:54:59.68 --> 01:55:04.64 more you push down that responsibility and you let people lead and you put trust into them the
01:55:04.64 --> 01:55:12.000 more they're gonna trust you as long as when something does go wrong you don't chop their head off
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.96 when something does go wrong you say hey look let's let's take a look at it let's see we can learn
01:55:16.96 --> 01:55:20.88 from it and you know what probably my fault because I didn't give you very good guidance
01:55:21.76 --> 01:55:25.44 so let's learn from it and we'll try it again you know what you're gonna run the same
01:55:25.44 --> 01:55:31.20 mission tomorrow night I know you can do this that's how you build that trust up that's how you build a team
01:55:31.20 --> 01:55:39.60 hand came up quick right there it's amazing that you can tell the one pointing out
01:55:43.44 --> 01:55:46.48 jaco echo thank you for everything that he's given us
01:55:48.32 --> 01:55:56.96 acknowledging that we all have secrets jaco what would you need to see happen that would change
01:55:56.96 --> 01:56:07.12 your mind about a run at public office what let me finish what would be that sugar event to make you say
01:56:07.68 --> 01:56:11.60 okay public office stand by to get some
01:56:11.60 --> 01:56:27.44 I'll finish when sake white frankly you have a nation of troopers both foreign and domestic
01:56:27.44 --> 01:56:32.64 that believe and know that you're qualified to lead and ready to lend their support
01:56:32.64 --> 01:56:49.12 um what would it take there is a line somewhere there is a line somewhere where where I would
01:56:49.12 --> 01:57:01.84 feel like okay the you know the country needs me it's it's a pretty distant line it's it's
01:57:01.84 --> 01:57:20.08 that world is so I don't want to use the word corrupt but but but because that's not what I'm talking
01:57:20.08 --> 01:57:24.24 I'm not talking about like that kind of corruption and there's corruption for sure but you know you
01:57:24.24 --> 01:57:30.32 compare the corruption that we have to the rest of the world and it's very nice but there's a different
01:57:30.32 --> 01:57:39.20 word that I can't quite capture there's there's dishonesty there's I don't mind the chaos
01:57:39.20 --> 01:57:58.80 um some selfishness um here's what it is I think in order I like I like when things go wrong
01:58:00.64 --> 01:58:07.60 I know that sounds crazy but one of my biggest problems is that I get when things are going
01:58:07.60 --> 01:58:13.60 good I get really bored pretty quickly and I just like oh yeah that's cool oh we hey the business
01:58:13.60 --> 01:58:16.96 is doing this like my business like hey we're doing this and I'm like oh that's awesome we're
01:58:16.96 --> 01:58:22.08 going right there we're cool what can I look at next like I get I get kind of bored when things are
01:58:22.08 --> 01:58:32.80 going well and when things are going bad I love it I really like when things are going bad and so
01:58:32.80 --> 01:58:42.56 in the government things don't get that bad and for me to put my time and effort towards
01:58:42.56 --> 01:58:47.84 something all that you know it's really focused I would get bored very quickly because you know
01:58:47.84 --> 01:58:54.80 to be like hey you know what we're not doing too bad and so until there's something bad
01:58:55.68 --> 01:59:01.92 that I feel like okay it's time that's kind of what would would make me roll in that direction
01:59:01.92 --> 01:59:09.36 it seems like a miserable life to me it seems like a miserable life it seems like a life where
01:59:09.36 --> 01:59:15.92 you're constantly putting up a facade and I don't have the desire to do that you know I never
01:59:15.92 --> 01:59:22.56 got interested in going into the CIA or anything like that because I never wanted to live
01:59:22.56 --> 01:59:26.56 that kind of life and it does I'm not saying it's bad I mean the guys work with them and they're
01:59:26.56 --> 01:59:32.72 awesome but it's just not me and I don't like to live that way and it seems like there's a lot of that
01:59:33.92 --> 01:59:40.48 except the fact that if we got into a position as a nation where things were really bad and we needed
01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:50.56 some we needed to take action then I feel like I would step into it but man I hope we don't get
01:59:50.56 --> 01:59:55.12 there let me put you that way I hope we don't get there and I don't think we will but I appreciate
01:59:55.12 --> 02:00:08.80 that's not porch and I'm sorry red jacket first off thank you for everything you do and then
02:00:08.80 --> 02:00:12.72 my question is who are your role models growing up and like what qualities do they have
02:00:12.72 --> 02:00:24.64 well my first legitimate role models that I looked at instead okay that's a person that I can emulate
02:00:24.64 --> 02:00:30.88 that was when I got to the seal teams up to that point I was looking I was a confused kid that was
02:00:30.88 --> 02:00:36.08 looking at this you know this person and that person but I didn't really but even though even I
02:00:36.08 --> 02:00:39.92 wasn't confused enough to be like all I'm going to be like that person and follow what they're doing
02:00:39.92 --> 02:00:44.32 I would look at people like that seems pretty cool that seems pretty cool and so it wasn't till I got
02:00:44.32 --> 02:00:49.52 into the seal teams and there were some people that you instantly when I checked into the seal team
02:00:49.52 --> 02:00:54.80 one I'm like that guy's awesome I'm gonna that person right there is awesome I'm gonna do my
02:00:54.80 --> 02:01:01.44 best to emulate that person and there was probably five or seven people at seal team one when I got
02:01:01.44 --> 02:01:09.20 there that I stole as much as I could in terms of how to behave and and that was it you know
02:01:09.20 --> 02:01:14.88 a guy named Master G faculty who was super just ultra professional and everything and I was like
02:01:14.88 --> 02:01:21.60 he's so professional no one can say anything to him he's a professional like I'm going to
02:01:21.60 --> 02:01:27.28 I'm going to be like that there was a couple other there was other guys that unfortunately
02:01:27.28 --> 02:01:33.20 Master G faculty died so I'm using his name but other guys that I just looked at and said wow that
02:01:33.20 --> 02:01:40.24 guy's awesome so I didn't really have like those kind of role models until I got to the teams you know
02:01:43.28 --> 02:01:51.04 okay balcony is there anyone on the balcony microphone style right there up in the cheap seats
02:01:51.04 --> 02:02:04.000 Jaco echo thank you for your podcast Jaco thank you for the work that you you work with Jaco
02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:08.56 and didn't podcast also thank you to the men and women of the service president's future in past
02:02:10.08 --> 02:02:16.32 I come from a corporate environment working doing IT support now my recent role was where I was
02:02:16.32 --> 02:02:22.96 responsible for supporting 40 to 80 people pretty much solo and with that I had a manager remote
02:02:22.96 --> 02:02:27.20 you know I had a good work in relationship with him he's former military so he would tell me do
02:02:27.20 --> 02:02:32.24 certain things within the environment which I would do but then his manager would come down and visit
02:02:32.88 --> 02:02:39.84 and sometimes give me contradicting situations or orders so what do you do when you have your
02:02:39.84 --> 02:02:44.72 boss telling you one thing his boss your boss direct response report telling you do something
02:02:44.72 --> 02:02:50.72 contradictory yep the pretty straightforward if my boss's boss comes to me and tells me to do
02:02:50.72 --> 02:02:54.80 something I'm like hey I just want to make sure that you know that this is what I've been told to do
02:02:54.80 --> 02:02:59.60 and then they say yeah I don't care what that guy says and you go okay Roger that and then he leaves
02:02:59.60 --> 02:03:05.44 you go hey direct boss here's what's going on boss came down and told me to do this I'm here
02:03:05.44 --> 02:03:10.56 I work for you you're my boss and I want to tell you what's going on do you want me to proceed
02:03:10.56 --> 02:03:17.20 or do you want me to stop I want to keep you informed here's why I want to I want to do the right
02:03:17.20 --> 02:03:24.16 thing and this is what's going on so just take the information from the boss the the boss is boss
02:03:24.88 --> 02:03:31.52 got it have you told you know my boss that nope don't care okay you don't care fine hey boss
02:03:32.40 --> 02:03:36.88 your boss is telling me to do this I want to let you know it's going on it's obviously a
02:03:36.88 --> 02:03:43.12 a tenuous situation because then this guy up above the higher guy in the chain of command
02:03:43.12 --> 02:03:47.68 I'm like oh this you didn't do what I told you to do hey look I'm just trying to make sure everyone's
02:03:47.68 --> 02:03:53.84 informed and and that's the way that's the way things run smoothest if everyone's informed I'm
02:03:53.84 --> 02:03:59.84 here to support can you guys talk to each other so I know what I'm supposed to be doing down here
02:03:59.84 --> 02:04:07.44 you you got to kind of be the person that that connects the dots here to the best of your ability
02:04:09.20 --> 02:04:14.72 no problem all right let's say you're in an organization and you really want to see it succeed
02:04:14.72 --> 02:04:22.08 but it's being led by someone who is not only steering it in the wrong direction they're doing it deliberately
02:04:22.08 --> 02:04:26.80 and you're not really sure if you can negotiate with them what would your course
02:04:26.80 --> 02:04:33.36 my course of action if there's someone above me in the chain of command that's steering us in the wrong
02:04:33.36 --> 02:04:38.24 direction I'm going to do my best to influence and persuade them if I can't do that I'm going to do
02:04:38.24 --> 02:04:43.04 the best to mitigate the risk down the chain of command and the strategic risk I'm going to do my best to
02:04:43.04 --> 02:04:50.40 mitigate it and while I'm doing that I'm going to try and inform the other people around that person
02:04:50.40 --> 02:04:57.44 of the situation that's going on I'm going to build relationships with the CEO with the CEO with the
02:04:57.44 --> 02:05:03.52 CEO with the CEO you're talking about or if it's the batissio whoever it is I'm going to build some
02:05:03.52 --> 02:05:08.64 relationships with other people so we can get that person under control the other thing we have to
02:05:08.64 --> 02:05:16.08 remember is sometimes at the bottom we don't understand what the real strategy is and so my first
02:05:16.08 --> 02:05:20.40 thing is like hey boss can you explain to me why we're doing this because I it doesn't seem right to me
02:05:20.40 --> 02:05:24.48 for the following reasons I want to be able to support what you're saying can you tell me why we're doing it
02:05:24.48 --> 02:05:28.88 this way so sometimes they say oh yeah it's because of this I should explain that sometimes they say
02:05:28.88 --> 02:05:33.52 wait a second what do you mean my strategy is not working down on the front lines they don't know
02:05:33.52 --> 02:05:40.80 no one's telling them so you have to communicate with them to make sure that that they understand
02:05:40.80 --> 02:05:44.08 to make sure that you understand what direction you're supposed to be heading and to make sure that
02:05:44.08 --> 02:05:49.20 they understand why it's problematic on the front lines if all of that fails and they're just
02:05:49.20 --> 02:05:53.44 looking the telling you to be quiet and they're moving forward in something that's going to
02:05:53.44 --> 02:05:57.76 really be detrimental to the organization we got to start trying to figure out how to flank that
02:05:57.76 --> 02:06:04.56 person and and building a a alliances with people that can try and get us going in the right way
02:06:05.60 --> 02:06:11.36 thank you and of course there's you know there's situations where you know especially in the
02:06:11.36 --> 02:06:15.52 business environment like if you're in a ship and the ship is sinking and you've sounded the
02:06:15.52 --> 02:06:21.04 alarm and you've tried to you've tried to plug the holes and you've told everyone and they're still
02:06:21.04 --> 02:06:25.20 just staying on board the sinking ship without making any corrections there are times we got to
02:06:25.20 --> 02:06:32.24 go you know what this ship is sinking and I'm not going to stay on it that can happen we can't you can't
02:06:32.24 --> 02:06:37.76 save every sinking ship you can't and you got to know when it's time to go okay I'm going to take the
02:06:37.76 --> 02:06:46.80 lessons learned I'm going to go somewhere else thank you yes first I want to thank you because I am a
02:06:46.80 --> 02:06:53.84 stage four cancer survivor and
02:06:53.84 --> 02:07:08.32 and in my darkest hours that a lot of people can't comprehend you were there with me your voice
02:07:08.32 --> 02:07:15.68 your everything still to this day I mean this planet equals freedom is a common phrase in my family
02:07:15.68 --> 02:07:20.96 over the most monumental to the most ridiculous things like letting the dog out at the same time you know
02:07:20.96 --> 02:07:28.72 so I want to thank you for that with that being said I have at one point planned my own funeral
02:07:28.72 --> 02:07:34.72 didn't think I was going to be here for my kids you know the worst part of anybody's dreams you
02:07:34.72 --> 02:07:41.20 know nightmares and then to be at the place where I am right now and not knowing obviously I'm
02:07:41.20 --> 02:07:48.000 young and you know what the future holds the nobody's naive how you've been in those similar positions
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:54.88 just not health wise but you know facing death and everything else how do you switch from that
02:07:54.88 --> 02:08:01.12 mindset of like you said when things are going really bad I'm freaking awesome like I kick ass like I
02:08:01.12 --> 02:08:07.28 really do and then when things are kind of calm I'm like what do I do now like how am I going to
02:08:07.28 --> 02:08:11.20 you know even when you were just saying like your last line sometimes I think like you just speak to me it's
02:08:11.20 --> 02:08:20.48 so creepy that like my last cameo was Friday I shouldn't be well today but I am because I knew I
02:08:20.48 --> 02:08:34.96 had to be here you know so it's like stuff like that and then when you said that you know at the end
02:08:34.96 --> 02:08:40.48 of your podcast that you know I'm going to live life I'm going to live my days how did you get from that
02:08:40.48 --> 02:08:45.60 transition from you know possibly I don't know if I'm going to come out of this battle I don't know
02:08:45.60 --> 02:08:52.000 if I'm going to come home to okay I'm here life speaking great let's party and then in between like
02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:59.20 did you have any like how did you do how did you get from the darkest places to the brightest places
02:08:59.20 --> 02:09:04.40 and then bring everything my problem is is I want to bring I've learned my lesson like I've
02:09:04.40 --> 02:09:11.60 learned what I had to have learned now and now to bring it forward with me but not to let it define me
02:09:11.60 --> 02:09:24.64 if that makes sense for me and and I actually gave this answer to Sam Harris because Sam Harris said to me
02:09:24.64 --> 02:09:35.52 you know Joko you you you you talk about combat as your fondest memories and it you know the
02:09:35.52 --> 02:09:40.000 the best thing that's happened in your life it's the hype on your life which is all true and he said but
02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:51.44 then you talk about war being awful so which one is it and I said to him I said have you ever known
02:09:51.44 --> 02:10:01.36 anyone that has had cancer terminal cancer and made it through have you ever known anyone that that's
02:10:01.36 --> 02:10:10.96 happened to and he's like yes and I said when you talk to them many times they say I'm glad that this
02:10:10.96 --> 02:10:18.96 happened to me number one because it proved I could take it number two it's better me than one of my
02:10:18.96 --> 02:10:32.08 kids and number three now that I know how dark he can get I truly appreciate the light in the world
02:10:34.88 --> 02:10:44.16 that's what combat is and was for me that's what it was it was dark and horrible and I wouldn't
02:10:44.16 --> 02:10:54.64 wish on anyone just like you wouldn't wish cancer on anyone but if I can give them a little
02:10:54.64 --> 02:11:02.88 knowledge a little bit of a glimpse into what it is just like when you stand up here people
02:11:02.88 --> 02:11:09.84 clap when you said that people are clapping because they get to see a little bit of it and they go home
02:11:09.84 --> 02:11:20.72 tonight and they think what about that girl what about that girl she's fighting she's living
02:11:23.28 --> 02:11:25.84 and I'm gonna live too
02:11:25.84 --> 02:11:38.48 maybe that's why I had to have cancer that's how I look at things now I don't pretend to have the cognitive
02:11:38.48 --> 02:11:50.72 capacity to comprehend the mysteries of the world but maybe you're right and maybe you're here
02:11:50.72 --> 02:12:00.80 to let us know that it can get dark but it will get light again absolutely and thank you
02:12:01.60 --> 02:12:07.04 awesome
02:12:09.44 --> 02:12:13.68 awesome
02:12:13.68 --> 02:12:21.44 yes
02:12:21.44 --> 02:12:28.16 hey Jaco thanks for being here I've been in the army for three years now and for the past year I've
02:12:28.16 --> 02:12:34.16 been thinking about putting in a packet for special forces selection so I guess I just wanted
02:12:34.16 --> 02:12:40.40 to ask you to talk a little bit about when you joined the seal teams and what did you do to
02:12:40.40 --> 02:12:46.24 physically and mentally prepare yourself and generally why did you why did you decide to join
02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.44 man I wanted to do that since I was a little kid when I heard that this I heard that the seals
02:12:53.44 --> 02:13:01.44 was the toughest training and that's not the necessarily true thing all the training is hard there's
02:13:01.44 --> 02:13:08.64 the special forces the the marsawc units the raiders the air force PJs and CCCs it it
02:13:08.64 --> 02:13:14.48 it's everyone's got their awesome special operations units and the training is all hard and
02:13:14.48 --> 02:13:17.44 all for when I heard the seals the toughest training is okay that's what I want to do
02:13:18.16 --> 02:13:22.72 what do you do to get ready for you know what you got to do to get ready for you know army
02:13:22.72 --> 02:13:25.76 guess what you're going to be humpin' a rock you're going to be doing force marches you got to be
02:13:25.76 --> 02:13:29.76 over the run you got to build a nav you got to be able to do push ups and pull ups and and dips
02:13:29.76 --> 02:13:34.72 and rope crimes and offscores that's what you got to do you got to train hard you got to train
02:13:34.72 --> 02:13:42.16 as hard as you possibly can and then you have to tell yourself that you're not going to quit no
02:13:42.16 --> 02:13:51.76 matter what happens no matter what happens you're not going to quit no matter what happens
02:13:52.32 --> 02:13:56.24 because they're going to play a little psychological games on you like like let's say they go
02:13:56.24 --> 02:14:00.24 all he's in good shape he's you know we can't really touch him physically he's in really good shape
02:14:00.24 --> 02:14:04.96 so now you know what they're going to do they're going to say oh you know you failed this academic test
02:14:06.32 --> 02:14:10.16 you're not smart you're not really smart enough I mean you seem like a good guy but you're not
02:14:10.16 --> 02:14:13.36 really smart enough you're the kind of you're the kind of person that will get someone killed
02:14:13.36 --> 02:14:17.92 you're going to make a mistake you're going to start attacking you psychologically or if you're
02:14:17.92 --> 02:14:21.68 psychologically strong but you're physically weak they're going to be like hey you're the kind of
02:14:21.68 --> 02:14:31.36 person that won't be on the carry me out combat we don't want you they're just saying that don't quit
02:14:33.76 --> 02:14:45.12 that's it don't quit go get some all right um
02:14:45.12 --> 02:14:52.16 thank one more yeah we're looking I want to have some time to hang out sign books we got to be out
02:14:52.16 --> 02:15:00.56 here by 11 so we're getting close go ahead man front row
02:15:05.28 --> 02:15:10.24 Jacko thank you for speaking tonight just a quick question I've I work in a corporation here in
02:15:10.24 --> 02:15:15.28 New York and one of the toughest things with being an analyst here is just the fact of like when you actually
02:15:15.28 --> 02:15:20.40 escalate or you know which which kind of feels like defeat but also at the same time you want to
02:15:20.40 --> 02:15:24.80 make sure you live in somebody else to know what's going on so just want to ask you about that thank you
02:15:29.04 --> 02:15:34.64 for me I look at a problem if I think I can contain the problem then I'm going to try and
02:15:34.64 --> 02:15:41.60 contain the problem I recognize and I weigh the risk of if this is wrong what's going to happen
02:15:42.16 --> 02:15:48.40 can I manage that can I control it can I absorb the impact of that if I can't absorb the impact of it
02:15:48.40 --> 02:15:52.16 then I know it's like okay this I need to bring this up I need to send this up the chain of
02:15:52.16 --> 02:15:56.64 care if it's something that I know I can absorb the impact of and I can explain myself and it will be
02:15:56.64 --> 02:16:04.88 sense that won't have been a strategic loss or a major error then I'm going to try and hang onto it and in
02:16:04.88 --> 02:16:10.16 the beginning I'm going to be I'm going to air towards sending it up the chain of command as I
02:16:10.16 --> 02:16:16.32 start to trust myself and I get better at my job I'm going to hang on to more but again I'm always
02:16:16.32 --> 02:16:23.36 going to weigh is this something that I can contain or I can absorb if it goes wrong and if it's
02:16:23.36 --> 02:16:29.44 something that I can hey I'm going to run up by somebody so I think it's you just got to weigh that out
02:16:29.44 --> 02:16:38.96 and once you weigh that out make it a decision and live with it all right go one more
02:16:38.96 --> 02:16:50.96 here microphone anyone is there a mic right there
02:16:50.96 --> 02:17:04.000 somebody who's recently recently proposed to somebody would like to spend the rest of my life with
02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:12.16 somebody who's married and has from my knowledge gone away for extensive periods of time
02:17:12.96 --> 02:17:20.56 from the partner what is your tips to building a mortar proof marriage that's going to last
02:17:20.56 --> 02:17:28.40 a long time yep the first thing I'll say is you know you want to develop the you want you
02:17:28.40 --> 02:17:38.72 you want to make sure and encourage your wife to be emotionally independent emotionally independent
02:17:38.72 --> 02:17:45.04 because there's going to be times when you're not around and if they're dependent on you emotionally
02:17:45.04 --> 02:17:49.84 you're not there they're going to they're going to be hurt and they're not going to be able to
02:17:49.84 --> 02:17:57.60 handle it so you want to help them build that resiliency where when you're not around they know
02:17:57.60 --> 02:18:02.56 how to handle things independently like the broken water heater in the flat tire they can do that
02:18:03.20 --> 02:18:09.36 and you you go through those things you you build that confidence with them and then also
02:18:09.36 --> 02:18:16.48 the emotional independence where what they have is trusting you that you're gone but you're coming
02:18:16.48 --> 02:18:24.72 back and you're going to be there for them always that's number one number two is
02:18:26.32 --> 02:18:34.80 straight up extreme ownership that's what it is when something is going wrong in your marriage
02:18:34.80 --> 02:18:43.44 it's your fault it's your fault the minute you turned your wife and you say you shouldn't
02:18:43.44 --> 02:18:48.72 done this you're wrong and you're you're taking that relationship in the wrong direction
02:18:48.72 --> 02:18:55.20 when you say hey look I'm trying to figure out how I made you do what you did I don't want to let
02:18:55.20 --> 02:19:03.12 that happen so taking ownership when things go wrong that's what you've got to do that's what you
02:19:03.12 --> 02:19:24.80 got to do thank you awesome awesome and with that once again I can't thank you all enough for
02:19:25.60 --> 02:19:30.000 coming tonight and I know that you're just not here tonight I know that if you're here tonight
02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:36.08 you're here all the time you're with us you're supporting us you're supporting everything that we're
02:19:36.08 --> 02:19:43.44 doing you're supporting the you're representing representing representing with the store with the
02:19:43.44 --> 02:19:48.72 jockel store with the with the origin you you guys are in the game you're getting the books and and
02:19:48.72 --> 02:20:01.20 most important you're you're listening and you're with us and the podcast it's it's a lot of work
02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:12.24 it's a lot of work a lot of work goes into it but I get more out of it than anyone
02:20:12.24 --> 02:20:20.88 I get more out of doing this than anyone and the thing that drives me to keep doing this
02:20:22.40 --> 02:20:34.08 is not just what I get out of it but also that you all are there and that you all are listening
02:20:34.08 --> 02:20:41.04 and that you all are sitting there with us and that you guys are here in the same thing that I'm
02:20:41.04 --> 02:20:54.000 hearing and you're learning the same things that I'm learning and I know that we're together
02:20:56.24 --> 02:21:02.64 and I know that that sounds kind of weird that sounds kind of crazy but
02:21:02.64 --> 02:21:19.68 we are we are together we're hanging out we're moving forward and together we're stronger
02:21:19.68 --> 02:21:34.48 and even though we aren't strong enough to bring back days and even though we are strong enough
02:21:34.48 --> 02:21:54.48 to bring back the sunset at least we can sit here together and we can be humbled and
02:21:54.48 --> 02:22:12.40 mystified by this life and together we can go out and we can live it I think that's
02:22:13.52 --> 02:22:19.44 all we've got for tonight so thanks for coming down and until next time
02:22:19.44 --> 02:22:24.16 this is echo and jockel.
