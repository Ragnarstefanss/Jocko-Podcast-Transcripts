but if people in the group start saying you know what I'm not going to cover I'm going to run and now no one's covering and now you've got a bunch of people that are moving and no cover and that's when you're going to get slaughtered not only get slaughtered by people that are shooting at you but if you're not putting down cover fire the enemy maneuvers they don't just sit there I mean some of them will be shooting but they'll be shooting but other elements of them are going to move and they're going to be able to cut you off. Well, anything like, even like a, like a wasp or you know, like with these little things that are way smaller than you. yeah, when you grow up with that stuff, like those lizards are not scary, even if they're aggressive and some of them, they get pretty like big and bulky and they're like dang, a thing has some power to it, this little lizard, you know? Somebody just sent it to me and I gave it the little tests, what I kind of opened books up because people saw me a lot of books and I gave it the test, you know, I opened up by read a couple of sections and it immediately, you know, I'll give all open to a book in four or five different places to see what it reads like. And so it was like maybe two, three days later, I was like, well, I got to try that's the, you know, like, the 72 pound one. Do like, yeah, they're like, oh, you know, they're like, oh, wait, wait, no, grab it. And so you got to find someone like that that's in your team that you can say, man, this is this horrible, this is going wrong and someone's going to go, hey, you know, it's not that bad. And after a while, I was like, wait, I felt the same thing that you, you know, one time I told you, like, you're strong. I didn't look into like what exactly, you know, they're going to improve, but I know course strength and all this stuff, but there's all these little things they improve too. I don't know, you know, but then I just looked at the one that was like, it was like the first one I saw. They're actually walking down train tracks and they know 100% they know 100% that Germans are waiting for them and they're going to push down the strax and the way they're going to find the Germans is when the Germans start shooting at them. Pretty amazing book that, you know, like I said, I got this book six days ago or something. They've got basically ambushed and now they pulled back after, like I said, confirming where the Germans were back to the book to accomplish this, meaning to accomplish finding out where the Germans were to accomplish this had cost us Leslie Doyle and the absent Barfall Mill, while two men and Doyle's leading section were dead and the two scouts were missing probably either killed or made prisoner. Like, like the Jim Carrey, like, oh, yeah. Like, you don't know what that looks like until you get reading this book But when he calms down after I don't know, three, four minutes, you do that and he'll kill, keep kind of like, how do you lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen he'll always do that though, but he'll just be a lot less aggressive. Because I got this 90 pound one and I was like, I lifted it up and you know, okay, you know, this, the one hand boom, clean, what do you clean press? It was like when I was like testing like what website provider whatever. When all the men were recovered, and when you look at the actual battalion of the 156 pairs, you battalion, it looked like this, 313 men were captured, many of those were wounded. It's kind of like, you know, like an MMA fighter or something. And I think it's pretty clear that if you read a book like this, General Powell is still a source of inspiration as are the rest of these incredibly brave men and also a source of leadership lessons of what to do and what not to do, and it's also an incredible reminder of that heavy burden of command. Where if you would like, like, how you said in the book, just kept your head, you smash that lizard. Also, good way to support if you're going to get this book men at how do you pronounce good the place? And a lot of times I've found if you have someone like that or maybe a couple people like that and your team that you can talk to will guess what? So if I were to tell you, you're strong, it'd be kind of like, I like rebut, yeah. But, man, you definitely this book, like I said, I read, I don't know, 5% of it. Finally he walks it like more close to her and she kind of starts to turn around and he's like, oh, so now you pay attention. You know, when they know like that's your company. Further in these houses and for the first time you're going to hear the company commander start to realize he's got people at the breaking point back to the book. Because the, the field manual, like any field manual, like when you want to go refer to it, you don't want to be searching around.
