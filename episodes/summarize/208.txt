and I want something that's kind of like these and got a response back from this team in Montana that was basically trolling the internet for work because in 2009 the economy was not in a good place so you have to put yourself into those kinds of perspectives you know you like to say good about a lot of stuff you know bad stuff happens good And you know, this is one of the reasons that, you know, I've got my kind of personal mentor who have never met before, but Colonel David Hacworth, who came out at the end of the Vietnam war and said, you know, if we don't change the way we're fighting, we're going to lose. So I was thinking, I didn't really know, but I thought I would do something in business or consulting or I had these, you know, these, it's a really tough state to be in when you're in your early 20s and you're going to college or you're trying to figure out your life and you don't know where it's going to go. And so there were some startup costs to this though, you know, traveling around and, you know, the events were 12 and then 14 hours and, you know, they were really, really challenging and every single time it was like a little fight club that happened. and then when did that develop into or how long was business school so business school was from 2009 to 2011 and so even business school is I applied to a couple schools and it's like I don't even know if I want to go to business school I mean that it's like it's so weird to think about now I've got these chapters in my life I'm applying for more stuff trying to do something I mean the idea of filling out an application to go to grad school was just a hugely daunting task this should take you know two or three hours it was months in decisiveness in inability to function and you know we talk about military transitions are hard like whoever you are if you lose all of your support structures everyone's got a break in point. And, and, and so then by the time it really started to, to pick up by the time we got to the hospital with our, or with our, or rackies, and, you know, we got our Humbies and they got their pickup trucks and there's, you know, It's, how many Humbies would you guys have in a 12-man team? So even when I hear a plane hit the, you know, one of the twin towers, I'm like, oh, Sessna, you know, pilot doesn't know what he's doing. and so you know didn't know anything about manufacturing didn't know anything about anything but eventually was like You know, people are always looking for kind of this sound, a good sound by a good clickbait, title, for an article, but someone asked me something along the lines of, like, what was the moment that all this leadership stuff came, like, we came clear to you. Like this every time I see like a person in the tropics, looking at fish, they're in, they're a little fin, yeah, and they're just like, you know, no idea. And then, you know, she's in West Africa and I'm in Iraq and then I'm in Colorado and it's, you know, you're, we're, a mediums were the thing back then, you know, these sort of, because it wasn't as simple as everyone's got data connections just pull up FaceTime or Skype or whatever the case may be. And I mean, when the Marine Corps pushed into nausea, you know, three, it was, you know, like a legitimate war battle going on. I guess I'll try to figure out how to design a backpack or a rucksack and thankfully I actually unbeknownst to me almost knew a lot about this topic that I just sort of gravitated toward it because I knew a lot about it even though I didn't have some conversation that said I really know about rocking and rucksack I was not my own id boosting my own you know sense of self worth through something that I thought would be a great way to spend time it was just something to do You know, like, you know, I was like an E4 in the teams. And if people don't understand that, you know, I get asked sometimes you, well, I don't know what my next mission is, I don't know what to focus on. Like you have certain dates and you have to re-enlist prior or you do all these things and, you know, they were really trying to keep guys in because they had invested a lot in us and, you know, the mission wasn't stopping. And yet, you know, when I have these kind of, these times when I think and reflect, usually outside with a ruck on, like, am I doing what I can do to make my community, my family, my community, my country stronger, because I just, I feel like I owe, and that's the, the bug that I caught through, through service. You know, this is important because, and you know, they had just, they were dive, they were dive guys within SF, which is just, it's just another suck school that you go to down in Key West, and it's a real suck school, not gentlemen's course at all, and you're already a greenbrain, you go do that, and then you join a dive team, and it's just another sort of notch, right, that you have. Because for me, it's, it's got nothing to do at this point about, oh, well, you know, the specifics of, well, a career or however many years in army and it's got everything to do about the way of life that I want to lead, that I want others to lead with me, which is based upon the time that I spent in special forces. And it sort of made the rounds and the people that did it, they told the people that they thought, I know, because when you're done, you say, I know just the person that needs to do this, right? You're not on, you know, it's kind of like kind of like standing on the dang cables at airborne school. I mean, and then on the officer side is like, well, you know, you're going to, if you go in as an officer, you're going to obviously be put in charge earlier. Yeah, because like once again, I'm picturing these girls playing your mom and you know, they're worried if there's, there's some distraction over on the side is like a camera going off. And this is where this was the beginning of my life turning into that bad country song where a guy's got his dog and you know, his sort of bottle of whiskey and all of his sorrows and you know, I ended up only being in Africa for about two months. If you, if the rock sack was like stream lined, I don't know like how, but I mean, they get, there's varying levels of bulk. and it's hard to relate to myself now in some of those chapters it's like when I think about deploying to war and all the training that I went through and the people that I served with it feels like I'm reading my own book sometimes right my own kind of narrative in my head And you know, I mean, it was just a really, it was just a really hard time, you know, it's, and it's also hard when you're fighting and my, my family was hugely supportive. But he posted like he just got, I don't know, like an entire palette of dac savage to his house. And then, you know, she's got a second layer of, quote, security and it's a renocop basically and they've got a stick, you know, they're not doing anything with that stick, but it's, it's faux security. And he says, and you know, it's a hard job being a bocens mate because you're doing all this kind of work of, you know, bloating vehicles, unloading vehicles, loading boats, unloading boats, you're in charge of making sure that the equipment is maintained. And this is something else that people ask me, you know, oh, should I do this now or I got a good job offer, but I really want to be in the military or I want to go to college, but I went over there. And it, it, it sort of just felt like this guillotine that I was facing as I, you know, because it's not like you just show up one day So you know there were a couple, you know, hey, I had to learn how to make sure they locked arms when the serve was coming, right? Well, it was like, you know, so we talk a lot about PTSD and all that stuff this day and age and it's become this kind of thing where every veteran probably has it. and I know all the right people through through Emily, which you know, because I'm her dependent now. yeah, this is, did you leave on hey, this is probably not going to work or did you leave on like, okay, well, I'm going to go figure some stuff out in America, she's going to stay. And so that means just, I mean, we have seals, green berets, delta guys, we have, you know, PJs from the, the air, we have all, you know, we have forced reconnaissance Marines. You know, you start to activate the intelligence networks that, you know, other guys on our team had been developing throughout that time. And there's no doubt expectations that family and loved ones, they have for what your life should be, you know, the perfect life like Edward Norton in Fight Club, right? So you guys need to go to a place like Hawaii or, you know, the Bahamas, you guys keep going random African nations that are in turmoil. I think what you're doing well and what I'm glad that you already figured out is like you're focused on helping people out and you're exposing them to, I don't know if I want to call it a form of exercise because it's really a lot more than that. So drive back, you know, second year she's going through, she's working out of the, the Langley and then, you know, out of, out of the farm. And he had been on, you know, so just to put some of her work and perspective, you know, she's going as 110-pound girl out to go on termination meetings with assets. well look the economy was in a really bad spot good good if you're looking for work good if you're trying to do something awesome because there's a lot more opportunity whereas when nobody's looking for work and everything's really expensive and you can't find any deals because the economy is just purring forward it's harder you got to you got to speed things up faster so anyway found this great team out there and basically worked on the rocks and how to do them throughout my first year in business school Just the way that they face, I mean, Travis Mills, I don't know if you know Travis Mills is I mean, it kind of makes sense if you look at it practically because if you're going to be in a situation where the weather and the temperature is this thing, you're not going to be like, yeah, But it's like, you know, like that you could, you could isolate that as a work. And so, you know, part of what going through elite style of training brings is the confidence to know when not to pull the trigger. You know, and, you know, she fell in love, got remarried and had Natalie, who is just the world's greatest big sister. and so it's like, you know, she's like, hey, I'm done. You know, like if you're not mortally aware of what's going on, there's probably something not quite right.
