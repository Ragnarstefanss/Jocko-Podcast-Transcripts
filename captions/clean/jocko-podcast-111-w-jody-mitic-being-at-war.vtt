00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.84
This is Jocco podcast number 11 with echo Charles and me jocco willink good evening echo

2
00:00:10.92 --> 00:00:12.92
So

3
00:00:12.92 --> 00:00:15.92
Almost two years ago

4
00:00:15.92 --> 00:00:20.20
I had a guy on the podcast by the name of

5
00:00:20.44 --> 00:00:23.28
Jodie Middick and we ended up talking

6
00:00:23.28 --> 00:00:31.04
For so long that we actually turned one podcast into two podcasts the first one was a review of his book

7
00:00:31.04 --> 00:00:35.96
Which had just come out was called unflinching the making of a Canadian sniper

8
00:00:35.96 --> 00:00:44.84
And then we did a second podcast right after that that was just us talking and discussing some more of the details

9
00:00:46.12 --> 00:00:50.04
Of where had his life had gone since that book had come out and

10
00:00:50.04 --> 00:00:53.04
And those podcasts are

11
00:00:53.52 --> 00:01:00.72
Number 24 and number 25 and if you haven't listened to those yet just stop here go back and listen to them first

12
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And in those podcasts

13
00:01:04.38 --> 00:01:12.48
We discussed jodies early life and how he ended up in the military and his sniper training in his two deployments to Afghanistan and

14
00:01:12.72 --> 00:01:15.12
The events of January 11th

15
00:01:15.32 --> 00:01:18.32
2007 when during an operation

16
00:01:18.32 --> 00:01:20.32
He

17
00:01:20.32 --> 00:01:22.32
it'll land mine and

18
00:01:23.44 --> 00:01:26.96
Lost both of his legs below the knee and

19
00:01:29.40 --> 00:01:31.40
From there

20
00:01:31.84 --> 00:01:34.48
He struggled to stay alive

21
00:01:35.60 --> 00:01:39.04
But he did and he made it back to Canada

22
00:01:39.44 --> 00:01:45.84
Where he then struggled to recover from his injuries and then he struggled to adapt to his new life and along the way

23
00:01:45.84 --> 00:01:49.92
He struggled to overcome addiction to pain medications that had been

24
00:01:50.88 --> 00:01:52.88
Given to him so freely

25
00:01:54.60 --> 00:01:56.60
But he did

26
00:01:57.12 --> 00:01:59.12
overcome those struggles and

27
00:01:59.36 --> 00:02:06.60
Made a new life and wrote a book and got elected as a member of the city council of the city of Ottawa

28
00:02:07.76 --> 00:02:13.48
And he continued to raise his young girls and take care of them and by all accounts

29
00:02:13.48 --> 00:02:17.000
We're talking about a model citizen in fact

30
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I'd go so far as to say a model human being

31
00:02:25.12 --> 00:02:27.12
But

32
00:02:27.96 --> 00:02:30.60
Things aren't always as they appear

33
00:02:32.60 --> 00:02:39.24
And although jodie looked to be doing great by any measure behind that public persona

34
00:02:39.24 --> 00:02:41.24
The

35
00:02:41.96 --> 00:02:43.96
struggle continued

36
00:02:45.24 --> 00:02:54.24
And I saw glimpse of it when jodie came down to be on the podcast I first noticed it when I made reservations for jodie at a hotel by my house

37
00:02:55.24 --> 00:03:02.16
And I just got a nice little hotel nearby me so I could pick him up easy and didn't think much of it

38
00:03:03.36 --> 00:03:04.36
I

39
00:03:04.36 --> 00:03:13.000
Even the hotel information in a couple days later he called me up and said he needed to transfer to a different hotel because the hotel that I had made reservations at didn't have

40
00:03:13.72 --> 00:03:14.68
handicap

41
00:03:14.68 --> 00:03:16.68
Accessible rooms

42
00:03:17.96 --> 00:03:20.68
And of course I felt like a like a jerk

43
00:03:22.04 --> 00:03:27.24
But at the same time I didn't really understand because I'd seen all these video clips of jodie

44
00:03:27.96 --> 00:03:32.28
Walking around and and actually running around and he'd gotten

45
00:03:32.28 --> 00:03:40.44
Second place in this TV show called the amazing race where he's doing all these different challenges and I saw pictures of him and videos of him

46
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.40
running and driving cars and and even

47
00:03:44.76 --> 00:03:47.000
Writing motorcycles driving motorcycles

48
00:03:48.92 --> 00:03:52.92
So clearly there was something that I didn't understand that was going on and

49
00:03:54.28 --> 00:03:58.84
Maybe he wasn't as mobile as I thought he was and when I went to pick him up at the airport

50
00:03:58.84 --> 00:04:00.84
I wasn't really sure what to expect

51
00:04:00.84 --> 00:04:02.12
I

52
00:04:02.12 --> 00:04:05.88
Know if he's going to be a wheel chair. I don't know if he's going to need help getting around and as I drove

53
00:04:06.60 --> 00:04:08.92
Through the pickup area looking for me wasn't hard to spot

54
00:04:10.04 --> 00:04:17.48
He was standing at the curb big beasts over six feet tall and he walked over the car with confidence

55
00:04:18.76 --> 00:04:22.92
When we really zero indication that he was walking on to prosthetic legs and

56
00:04:24.20 --> 00:04:27.96
You know, so we recorded the podcast after after noon and it took forever

57
00:04:27.96 --> 00:04:32.52
It was like five hours or six hours and then we got done with that and we went grab steak and

58
00:04:34.04 --> 00:04:37.72
And the next day, you know, he said hey can you give me a tour of San Diego?

59
00:04:37.72 --> 00:04:43.16
Can you show me you know some of the sights around here and so we did that and I took him down to the

60
00:04:43.64 --> 00:04:47.64
The buds compound where the seal training is and then I took him to the seal teams and

61
00:04:47.64 --> 00:04:57.64
We went to the USS midway the aircraft carrier museum and we're walking all over that and and then he wanted to go down to the beach town where I live in so we we walked around there

62
00:04:58.12 --> 00:05:04.12
And it was awesome and he was enjoying it being down from the cold frozen tundra of Canada

63
00:05:05.48 --> 00:05:12.20
And as we got towards the end of the day, you know, Jody started walking a little bit slower and and I noticed on his face he had

64
00:05:12.20 --> 00:05:19.80
A look of discomfort, right that he was you could see was trying not to really reveal it but it was there and then

65
00:05:19.80 --> 00:05:26.04
And then finally said he you know can we can we sit down for a minute these things start to hurt after a while and he's pointing down at his legs and I

66
00:05:26.04 --> 00:05:29.72
Said of course, yeah, no problem man. So he sat down for a little while and

67
00:05:30.68 --> 00:05:36.12
He recovered a little bit and then we got up and we walked a little bit more and then he said hey man can we sit down again

68
00:05:37.40 --> 00:05:38.68
And I said yeah, man, of course

69
00:05:38.68 --> 00:05:46.28
So then we sat down for a little while and then when he got up again he said hey, could we just head back to your house and maybe sit or sit around there for a little while these things are

70
00:05:46.68 --> 00:05:49.80
They're starting hurt pretty good right now, you know the the skin wears off

71
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And it starts to bleed and you know, it's

72
00:05:53.80 --> 00:05:56.84
Doesn't feel good man and I said yeah, but I don't know problem

73
00:05:57.88 --> 00:06:02.04
So we headed back to my house and and we went up on the deck and we sat there and

74
00:06:02.04 --> 00:06:09.08
Just kind of hung out talked and and it became clear to me

75
00:06:10.92 --> 00:06:13.88
Something that I did know from

76
00:06:14.92 --> 00:06:18.52
My other friends that have been wounded badly that

77
00:06:19.80 --> 00:06:21.80
It's a lot harder than it looks

78
00:06:22.44 --> 00:06:24.44
It isn't the bionic man

79
00:06:25.80 --> 00:06:27.80
And it's hard to adapt the

80
00:06:27.80 --> 00:06:29.80
the

81
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Intermingling of human flesh with mechanical parts is not a natural thing. It's not a smooth thing. It's a battle

82
00:06:39.08 --> 00:06:42.68
And it's a battle that's hard for us to perceive

83
00:06:43.72 --> 00:06:50.28
From the outside, but it's a battle that takes place every minute of every day usually behind the scenes

84
00:06:52.44 --> 00:06:54.44
privately

85
00:06:54.44 --> 00:06:56.44
because

86
00:06:58.36 --> 00:07:00.36
As soldiers as

87
00:07:01.16 --> 00:07:02.36
Marines

88
00:07:02.36 --> 00:07:06.20
These men learn to suffer and bear their burdens

89
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
silently

90
00:07:09.72 --> 00:07:15.40
And without complaints and it was here at my house that Jodie explained to me why he needed a handy

91
00:07:15.40 --> 00:07:19.64
Gaply accessible room. He said yeah, you know man, I get home and I gotta take my legs off

92
00:07:19.64 --> 00:07:27.40
And then I gotta crawl to the bathroom to use the toilet and I gotta crawl to get in the shower and I need those little handles to pull myself up

93
00:07:31.24 --> 00:07:33.24
Be it's a struggle and

94
00:07:37.16 --> 00:07:42.68
Jodie suffered and struggled again not outwardly not in public

95
00:07:45.40 --> 00:07:47.40
But alone

96
00:07:47.40 --> 00:07:56.84
He pressed on and we kept in touch over the last couple years, you know, text messages and what's going on and did you see this and I sent to that

97
00:07:58.28 --> 00:08:03.80
And I watched as Jodie continued on his journey of his life and he is awesome to watch and he

98
00:08:04.36 --> 00:08:11.24
got back to Canada and he started to podcast and he continued with his political career and he wrote another best-selling book

99
00:08:11.72 --> 00:08:13.72
called everyday heroes

100
00:08:13.72 --> 00:08:18.36
And you know from a distance everything appeared to be going great

101
00:08:22.52 --> 00:08:23.16
But again

102
00:08:25.32 --> 00:08:28.52
Things aren't always what they seem and

103
00:08:29.64 --> 00:08:31.64
Behind all that

104
00:08:31.96 --> 00:08:34.20
Jodie was struggling

105
00:08:36.92 --> 00:08:39.40
And a couple months ago

106
00:08:39.40 --> 00:08:42.68
I got a text a simple text

107
00:08:44.04 --> 00:08:46.04
From Jodie and it read

108
00:08:47.48 --> 00:08:49.48
bro

109
00:08:50.36 --> 00:08:52.36
The enemy outflanked me

110
00:08:55.40 --> 00:08:58.04
Now in military terms

111
00:09:00.12 --> 00:09:07.08
That's about as bad as it gets it means the enemy has attacked your weakness means the enemy has the upper hand it means

112
00:09:07.08 --> 00:09:10.28
You have lost momentum in the battle

113
00:09:12.52 --> 00:09:15.48
And it means you could very likely be overrun

114
00:09:16.68 --> 00:09:19.16
That being overrun means that you're gonna get killed

115
00:09:22.12 --> 00:09:29.56
And I could see from that text that Jodie was at war again not on the battlefield but in his life

116
00:09:29.56 --> 00:09:36.68
But Jodie's a soldier

117
00:09:38.36 --> 00:09:41.96
And Jodie fought back because that's what soldiers do

118
00:09:45.16 --> 00:09:50.36
Then a little while later he sent another text that read on finally turning into the ambush

119
00:09:50.92 --> 00:09:52.60
And starting to fight through

120
00:09:52.60 --> 00:09:58.84
He attacked the problems

121
00:10:01.16 --> 00:10:04.76
He's back on track again back on the path

122
00:10:07.40 --> 00:10:09.56
And came down to visit me

123
00:10:11.16 --> 00:10:12.76
And after talking to him a little bit

124
00:10:13.80 --> 00:10:16.04
And discuss an what he's been through

125
00:10:16.84 --> 00:10:20.20
I asked him if he would come on and talk about it so

126
00:10:20.20 --> 00:10:26.92
Other people not not just veterans but everyone that struggles all of us

127
00:10:27.88 --> 00:10:32.68
Can learn from what he's been through and what he's overcome

128
00:10:35.64 --> 00:10:39.96
So here we are once again and with that

129
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.28
Jodie

130
00:10:42.28 --> 00:10:44.92
Joko welcome back to the podcast

131
00:10:44.92 --> 00:10:49.40
Wow you had me uh, you had me and I'll get in the fields there for a minute

132
00:10:50.44 --> 00:10:51.08
Thank you

133
00:10:51.56 --> 00:10:53.56
Yeah man it's um thank you for that

134
00:10:53.56 --> 00:10:57.96
You were talking to me last night about about the texts

135
00:10:59.72 --> 00:11:00.76
That you had sent me

136
00:11:01.80 --> 00:11:03.08
And you said you know there were some

137
00:11:03.80 --> 00:11:06.68
There were some heavy texts I sent you and and I was like really

138
00:11:08.04 --> 00:11:09.64
And you said yeah and I go

139
00:11:10.20 --> 00:11:12.20
Did I pick up on it and you were like yeah

140
00:11:12.20 --> 00:11:19.64
Yeah, and I thought you did well no when I read through my clearly did yeah and just through the responses and the conversation we were having

141
00:11:20.28 --> 00:11:22.28
But that that first

142
00:11:23.16 --> 00:11:29.40
Text that you sent uh all was like damn and and then I of course I went and

143
00:11:30.52 --> 00:11:35.80
Went back on your social media looked at what you been going through and you dropped off social media and so you had

144
00:11:36.76 --> 00:11:38.52
Basically reached out and said you know hey brother

145
00:11:38.52 --> 00:11:43.64
Need to lean a little air support over on this side and so

146
00:11:44.60 --> 00:11:50.92
What happened from I mean just you leave here from the from the last podcast two years ago you go back to Canada

147
00:11:51.24 --> 00:11:55.08
You start your podcast that was going great great podcast. Oh yeah

148
00:11:56.04 --> 00:12:00.28
Got all you know a lot of people are listening to it getting a lot of feedback from people a lot of people hitting me like

149
00:12:00.28 --> 00:12:02.28
Addodie's podcast is great

150
00:12:02.44 --> 00:12:07.72
So you're doing that you're working on the other book that just came when did that book come out October last October

151
00:12:07.72 --> 00:12:13.40
Last October hit the shelves best seller running boom yeah, so I was already I was already

152
00:12:14.12 --> 00:12:16.12
hadn't done a podcast since me

153
00:12:17.24 --> 00:12:21.16
Actually last podcast I did was with some guys from cansoff

154
00:12:21.96 --> 00:12:23.48
They started their own

155
00:12:23.48 --> 00:12:25.24
Company tactical beaver

156
00:12:25.24 --> 00:12:31.000
That was like supposed to springboard us into the next podcast we had some other guys coming in some other cansoff

157
00:12:31.24 --> 00:12:37.48
Entrepreneurs and we were starting to like kind of shift to supporting veterans in their business opportunity

158
00:12:37.48 --> 00:12:42.84
Because it seems like we're all becoming entrepreneurs or the guys that will employ our friends and things like that

159
00:12:42.84 --> 00:12:45.16
And that's what I want to focus on is how do we help the troops

160
00:12:45.88 --> 00:12:49.56
After they go through what I went through because I had zero plan

161
00:12:49.80 --> 00:12:54.52
Nobody had really dealt with this stuff in cantons since Korea really we had some guys in Bosnia

162
00:12:54.52 --> 00:13:00.60
And that but the the chain of command and then and the government frankly lied about the fact that Canadian forces were in combat

163
00:13:01.56 --> 00:13:03.56
In the in the former Yugoslavia

164
00:13:04.76 --> 00:13:06.76
That all aside the point is

165
00:13:06.76 --> 00:13:10.36
We were we were trying to lead by I was trying to lead by example

166
00:13:11.24 --> 00:13:13.24
Luke my my echo

167
00:13:13.24 --> 00:13:16.52
Luke was was trying to help out and he was doing his best and

168
00:13:17.40 --> 00:13:20.76
He was seeing the wheels fall off the jodimitic machine and

169
00:13:21.32 --> 00:13:24.12
He kept trying to like put him back on and gun tape them and

170
00:13:25.24 --> 00:13:30.60
Just do his best though, but because him and I it's not like we're like close buds like we're not like besties since we were kids or anything

171
00:13:30.60 --> 00:13:32.60
So he's trying to keep his distance and keep that

172
00:13:32.60 --> 00:13:42.52
Like jodimitic podcast is jodimidics and I'm I'm Luke I could tell too and I kept telling my friends that you know that were close as well like

173
00:13:42.52 --> 00:13:46.36
I can tell he really wants to help but he's not sure and then one day

174
00:13:48.68 --> 00:13:54.84
So I had a kind of a perfect storm so I moved out of my house in October last

175
00:13:56.04 --> 00:13:58.04
October 16 and

176
00:13:58.04 --> 00:14:04.12
You know, I'll just get that out of the way that was the beginning really of things going south and it's not cuz

177
00:14:04.76 --> 00:14:06.76
My X and I are

178
00:14:07.32 --> 00:14:12.12
Enemies by any stretch. We're still friends. We have two amazing kids. We had amazing life

179
00:14:12.28 --> 00:14:16.44
It's just sometimes you know sometimes you know units don't mesh right?

180
00:14:16.44 --> 00:14:22.12
That's just kind of the way it went. You know, we both have different visions of our future and and things like that

181
00:14:22.12 --> 00:14:23.40
So

182
00:14:23.40 --> 00:14:27.64
But then you kind of got to put on the the face for the public you know

183
00:14:29.48 --> 00:14:36.36
And so I stopped going to the gym at that time I stopped seeing my therapist just because he's on the other end of town and I can't be bothered right now

184
00:14:36.36 --> 00:14:38.36
I got too many other things to do

185
00:14:38.76 --> 00:14:40.36
And

186
00:14:40.36 --> 00:14:44.44
Even when I was here like you said you saw I forgot about that walk and you're right

187
00:14:44.44 --> 00:14:46.84
I remember sitting on the wall at

188
00:14:47.16 --> 00:14:50.44
Yeah, isn't it is it is it ocean beach? Oh, be yep and

189
00:14:50.44 --> 00:14:52.44
And

190
00:14:52.44 --> 00:14:58.28
I love like the American that's what we call in can americana history is amazing to me in the California beach

191
00:14:58.92 --> 00:15:01.48
Each beach has its own history and the in the group

192
00:15:01.88 --> 00:15:07.72
I love and you're talking about it and I'm looking around at all these buildings built in the 40s 50s 60s and then and in my mind

193
00:15:08.12 --> 00:15:10.76
I drove root 66 to get here like I love

194
00:15:11.56 --> 00:15:14.92
The history of this of this country so much and then I was on root 66

195
00:15:14.92 --> 00:15:22.36
Until I saw the pony express trail is to your left and I went okay turned left and I would follow the pony express trail down into Arizona

196
00:15:24.52 --> 00:15:26.52
But even then

197
00:15:26.52 --> 00:15:31.80
Like you said like the pain was really hitting me and I'm terrified of the pills because of becoming addicted

198
00:15:32.76 --> 00:15:34.52
And so

199
00:15:34.52 --> 00:15:36.76
Okay, what do you do for pain if you're not taking pills?

200
00:15:37.80 --> 00:15:41.96
And I'm not a weed guy like I know I talk about it and everything but I don't know anything about it

201
00:15:41.96 --> 00:15:48.04
But I know a lot about crown royal and jack Daniels and and Captain Morgan and I are good buddies and

202
00:15:49.24 --> 00:15:51.24
So I found

203
00:15:51.24 --> 00:15:55.24
I went from having a beer after work or in my case

204
00:15:55.24 --> 00:16:00.12
I like cider. I know I get made fun of for it, but booze booze boys. You know I'm saying

205
00:16:02.12 --> 00:16:06.04
I can't wait to have that cider after work or that that rummon coke

206
00:16:06.04 --> 00:16:12.68
When I get to the get to the pub with the with the guys and the guys now the guys that you're talking about now are your

207
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.20
Fellow people you're working with in the government a lot of them are politicians but also just some of the boys that

208
00:16:18.84 --> 00:16:22.60
Because otherwise like the biggest military posting in Canada

209
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.48
But also all the can saw for in that area. Got it. So I got you know buddies that are coming back from deployment and I rack

210
00:16:30.44 --> 00:16:34.92
On and off and they come in for their home for a month that gone for three home for three gone for a month

211
00:16:34.92 --> 00:16:38.44
Like so whenever you get it you hear from you run out and of course

212
00:16:38.76 --> 00:16:43.24
They just got back from the sandbox so they want to have a beer too and you know and I'm like

213
00:16:43.80 --> 00:16:47.000
Okay, because it might like I'm going going going I get up at six

214
00:16:47.80 --> 00:16:49.80
Put on my suit go to work

215
00:16:50.12 --> 00:16:54.12
Come home and I'm in pain the whole time and

216
00:16:54.52 --> 00:16:56.52
From the pain you saw to

217
00:16:57.08 --> 00:16:59.08
October 2016 and

218
00:16:59.64 --> 00:17:02.84
Then comes spring 2017 now it's just

219
00:17:02.84 --> 00:17:05.80
It's reached points where I

220
00:17:06.20 --> 00:17:12.04
Wouldn't but I was thinking about drinking before work and it's not because I'm like stressed out and I was stressed out

221
00:17:12.04 --> 00:17:15.24
But it's more like oh man like my look because I

222
00:17:15.72 --> 00:17:22.20
There is a deadening of the of the pain for sure and it's like well Uber ride is only 12 bucks to get the work and

223
00:17:22.20 --> 00:17:26.60
Just in that are my staff drives right by my place to go so I could have her pick me up

224
00:17:27.32 --> 00:17:29.96
And that discipline kept me from doing that for a while

225
00:17:29.96 --> 00:17:36.44
And then I had a trip to Oregon to go shooting at the Lea pole shooting academy

226
00:17:36.44 --> 00:17:38.76
They opened there that was great

227
00:17:39.88 --> 00:17:45.08
But before I left I think I took my legs off for a solid three to four weeks

228
00:17:45.96 --> 00:17:50.36
And as in my wheelchair and I kind of sucked because my car isn't set up to drive

229
00:17:50.84 --> 00:17:56.60
You know my place I got which is like a block from the house so it's not that far from the kids and in the accident

230
00:17:56.60 --> 00:18:00.92
Everything so you know I'm seeing them a lot anyway and stuff but

231
00:18:02.76 --> 00:18:09.56
Nothing else in my life is set up to live without legs even like where I keep my coffee in the kitchen is for when I'm on my legs

232
00:18:09.88 --> 00:18:15.56
So I'm in my I'm in my wheelchair the first day and I'm like I don't really make coffee when I'm in my wheelchair do I

233
00:18:16.20 --> 00:18:17.16
Oh

234
00:18:17.16 --> 00:18:19.16
Tongues right so I get tongs out of the cupboard

235
00:18:19.72 --> 00:18:23.32
Reach off. I can do this whatever a daft and that's like okay time to go to work

236
00:18:23.32 --> 00:18:28.12
Oh shoot and then I did call my staff and she picked me up. All right took a noober

237
00:18:29.40 --> 00:18:32.20
But then I went to Oregon and that was a week

238
00:18:33.08 --> 00:18:36.60
Like it was about 789 dead nine days on my leg straight

239
00:18:38.28 --> 00:18:46.20
Excruciating pain the whole time. Well whatever with happening the doctor I finally went back and she was said that like my skin had reached a point where it couldn't regenerate

240
00:18:46.52 --> 00:18:47.64
Fast enough

241
00:18:47.64 --> 00:18:53.56
So it was just breaking down and then the way I like to wear my legs was being rejected by the body

242
00:18:53.56 --> 00:18:57.80
So I like to wear it with like it's called a suction a suction holds was like a vacuum

243
00:18:58.36 --> 00:19:03.16
Until you release it with a with a valve and my body was like well we're done with this

244
00:19:03.72 --> 00:19:05.24
But I'm like oh, no

245
00:19:05.24 --> 00:19:11.72
Me no like legs legs sleeve legs sleeve take away mobility. Me no want and so my you know that if you're gonna be

246
00:19:11.72 --> 00:19:18.60
Dumb you better be tough and things come but you gotta be tough yeah, and you know and and and and I didn't have

247
00:19:18.60 --> 00:19:20.60
I'm not living with with a medic anymore

248
00:19:21.16 --> 00:19:23.64
Right so she's not there to be like hey stupid

249
00:19:24.28 --> 00:19:27.80
But yourself they take the legs off and let it someone take care of you

250
00:19:28.36 --> 00:19:30.36
My mom actually moved to Ottawa

251
00:19:30.68 --> 00:19:37.48
December 16 and I'm completely ignoring her advice because you know what mom's always gonna try and look after you

252
00:19:37.48 --> 00:19:39.88
But come on mom I'm 40 years old Jesus

253
00:19:39.88 --> 00:19:41.32
Um

254
00:19:41.32 --> 00:19:47.80
And I was pushing away against a lot of the same same things I would then in the same day would tell people like hey man

255
00:19:47.96 --> 00:19:53.000
You gotta let people look after you know because I get texts I probably same as you right I get texts

256
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.28
BBMs I get

257
00:19:54.28 --> 00:20:00.36
DMs on Instagram and and Twitter and Facebook on my fan page and then the podcast page

258
00:20:01.24 --> 00:20:05.16
Hey, what's going on like I need help with this and be like don't be afraid to go get help

259
00:20:05.16 --> 00:20:11.000
Don't be afraid to reach out those around you love you let them look after and I'm completely ignoring any of this advice myself

260
00:20:11.88 --> 00:20:14.84
Because I'm like I kicked oxy cotton when I was

261
00:20:15.48 --> 00:20:19.24
22 I think and on deployment I stopped smoking just because I wanted to

262
00:20:20.36 --> 00:20:26.28
I drank on the weekend. I don't need to drink but need me while I'm sitting there checking these messages while having a drink

263
00:20:28.04 --> 00:20:32.28
I know and I look back and I'm like oh so stupid, but I guess sometimes you gotta go through

264
00:20:32.28 --> 00:20:37.000
There's a reason why you go back to basics. Is there like in your mind when you're going through that?

265
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.96
Are you thinking yourself I could stop if I wanted to every day. I just don't want to yeah

266
00:20:41.96 --> 00:20:47.80
I don't it's not getting in the way of anything. I'm still functional. I'm still at work. I'm still doing

267
00:20:48.28 --> 00:20:53.08
To me my main job was what I was elected to do right now have a four-year in my mind

268
00:20:53.08 --> 00:20:58.44
It's like it's kind of like being in the army where you're on four-year for your commitments right so I'm like well right now

269
00:20:58.44 --> 00:21:04.44
I have a four-year commitment. I'm not drinking at work. I mean at some point I did start drinking at work, but

270
00:21:05.56 --> 00:21:11.32
And politics and business as you know like sometimes after lunch instead of going back to the office you have a beer

271
00:21:12.12 --> 00:21:14.84
And you're still working you're still talking about

272
00:21:15.72 --> 00:21:18.36
Issues you're still getting like I used to get a lot of advice from

273
00:21:19.08 --> 00:21:23.96
I shouldn't say used to I get a lot of advice from the other more experienced politicians because that's what you do

274
00:21:23.96 --> 00:21:34.76
And we all would have a beer or a cider and then they'd go back to the office and I'd stay and keep on the phone and

275
00:21:35.16 --> 00:21:40.36
Yeah, I have one more, you know and another group of guys would come in from like oh

276
00:21:40.36 --> 00:21:47.000
Hey, you're still here like you know someone so I was already back at city hall what kind of what kind of drunk are you?

277
00:21:48.20 --> 00:21:53.56
Happy I'm a happy go lucky. I get a little loud, but it's not like I'm like hey

278
00:21:53.56 --> 00:21:55.56
What's going on? I'm better

279
00:21:57.08 --> 00:22:01.96
But they're you know anyway, well, I know it's here. No, no, I'm actually just asking it

280
00:22:02.36 --> 00:22:08.04
Like you could you could still call them phone and be like hey, buddy, blah, blah, blah, you know some people when they drink they get angry

281
00:22:08.60 --> 00:22:14.52
Some people when they drink they slur their speech really bad. Yeah, so you got all these different types of you know

282
00:22:14.92 --> 00:22:18.68
Drinkers when I drink I basically just like a more of

283
00:22:18.68 --> 00:22:24.28
Jocco yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm more jody yeah for the most part. I do slur, but even I could be like

284
00:22:24.28 --> 00:22:30.28
I swear my words, okay, well, I'll drink some water for a minute and then I'll get it back or I'll have a coffee

285
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.96
And I'm good. I'm normal and even when I'm like I rarely get fall over drunk

286
00:22:38.28 --> 00:22:42.68
Right, if ever, but let me rewind. I know it's a long answer to a short question, but

287
00:22:43.24 --> 00:22:46.84
So may I get back from Oregon and I'm just like

288
00:22:46.84 --> 00:22:53.16
Dianne and then I had to go real quick down to Albany because of part of my job with the city is I'm the sports commissioner

289
00:22:53.56 --> 00:22:58.04
And I'm desperately trying to get the CrossFit games to bring the eastern regional

290
00:22:58.84 --> 00:23:02.52
Games to Ottawa because I just think that'd be awesome to have an Ottawa

291
00:23:02.52 --> 00:23:06.20
We you know we got the UFC in Ottawa. I was a part of that

292
00:23:06.20 --> 00:23:11.56
So I was really proud and I said when I got the job I said I want to do two things in the four years if the UFC and get CrossFit games

293
00:23:12.36 --> 00:23:16.12
So I'm still trying to do the CrossFit games. I got less than a year to do it, but I think we can do it

294
00:23:16.12 --> 00:23:18.12
But anyway, that's a lot of people that

295
00:23:18.52 --> 00:23:21.32
Participate in CrossFit that listen to this podcast

296
00:23:21.32 --> 00:23:27.40
Maybe I met a lot of them and you know what the CrossFit guys are crafty and Albany city itself

297
00:23:27.40 --> 00:23:30.76
They don't want to lose the CrossFit games so they knew I was in town and they started to

298
00:23:31.24 --> 00:23:36.12
Sweat in the deal if you know what I mean and the CrossFit games go well a lot of was off for us this album

299
00:23:36.12 --> 00:23:39.80
You would you guys hey, it's business. I get it, but you know what I'm coming back

300
00:23:39.80 --> 00:23:47.24
Um, I got back from that trip. That was about a four day trip from Ottawa to Albany and back and

301
00:23:47.96 --> 00:23:50.60
When I was here with you guys I didn't bring a wheelchair

302
00:23:50.92 --> 00:23:58.12
Because that's what I meant by I crawl around which is why I could stay at your house, but I don't want your kids see in a grown man crawl to the bathroom

303
00:23:58.60 --> 00:24:03.88
And it's not because I'm above crawling it's just it's one of those personal things in my own space

304
00:24:04.28 --> 00:24:07.32
I'm not above it and around like loved ones okay

305
00:24:07.32 --> 00:24:13.16
So that's why you want your own space and even and stuff like that so even when I visit my dad

306
00:24:13.16 --> 00:24:19.96
I get a hotel room right on my dad loves me and it's I'm not but it's also my space where if I want to crawl around naked I can

307
00:24:20.12 --> 00:24:22.12
Right and

308
00:24:22.12 --> 00:24:23.72
So anyway

309
00:24:23.72 --> 00:24:29.88
That's why that so then I get back and I take the legs off and I just I can't put them back on

310
00:24:30.44 --> 00:24:34.52
I look I would like I don't know if I said it on your show last time, but I have mornings

311
00:24:34.52 --> 00:24:39.40
Right look at my prosthetics. I'm like fuck sorry sorry, I know we're allowed, but

312
00:24:39.88 --> 00:24:45.16
I'm trying to be a little bit bit of a man. I go you know what I mean? I mean I go I don't want you have to edit out things that I say

313
00:24:46.36 --> 00:24:48.36
Okay, it's so good

314
00:24:48.36 --> 00:24:53.24
Um, I took him off and I just looked I just threw him across through when I said I can't

315
00:24:53.56 --> 00:25:00.28
Deal I have a wound in my left stump. I did I show it to you? No, it's been there since April of

316
00:25:01.56 --> 00:25:03.56
14

317
00:25:03.56 --> 00:25:09.48
And it happened I remember the second it happened my brother and I were doing an amazing race thing post show

318
00:25:10.68 --> 00:25:16.12
In Alberta and we did a little like you know go hey Jody and Cory from amazing race

319
00:25:16.12 --> 00:25:18.52
We got a few bucks for it. We gave us a speech to

320
00:25:19.64 --> 00:25:22.12
some kind of convention and then

321
00:25:22.76 --> 00:25:27.88
I was walking down the airport to to the plane and I felt something's going my foot

322
00:25:27.88 --> 00:25:31.88
It's and it's like having a hot spot when you're on a rock march or whatever

323
00:25:31.88 --> 00:25:40.68
Except I can't really shift what part of my foot I'm walking on I just can't and it went from a little tiny like break in the skin to

324
00:25:40.76 --> 00:25:43.64
Something the size and can we have two knees it's two dollars?

325
00:25:43.88 --> 00:25:49.80
You I know you guys still use the dollar if you sent peace like a fifty cent peace and then back now it's down to like a pin prick of

326
00:25:50.20 --> 00:25:51.16
Scab

327
00:25:51.16 --> 00:25:53.16
But that's what we talking now we're

328
00:25:53.16 --> 00:25:55.16
Almost four years

329
00:25:55.16 --> 00:26:01.64
Right and I had to mitigate that the whole time and it was painful and I got a couple of I got two infections and

330
00:26:01.64 --> 00:26:03.64
In the four years from it

331
00:26:04.12 --> 00:26:08.68
But that's where I was like that's it. I need to let myself heal. I need to like

332
00:26:09.80 --> 00:26:17.16
Let my body regenerate except now from that and it took me until fall

333
00:26:19.16 --> 00:26:23.64
Late fall to realize that when I did that I might as well have stepped on another landmine

334
00:26:24.76 --> 00:26:30.92
And I went through it took me to late fall to go because I was like because that's when things really went south

335
00:26:30.92 --> 00:26:36.92
Because you basically not even basically because you lost your legs again. Yeah, I lost my legs again

336
00:26:37.64 --> 00:26:41.64
Except because truly when you were down here even though you were in pain

337
00:26:41.88 --> 00:26:44.44
Bro, we were doing you know we were walking up and downstairs

338
00:26:44.44 --> 00:26:48.44
We were we're doing whatever we walked all over that aircraft part over that aircraft carrier up and downstairs

339
00:26:48.44 --> 00:26:51.56
We walked all over the seal compound. We walked there. You know we I loved it

340
00:26:51.56 --> 00:26:58.44
Now and out on the beach when we walked out on the beach where you guys torture the the recruit. Yeah, yeah, it's every step

341
00:26:58.44 --> 00:27:00.44
I was like oh

342
00:27:00.44 --> 00:27:03.96
Because he got a dig through the sand. Yeah, but to me that's hollowed ground, bro

343
00:27:03.96 --> 00:27:07.80
Like when you took me to the grinder. I remember standing there like this is the grinder like

344
00:27:08.20 --> 00:27:13.000
I'm okay. I'm kidding army and but there's some things where you go you just you feel

345
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.16
Right if I brought you up to the recruit spot and for basic in the can you know army you'd you'd feel you get that feeling

346
00:27:19.16 --> 00:27:23.08
Like this is where soldiers are born. Yeah. That's it. You know say there's been a lot of those little

347
00:27:23.08 --> 00:27:28.36
They have the little fins on the grinder so the what what Jody's talking about is where they train seals

348
00:27:29.08 --> 00:27:32.92
That first day in the movies, right? Yeah, it's and they have little

349
00:27:34.28 --> 00:27:39.32
Fins so like little dive fins there's little for you know the Marine Corps they have boots

350
00:27:39.96 --> 00:27:42.76
In the army they have boots painted on the ground. They paint them on the ground

351
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.04
Well in the on the grinder at buds they have little swim fins two little tiny swim fins are painted

352
00:27:48.04 --> 00:27:54.60
And there's you know a couple hundred of them and that's when you get out there for PT you stand on your little set of swim fins and then as the days go by

353
00:27:54.60 --> 00:28:02.84
There's less and less yeah, yeah, and then and I've read I've read if I've read less than 24 Navy seal books from

354
00:28:03.40 --> 00:28:10.12
From the beginning to today right yours included I'd be surprised. I've read I've read the the old lirps

355
00:28:11.32 --> 00:28:14.44
Those guys have read about the original rangers. I've read about the Canadian

356
00:28:14.44 --> 00:28:20.76
American special service forests actually when I was with Rob my buddy from the green braids down in Numa

357
00:28:21.16 --> 00:28:24.68
I was wearing a ranger up t-shirt that's like a special service forest tribute

358
00:28:25.24 --> 00:28:32.12
You know to me like that's our history that's the history of of of soft in Canada and the US and and then you know and buds

359
00:28:32.12 --> 00:28:36.20
And the green braids or Navy seals the green braids are kind of created by Kennedy at the same

360
00:28:36.20 --> 00:28:38.68
Bob see look at me. I'm a fucking nerd when it comes to this stuff

361
00:28:39.56 --> 00:28:41.56
So to me you know the I

362
00:28:41.56 --> 00:28:47.24
Haven't been there but I've heard about it because a lot of my friends have been there the Aussies

363
00:28:47.96 --> 00:28:53.08
They have a parade ground like the middle of their compound if you've been there. No, I've never been Australia

364
00:28:53.08 --> 00:28:59.56
They're the the only time they use this parade ground apparently is at Memorial services for their men

365
00:28:59.56 --> 00:29:02.60
Yeah, and I believe that no one walks on it

366
00:29:02.60 --> 00:29:11.000
It's just in the middle of their compound no one walks on it. Well in Canada we have a similar thing where if you're on the parade square and it's not parade

367
00:29:11.32 --> 00:29:15.40
Like you're going on extra duty like if the sergeant major catches you on his parade square

368
00:29:15.96 --> 00:29:22.36
A you better be have a broom in your hand or you better be on parade and if you're not like because it's it's usually like

369
00:29:22.36 --> 00:29:23.80
Oh, if I go from here to there

370
00:29:23.80 --> 00:29:27.80
It's right across the parade square, but it's the short route. Yeah, and it's like one of those tests, right?

371
00:29:27.80 --> 00:29:35.72
There's a new guys in the hallways of most units the unit emblem is in the floor and and there's one of those sergeants

372
00:29:35.88 --> 00:29:39.80
That just has nothing better to do but to stand there and watch and see who steps on the

373
00:29:40.60 --> 00:29:43.08
And even if you're like family of one of the troops

374
00:29:44.92 --> 00:29:47.88
Oh my god, I don't even get the knife hand. It's awesome, but

375
00:29:48.52 --> 00:29:53.80
When I was here I wasn't gonna not go see the grinder because my fucking legs hurt don't be a pussy

376
00:29:53.80 --> 00:29:57.56
And I'll be honest that first night after you dropped me off. I had a couple drinks

377
00:29:58.52 --> 00:30:03.24
To ease the ease the day like when we left your porch and you dropped me back at the hotel yeah

378
00:30:05.24 --> 00:30:09.40
I went and I had a few drinks the hotel bar you know and I and I I was

379
00:30:09.96 --> 00:30:15.80
Actually toying with talking to you about this stuff back then because it was bugging me event and I'm like okay

380
00:30:15.80 --> 00:30:17.56
What do I do? What do I talk to?

381
00:30:17.56 --> 00:30:22.92
Talk was a kind of guy echoed is the kind of energy you want to be around and like you know and that's one of the

382
00:30:22.92 --> 00:30:24.92
Part of this trip

383
00:30:24.92 --> 00:30:27.64
For the last ten days I've been on is it's kind of like refining

384
00:30:28.12 --> 00:30:32.68
a lot of my Canadian and American friends that have kept me on on the straight narrow

385
00:30:33.40 --> 00:30:35.40
All right, as much as you can did for jodimitic and

386
00:30:37.48 --> 00:30:42.12
It's a little bro. It's a constant wrestling match, right? The little evil and the good angel except a lot of times

387
00:30:42.12 --> 00:30:44.12
They high five each other. Okay. Let's see what happens

388
00:30:44.12 --> 00:30:46.12
And

389
00:30:47.24 --> 00:30:51.64
And yeah, man, so when the legs came off so no car so now my mommy

390
00:30:52.44 --> 00:30:59.16
Uber or my staff or my ex or driving me around all happy to do it all not like holding it against me

391
00:30:59.16 --> 00:31:02.12
But at the same time man, I I'm out of sandwich meat

392
00:31:03.40 --> 00:31:04.44
Hmm

393
00:31:04.44 --> 00:31:06.44
Okay, now I need to go to the store

394
00:31:07.24 --> 00:31:11.32
Hey mommy can can you drive my car and take me to the store and

395
00:31:11.32 --> 00:31:15.80
And then that's I kind of turned my hat backwards and kind of like you know

396
00:31:16.36 --> 00:31:19.96
Try to like you know cowboy up and do it

397
00:31:21.08 --> 00:31:23.08
But I took me again until

398
00:31:23.40 --> 00:31:29.48
In my daughter turned nine September 19th I think it was her I missed a lot of her birthday for being hung over

399
00:31:30.68 --> 00:31:34.28
And she was at this awesome trampoline place and I'm in a wheelchair

400
00:31:35.16 --> 00:31:36.68
And I remember getting there and being like

401
00:31:36.68 --> 00:31:44.68
All I want to do right now is jump on trampolines with my with my little girl and I can't and be I'm an hour and a half late for her party

402
00:31:45.96 --> 00:31:52.04
Because I decided to have too many drinks last night and that was when I was like what the fuck is really wrong with me

403
00:31:52.68 --> 00:31:53.72
Because I couldn't

404
00:31:54.04 --> 00:31:58.28
Really get it and then what is what is the escalation?

405
00:31:58.84 --> 00:32:02.76
Right, so you were down here with me. Yeah, you know we worked hard

406
00:32:02.76 --> 00:32:09.64
We because it is you know, you want a podcast like when we when we do sit there and talk to each other about intense stuff for five hours

407
00:32:09.64 --> 00:32:15.56
Yeah, then we went and ate we stayed up late. We get up early the next day. We go do all the stuff that we did and you get done

408
00:32:15.56 --> 00:32:17.56
You have a couple drinks right

409
00:32:18.12 --> 00:32:22.20
What does that escalation look like over time where you're like you know what?

410
00:32:22.44 --> 00:32:27.56
You're not even saying like oh, I don't know if I stabbed drinks. You're like hey, as soon as the jocco gets in his car

411
00:32:27.56 --> 00:32:29.56
I'm getting some drinks right now

412
00:32:29.56 --> 00:32:34.68
Yeah, it's something that you recognized is it something that you just you just said to yourself

413
00:32:34.68 --> 00:32:36.68
You know what this is gonna make me feel better right now and I gotta go

414
00:32:36.68 --> 00:32:42.04
I don't remember exactly what month I was here do you like I don't remember no

415
00:32:42.44 --> 00:32:46.60
I know it was a warm month and and Canada like it was cool, but I was spring or fall

416
00:32:47.96 --> 00:32:53.08
Well, we started in December. It was 24 podcasts in that's how many December of what?

417
00:32:53.96 --> 00:32:56.84
2015 so must have been spring for

418
00:32:56.84 --> 00:33:00.20
15th or 16. Yeah spring spring 16 so I

419
00:33:00.20 --> 00:33:05.000
I remember in Canada it wasn't cold but like we were wearing still wearing down vests with food with hoodies and stuff

420
00:33:05.32 --> 00:33:07.96
When I was doing my quick podcast for a left so

421
00:33:08.76 --> 00:33:14.04
At that time I was it was just the pain was just kind of like a couple drinks for bed, right?

422
00:33:14.04 --> 00:33:18.68
But even that was bugging me and that's what I mean like when I was but then like if

423
00:33:19.88 --> 00:33:21.88
If it had been this spring

424
00:33:22.36 --> 00:33:24.92
Where we'd met? Yeah, I would have been like

425
00:33:24.92 --> 00:33:28.36
Like like this the whole time and like as soon as jocco's gone

426
00:33:28.36 --> 00:33:30.20
I might as just like last night when we had dinner

427
00:33:30.20 --> 00:33:34.28
I might have just been like fogg it. I'm having drinks. Yeah. I don't care if jocco's here because

428
00:33:35.40 --> 00:33:37.40
Being around someone like you like

429
00:33:37.40 --> 00:33:41.40
And I used to be the guy who could I don't need to drink I would go month and be like oh, yeah

430
00:33:41.40 --> 00:33:44.20
I'm in a drink like you know, I'll have a drink and

431
00:33:45.16 --> 00:33:50.76
And you don't drink and you haven't drinks until you were like in your 20s. I think you still don't know. I haven't drank since I retired

432
00:33:50.76 --> 00:33:57.24
Oh, okay, so it's time I felt the effects of alcohol which I felt quite strongly was that the basically the day I retired

433
00:33:57.56 --> 00:34:00.12
Yeah, you hear the day I retired which was

434
00:34:00.84 --> 00:34:05.48
October 1st 2010, you know, of course mean the boys we went out

435
00:34:05.80 --> 00:34:10.68
We had a bunch of drinks. I woke up in the morning because I still wake up early and I woke up in the morning

436
00:34:10.68 --> 00:34:14.28
And I was like well, yeah, that's done because I got other stuff I got to do now and

437
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Basically when I no longer had

438
00:34:17.64 --> 00:34:19.64
We'll call him friends to drink with

439
00:34:19.64 --> 00:34:25.56
Yeah, then I was like, yeah, well, I'm done with that and I just ever since then just haven't really

440
00:34:26.12 --> 00:34:31.40
You know, I've had and another thing is sometimes people think I'm like offended if they have drinks or whatever

441
00:34:31.40 --> 00:34:32.76
I'm not you know

442
00:34:32.76 --> 00:34:36.44
I remember actually I went I was on the first podcast. I was on was Tim Farruses

443
00:34:37.16 --> 00:34:39.80
And we got done with the podcast and

444
00:34:40.12 --> 00:34:45.24
You know, we went out to group grab some food because I was staying the night at his house and we went out and we got some food

445
00:34:45.24 --> 00:34:50.92
We got some steak and he's like do you mind if I have it class of wine with this? I was like, oh, I don't care

446
00:34:50.92 --> 00:34:56.76
You know, yeah, you're not like a reformed alcohol or yeah, you just decided one day you're like my dad one day

447
00:34:56.76 --> 00:35:00.60
He was like, yeah, this gets in the way of work. Yeah, that's kind of that's kind of my attitude

448
00:35:00.60 --> 00:35:02.20
It doesn't really yeah

449
00:35:02.20 --> 00:35:05.88
And if I want to drink something that tastes good then I'll drink a chocolate milk

450
00:35:06.04 --> 00:35:10.84
Which I love the taste of yeah, I had a chocolate white tea right? I mean that stuff makes me feel good

451
00:35:10.84 --> 00:35:17.40
And I just yeah and people asked me a lot and I need it something that I need to address on the podcast because the other thing is just

452
00:35:17.40 --> 00:35:20.36
I might as well delve into this a little bit right at this moment, but when I was a kid

453
00:35:21.08 --> 00:35:28.92
I was in the hardcore music. I was into and and the type of music that I listened to was against drinking and against

454
00:35:29.08 --> 00:35:31.16
Like it was yeah, but the

455
00:35:31.16 --> 00:35:41.08
But you tried it. Yeah, we're talking straight edge. We're talking minor threat. Yeah, really. Yes, absolutely and so it was almost and I was again

456
00:35:41.08 --> 00:35:47.32
I was never really I'm very I'm very I'm not a real good follower

457
00:35:48.04 --> 00:35:50.84
So anytime there's some kind of a movement going on

458
00:35:51.32 --> 00:35:54.92
I'm always like saying wait, why is this movement going on? Why yeah? I was questioning

459
00:35:54.92 --> 00:36:00.12
I don't just jump in I'm hard to get on board with something like that

460
00:36:00.12 --> 00:36:06.36
So it was around I wasn't like so there's a there's a thing with straight edge. Okay, so this this thing was called straight edge

461
00:36:06.36 --> 00:36:13.80
It started and I'd say you'd the the epicenter of it was in Washington DC the first band really to coin the term was

462
00:36:14.52 --> 00:36:16.92
Minor threat which is a punk band

463
00:36:17.16 --> 00:36:24.84
Hard to find better than my assumes they were partiers. No, not at all. Just by the name no and so one of the things that one of the symbols of straight edge was

464
00:36:24.84 --> 00:36:30.68
You know when you go to a bar when kids used to go to bars for a show for a for a music show

465
00:36:31.16 --> 00:36:34.76
If they were too young to drink once when the bounce looked at their ID card

466
00:36:34.76 --> 00:36:41.72
They'd put a big X on their hands and so the straight edge symbol was they'd put the X's on their hands

467
00:36:41.72 --> 00:36:44.76
Meaning look I don't drink and it's actually funny because I took my

468
00:36:45.40 --> 00:36:50.04
To my kids to see the white buffalo the other night in San Diego and it was awesome

469
00:36:50.04 --> 00:36:55.40
And but when they came when they showed their ID is they got the X's on their hands and

470
00:36:56.52 --> 00:37:02.12
I was like oh yeah, so you know fans so what the straight edge kids would do is they would draw big

471
00:37:02.60 --> 00:37:09.40
X's on their hands meaning hey look I'm not drinking so there was that and then that of course morphed into like a gang

472
00:37:10.04 --> 00:37:12.52
And there was you know by the time I was a

473
00:37:12.84 --> 00:37:18.92
You know middle teenager there was hardcore gangs that would assault people that drank and

474
00:37:18.92 --> 00:37:22.44
Would get crazy while it was together with the jugglers

475
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.28
Yeah, so it just so so when I was a kid

476
00:37:26.92 --> 00:37:29.72
I was okay, and I wasn't like a full-on

477
00:37:29.96 --> 00:37:33.72
I wasn't drawing that kind of thing. No, I never like had X's on my Instagram

478
00:37:33.72 --> 00:37:35.72
But I but I understood

479
00:37:35.96 --> 00:37:39.56
Philosophically right what was being said right which was look

480
00:37:40.28 --> 00:37:43.000
I want to win right I'm hardcore

481
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.08
I want to be stronger. I want to be a where I want to be alert and

482
00:37:47.08 --> 00:37:50.04
Drinking and doing drugs doesn't give me any those things so

483
00:37:50.84 --> 00:37:56.28
At that so sorry, but even at that age you understood the fuel goes into the machine affects the performance

484
00:37:56.68 --> 00:38:02.36
Yes, he I didn't get that as a young man. Yes, but so here I am and and it was you know

485
00:38:02.36 --> 00:38:10.20
I was in discipline and you know I had a before the seals. Oh, yeah, I had a band a hardcore band the name of my hardcore band

486
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.28
Was rage of discipline that was the name of my hardcore band that was after that was what that's what

487
00:38:16.28 --> 00:38:20.20
Bronson's children because my first band when I was like 13 was called Bronson's children

488
00:38:20.20 --> 00:38:24.28
But then as I got older and I got more hardcore then it became a rage of discipline

489
00:38:24.28 --> 00:38:28.36
There's also about nine other Bronson's children Bronson's children's Charles Charles

490
00:38:28.92 --> 00:38:31.24
He didn't drink I don't even know oh

491
00:38:31.24 --> 00:38:32.92
You know

492
00:38:32.92 --> 00:38:35.64
We do know Charles Bronson was a badass when I was a kid

493
00:38:35.96 --> 00:38:39.56
I thought Charles Bronson was the man because he was the baddest man on the planet. Yeah, he was you know a

494
00:38:40.76 --> 00:38:42.76
tail gunner in a

495
00:38:42.76 --> 00:38:48.60
You know bomber World War II and he grew up in the mines when he was a kid when he was 10 years old or 11 years old

496
00:38:48.60 --> 00:38:50.60
He was working in the mines and

497
00:38:51.72 --> 00:38:56.76
Until he was old enough he used to have to wear a dress because he didn't have his parents and have money to buy him close

498
00:38:56.76 --> 00:38:59.16
He had to wear one of his sisters dresses down in the mines

499
00:38:59.40 --> 00:39:03.48
So then he went to World War II and then he became and you know he's he's just had great movies

500
00:39:03.48 --> 00:39:07.32
He always played this stoic character that was on emotional and so I was you know

501
00:39:07.32 --> 00:39:09.64
Hey when I grew up on a beach Charles Bronson of course

502
00:39:09.64 --> 00:39:16.12
So then we had a band who was called Bronson Children well as we got more hardcore eventually that name morphed into

503
00:39:16.84 --> 00:39:22.12
Rage of discipline of which Elgin James was the guitarist who's another buddy of mine that echo is mad

504
00:39:22.12 --> 00:39:26.60
Who will come on the podcast at some point and tell his crazy life story which I'm a

505
00:39:27.16 --> 00:39:32.92
Big part of in the beginning until you say alter we got the year the pre military jocco series

506
00:39:34.12 --> 00:39:36.52
So I'll be tuned into that one long story

507
00:39:36.52 --> 00:39:40.04
Then I joined the military. Yeah, so when I joined the military

508
00:39:40.44 --> 00:39:44.52
What do I want to be I want to be a seal? I want to be a frog man. I want to be the best frog man

509
00:39:44.52 --> 00:39:49.48
I can be I show up at a sealed team guess what frog man do frog man drink? Okay cool

510
00:39:49.48 --> 00:39:53.08
I didn't know that now that I know that give me a give his shot a egg or myster

511
00:39:53.08 --> 00:39:57.88
Cause I made a rock and roll and that was sort of how you proved yourself and that's what we did and I was

512
00:39:58.44 --> 00:40:00.44
immature and dumb and

513
00:40:01.32 --> 00:40:02.04
And

514
00:40:02.04 --> 00:40:04.92
Despite everything I just said about like hey, I'm a little bit

515
00:40:04.92 --> 00:40:08.04
I'm hesitant to really follow well now I'm in the sealed teams

516
00:40:08.28 --> 00:40:12.52
This is my dream job and this is what I want to do and if you don't buy in you're not in

517
00:40:12.60 --> 00:40:17.08
Yeah, and it's like it's not I don't even know if it's it's just like that's the way it is. That's yeah

518
00:40:17.64 --> 00:40:23.72
My first drink I was 17 right after I finished basic training. I show up at the regiment and they're like all right

519
00:40:23.80 --> 00:40:27.72
What are you drinking and I'm like because my family's full of alcoholics on both sides?

520
00:40:28.44 --> 00:40:29.32
And it's nothing

521
00:40:29.32 --> 00:40:35.000
I guess I'm like you know grandpa was my other grandpa was and grandpa's grandpa was and you know one of my own

522
00:40:35.64 --> 00:40:39.72
Nothing okay, they might hear this but we all know what you do. Okay, right so not a big deal, but

523
00:40:40.52 --> 00:40:45.72
And dad but dad was one of those guys. He was like well, I just doesn't affect me and me personally like you as a kid

524
00:40:45.72 --> 00:40:49.24
I'm like I don't really see the interest like what I can throw up on myself and

525
00:40:49.88 --> 00:40:54.84
Whatever whatever and I was one of those kids that say no to drugs actually worked on you know like

526
00:40:54.84 --> 00:40:59.000
Like now molder and like man I should have been smoking weed says like 12 and shit, but

527
00:41:00.68 --> 00:41:04.36
I still don't but I did I just like you see the effects on people like when I was a bounce

528
00:41:04.36 --> 00:41:10.20
I'm like yeah, the guy just smoked weed or really mellow. Yeah, and the guy that had co-condrank like they were the one doing the problem

529
00:41:10.84 --> 00:41:11.88
But

530
00:41:11.88 --> 00:41:16.12
When I get to the regiment the first night of parade is done and they're like, hey, what are you drinking?

531
00:41:16.12 --> 00:41:20.68
I'm like well, I'm 17. They're like this is an army mess like it's okay. Just won't worry

532
00:41:20.68 --> 00:41:25.80
We're all gonna keep it up like it's not like I'm not trying to tell the world like hey under age people drink

533
00:41:25.80 --> 00:41:30.68
But hey under age people drink, but it's an environment full of people that are there to look out for each other anyway

534
00:41:31.16 --> 00:41:36.20
So I had a couple of drinks and I'm like okay, this is the way it is and same thing yeah work

535
00:41:36.44 --> 00:41:42.32
Monday to Friday you work your ass off you go hard as you can like you go hard in the paint right

536
00:41:42.32 --> 00:41:45.68
You your your tires are stripped at the end of the day

537
00:41:46.28 --> 00:41:48.52
Friday rolls around okay

538
00:41:48.52 --> 00:41:52.44
Don't see it eight a.m. Monday morning boys and you know

539
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.84
If you're gonna drink don't drive, but if you do drink driver that's what you got told when you when you're dismissed for the weekend, right?

540
00:41:58.84 --> 00:42:06.36
Yeah, and so basically have a fun blow off the steam don't hurt anybody and take care of each other is basically what you're told

541
00:42:06.76 --> 00:42:07.96
So

542
00:42:07.96 --> 00:42:14.28
The seal team's definitely is a culture it was even more when I first got in because now you're talking about the old Vietnam guys

543
00:42:14.28 --> 00:42:20.12
And it wasn't a war going on and it was just hey, what are you gonna do if there's no war going on and you're

544
00:42:20.84 --> 00:42:25.24
You're a frog man. What are you gonna do well? We drank and and I'm not I'm gonna look down on it

545
00:42:25.24 --> 00:42:29.70
We had a great time. It was fun. I just bonded. We had you know, it was it was fun. It was what you know

546
00:42:29.70 --> 00:42:32.60
What we did and I'm not even trying to say anything negative about it

547
00:42:33.08 --> 00:42:36.60
But that's what it was and unfortunately there's a lot of guys

548
00:42:37.64 --> 00:42:39.64
I should even say a lot there's a

549
00:42:39.64 --> 00:42:46.60
A decent number of guys that don't do well without call man and it ruins their lives ruins their careers and that sucks

550
00:42:46.60 --> 00:42:49.40
It sucks to see I never really had any issues. I

551
00:42:49.96 --> 00:42:53.40
Drank when I drank I never get into fear of my way in any way and

552
00:42:54.04 --> 00:43:00.000
You know that was it wasn't a huge deal and I mean of course when I mean when I'm talking when I was

553
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.60
19 20 21 22 and we drank a lot

554
00:43:03.64 --> 00:43:05.08
We drank a lot

555
00:43:05.08 --> 00:43:09.92
Weird how your body legic that is yeah, yeah, and you got up the next morning

556
00:43:09.92 --> 00:43:11.000
Yeah, we got up the next morning

557
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.64
The T like it was nothing we and that's what we did

558
00:43:14.64 --> 00:43:19.20
But then like I said and even now you know when I when I go out and

559
00:43:19.76 --> 00:43:25.36
Hang out with some of my old buddies or actually it's more now when I just when I've gone with and hang out with some of my old buddies

560
00:43:25.48 --> 00:43:29.08
You know we probably don't even you know maybe have a beer but

561
00:43:29.48 --> 00:43:33.32
When I go see the young guys the young guys are getting after I don't look down on them at all

562
00:43:33.32 --> 00:43:35.80
I think you know you're getting after it. I found

563
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.88
I found when I hung out with my buddies that are still serving

564
00:43:40.76 --> 00:43:43.64
You're not in the gig anymore. You're not doing the jobs

565
00:43:43.64 --> 00:43:47.12
You're a little out of shape your your drills are a little rusty maybe or whatever

566
00:43:47.12 --> 00:43:50.16
I find when I'm around guys my age that are still

567
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.08
Operational I can't keep up with them drinking or anything because it's part of the training it's part of the culture

568
00:43:57.08 --> 00:44:02.48
I've fallen off and even like before I was in I didn't really drink and then when I got out

569
00:44:02.48 --> 00:44:05.76
I stopped drinking as much you know and it's not like again guys

570
00:44:05.76 --> 00:44:08.20
We're not joc on iron saying the military we're all

571
00:44:08.84 --> 00:44:13.40
Functional alcoholics what we're saying is it's just what we do and you know

572
00:44:13.40 --> 00:44:17.84
Remember the job that that we volunteer to do we we volunteer to run into gunfire

573
00:44:18.48 --> 00:44:22.84
You know for our countries and for fun like a it's face at a lot of us think it's fun

574
00:44:22.84 --> 00:44:24.44
I thought it was the best time my life

575
00:44:25.04 --> 00:44:30.72
But you still got to blow off that steam and booze is really good at lubricating the you know

576
00:44:30.72 --> 00:44:33.64
The the the the the machinery of blowing off steam

577
00:44:34.24 --> 00:44:37.48
So when I when I started drinking for pain though

578
00:44:37.48 --> 00:44:41.88
Yeah, is where I realized because even the pills bro like let's go back to my pills

579
00:44:41.88 --> 00:44:44.44
I didn't know I was addicted to pills until I watched

580
00:44:45.08 --> 00:44:48.16
Intervention and Billy was addicted to oxy cotton

581
00:44:48.16 --> 00:44:54.28
I was like I said this on the show last time oxy cotton that sounds familiar and I pick up the pill bottle

582
00:44:54.28 --> 00:45:00.20
That's next to me and I go oh I'm an oxy cotton and then they say the doses he takes are this

583
00:45:00.20 --> 00:45:06.04
I'm like I'm on three times the dose he's on and I'm like that's when I went I can get addicted to pills

584
00:45:06.04 --> 00:45:11.40
I get it was so foreign to my brain that doctors said I doctor me and pain

585
00:45:11.40 --> 00:45:16.92
Dr. Go here soldier take this and I go okay and I take it no more pain go fight more you know

586
00:45:16.92 --> 00:45:18.92
That's that's

587
00:45:19.16 --> 00:45:23.88
Going back to alcohol thing is is one more thing for me

588
00:45:23.88 --> 00:45:25.88
I was just about to say this

589
00:45:25.88 --> 00:45:31.10
Was I said hey look went back in the day before the war started it was like nothing else like yes

590
00:45:31.10 --> 00:45:34.72
Nothing better to do it's gonna get drunk now the younger guys

591
00:45:35.24 --> 00:45:37.24
They're smarter than we were and

592
00:45:38.56 --> 00:45:43.64
They've a reason to be they have a reason to be there and they have a reason not to drink they're like hey, bro

593
00:45:43.64 --> 00:45:45.64
I'm gonna go fight a war you know like I want to be in shape

594
00:45:45.64 --> 00:45:47.48
I want to be better. I want to be faster

595
00:45:47.48 --> 00:45:51.92
I don't want to get into fight. I don't want to get a DUI so they're smarter than they are and

596
00:45:51.92 --> 00:45:59.84
That part of the culture is slowly changing and I think it's good. It's awesome. I think it's awesome and I hope it continues

597
00:46:01.28 --> 00:46:06.64
Again, I think it's it got over-emphasized when I first came in over-emphasized in the 90s

598
00:46:06.64 --> 00:46:09.52
It was like but it was a way because we weren't fighting anyone

599
00:46:09.52 --> 00:46:14.32
Exactly, so you drank to be a man then you fight each other and have another platoon shows up

600
00:46:14.32 --> 00:46:18.72
You fight those fucking guys of another squad shows up or another company all right band together

601
00:46:18.72 --> 00:46:22.80
I know we were just fighting, but we'll get back to that. There's a red there's an armored regiment over there

602
00:46:22.80 --> 00:46:27.60
We're gonna go fuck those guys. There's there's something that I've been thinking about on this subject which is

603
00:46:28.88 --> 00:46:34.000
If in the military right and even in life as a human you want to prove that you're ready to

604
00:46:34.24 --> 00:46:40.96
Sacrifice yourself for the cause. I'm willing to make this sacrifice well in a bizarre and

605
00:46:41.52 --> 00:46:43.52
Kind of unfortunate way

606
00:46:43.52 --> 00:46:49.16
Proving to Jody that you know what watch this Jody I'm gonna drink 16

607
00:46:49.16 --> 00:46:53.36
Know your not fire law. You're not. Yes. I'll be in the I don't care. I don't have the part of bitch

608
00:46:53.36 --> 00:46:58.88
And see it go. Oh, then I prove line up 18 line up 18 army versus Navy. Let's go

609
00:46:59.20 --> 00:47:04.48
That's fucking way goes echo echo you played football. Yeah, you were talking about that earlier about

610
00:47:04.48 --> 00:47:08.16
Or on the show I listen to where you take in a shit with no stalls

611
00:47:08.16 --> 00:47:14.000
And you're saying yeah and football we'd rip the doors off the stall. Yeah, oh, yeah, I don't care. Watch me shit

612
00:47:14.40 --> 00:47:16.40
What's what's more out of the words now?

613
00:47:17.12 --> 00:47:19.76
What's more out to happen now is it got to be like hey?

614
00:47:20.64 --> 00:47:22.56
I can clean and jerk, you know

615
00:47:22.56 --> 00:47:28.24
285 what can you get and and so the guys are they're focused on something that fit this now

616
00:47:28.24 --> 00:47:32.000
Yeah, they're focused on their blown out shoulders and yeah, I will talk about that later

617
00:47:32.96 --> 00:47:37.20
But so but I get what you're saying because in the Canadian forces we hadn't had a war

618
00:47:37.20 --> 00:47:43.60
Since Korea yeah, and we had the what combat we had as I was coming in was being downplayed we had guys

619
00:47:44.32 --> 00:47:47.84
Take we had a guy and this is history this is proven

620
00:47:48.24 --> 00:47:54.80
He took an RPG around through his chest like just killed him obviously and everything but his family's told he was killed in a rollover

621
00:47:55.36 --> 00:47:56.96
Because our government was like

622
00:47:57.12 --> 00:48:00.32
They're supposed to be peacekeeping. Where was it in the former Yugoslavia?

623
00:48:00.72 --> 00:48:04.08
I know a guy who took a sniper around through the chest as a tank commander

624
00:48:04.08 --> 00:48:11.44
He was told shut the fuck up take your pension and your benefits got full benefits like it didn't they didn't downplay what you've got

625
00:48:11.44 --> 00:48:19.44
And if you're wounded they just said don't you dare tell anybody we had a we had a unit come home after like fighting some of the most intense combat in Europe since

626
00:48:19.44 --> 00:48:24.48
World War II when the crowads are trying to go through a sir area and ethnicly cleanse

627
00:48:25.20 --> 00:48:29.28
And this is in the 90s when the Canadian like rep for peacekeeping really got

628
00:48:29.28 --> 00:48:36.56
Which was no-in-sense Egypt but came back because our units and the French foreign Legion units were the only units

629
00:48:36.56 --> 00:48:40.08
I were like fuck you were not moving if you're gonna have something cleansed through here

630
00:48:40.08 --> 00:48:46.40
You're going through us whereas all the other UN units ran away and they were in four or five days of like intense combat

631
00:48:46.40 --> 00:48:48.40
bunch of wounded no killed thankfully, but

632
00:48:49.04 --> 00:48:54.08
The government and the and the and the chain of command were like shut your fucking mouths go home like nothing happened

633
00:48:54.08 --> 00:48:55.92
That's real that's real bro

634
00:48:55.92 --> 00:49:00.32
Google may-dak pocket Canadian forces and you'll read all about these

635
00:49:01.04 --> 00:49:07.52
dudes who just like basically were like hanging out drinking coffee smoking butts and telling war stories that they never happened to

636
00:49:07.84 --> 00:49:11.04
Being in a war and going holy shit a buddy of mine

637
00:49:12.64 --> 00:49:18.96
He's gonna get mad at me. He put out a book called shadow keeper or ghost keepers. I'll get the name sorry

638
00:49:18.96 --> 00:49:24.88
And I'll and he was the first Canadian unit him and his unit where the first Canadian unit's in the Bosnia and

639
00:49:24.88 --> 00:49:29.44
The shit they saw and the things they went through and it's a great book by the way ghost keepers

640
00:49:30.96 --> 00:49:35.36
Why would he be mad at you for talking about it? No, no forget in the name room. Oh, okay. Sorry about that

641
00:49:35.92 --> 00:49:37.44
But the point is that

642
00:49:37.44 --> 00:49:44.80
At that time he was told like you don't tell we don't we don't brag is what the line that was told but really the government back home was like

643
00:49:45.44 --> 00:49:47.44
We didn't know this was gonna happen. Well

644
00:49:47.44 --> 00:49:55.04
You don't piece keep without bus and heads. Yeah, like there's a reason if you if I want to go kill that guy and you're in my way

645
00:49:56.32 --> 00:50:01.36
I guess what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna triangle through you, right? Like they they they they this concept of peacekeeping

646
00:50:01.36 --> 00:50:05.44
You know was like you know like the guy with the Billy club. All right, okay, everybody keep it down here

647
00:50:05.44 --> 00:50:09.60
See like that's kind of what the politicians thought that was for college kids sometimes

648
00:50:09.84 --> 00:50:16.72
Yeah, but even then every now and then you smack when over the head with that Billy club like and I think and I remember my first tour in

649
00:50:16.72 --> 00:50:21.44
Kosovo even we train for a crowd control we train for a

650
00:50:22.80 --> 00:50:27.60
Whole lot of things, but then the final training exercises when we all went oh

651
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.24
Because the Russians rolled in and took over the airport and in Kosovo. I don't know if you remember that yeah, and

652
00:50:33.28 --> 00:50:35.28
we did a live training exercise

653
00:50:36.64 --> 00:50:38.64
joint

654
00:50:38.64 --> 00:50:41.28
Armored a full combat team exercise

655
00:50:41.28 --> 00:50:46.88
Like main battle tanks firing and it like I'd never I my dick was rock hard

656
00:50:46.88 --> 00:50:50.04
You were five we've got 500 rounds on each other. We're just like

657
00:50:50.56 --> 00:50:55.28
Blitz flying everywhere and like like range the range control safety was like minimal

658
00:50:55.84 --> 00:50:57.84
Right because they're like trying to simulate real combat

659
00:50:58.72 --> 00:51:04.96
And then we got but anyway the point is that when you don't have anything to point your soldiers at they turn on each other

660
00:51:04.96 --> 00:51:06.96
And that's what we were getting earlier

661
00:51:06.96 --> 00:51:15.36
But to round out the whole like what soldiers board soldiers are danger echo. I think if you've been around a group of active Navy seals

662
00:51:15.36 --> 00:51:20.72
I think or maybe even Army guys like yeah, I think I've nothing else to fight though. Just fight each other. Yeah, like

663
00:51:21.28 --> 00:51:26.96
We used to we used to whenever we were waiting for a plane to go on a trip like this and put my youngest like it would start off with

664
00:51:27.68 --> 00:51:29.28
Okay, let's see you can hit that

665
00:51:29.84 --> 00:51:31.44
Pull over there with a rock

666
00:51:31.44 --> 00:51:33.92
Yeah, right and then all of a sudden it's like okay

667
00:51:33.92 --> 00:51:38.88
Let's see you can hit the light with the rock and then all of a sudden it's hey, let's see you can hit

668
00:51:40.08 --> 00:51:41.36
That car

669
00:51:41.36 --> 00:51:44.40
Tire with a rock and pretty soon your car is it whoever

670
00:51:44.96 --> 00:51:48.56
Just bunch of idiots right and pretty soon you're even a half either having a rock fight

671
00:51:49.12 --> 00:51:54.16
Right, which is which is not smart because you're Hawking rocks is based balls at each other or whatever

672
00:51:54.16 --> 00:51:59.76
Yeah, and yeah, but we were talking about was that the newer guys see how we did it

673
00:52:00.08 --> 00:52:03.04
But they have an enemy though. Yeah, absolutely they have an enemy

674
00:52:03.04 --> 00:52:08.64
We have a perpetual enemy that is not going away and so I see the guys that are in my unit now

675
00:52:09.20 --> 00:52:14.56
They come in and they're like okay, what supplements are gonna keep me at my best exactly like they read my book

676
00:52:14.56 --> 00:52:18.16
They go okay, so Joe the you'd stop drinking coffee how many days before you deployed?

677
00:52:18.16 --> 00:52:22.80
I'd be like well at least five days so it's out of my system because when I'm out there getting after the enemy

678
00:52:23.36 --> 00:52:25.36
I don't want to be having a caffeine crash

679
00:52:25.36 --> 00:52:28.56
But if I need it, I want that piece did you ever get that wake-up gum?

680
00:52:28.56 --> 00:52:35.04
You know in your rats know it's like four cups of coffee in one day or two cups of coffee and like when you need it

681
00:52:35.04 --> 00:52:40.32
Like I would keep that in my pocket till the very end like the heel might be coming to pick us up

682
00:52:40.32 --> 00:52:45.84
And if I didn't take it I was happy but sometimes yeah you take that in the middle of a mission and you're like

683
00:52:46.08 --> 00:52:47.84
Okay, I got two more days in me, right?

684
00:52:47.84 --> 00:52:53.04
But the point is like they have something to aim themselves at right is at the beginning we didn't but even then

685
00:52:53.60 --> 00:52:56.72
Booze wasn't a big deal to me. It was just what we did like you said

686
00:52:56.72 --> 00:53:02.000
Fast forward to this fall that would just pass and I realized I'm crashing

687
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.16
I felt like you were saying you saw something oh you see it because I kind of cut you off

688
00:53:06.16 --> 00:53:08.000
You were talking about seeing the program

689
00:53:08.24 --> 00:53:13.84
Where they show addicted people what's that program called intervention you were seeing the action when I first got wounded

690
00:53:13.84 --> 00:53:16.80
You know seven and that's when I realized I was addicted to the pills

691
00:53:16.80 --> 00:53:22.40
But not addicted like I need a pill it was like my body would just start reacting and I would be like

692
00:53:22.40 --> 00:53:27.68
I'm itchy for some reason and then that's when I started using off and I never took a pill after

693
00:53:27.68 --> 00:53:29.68
Father's day 2011

694
00:53:29.68 --> 00:53:36.08
But even that you read the book I ended up buying pills from a guy in an alley once and I went what the fuck is it like

695
00:53:36.72 --> 00:53:41.20
And the system has treat me like an asshole because I want more pills and then they're like yeah

696
00:53:41.60 --> 00:53:44.16
If you want more pills you got to come to the hospital every day to get your dose

697
00:53:44.16 --> 00:53:50.16
I'm like well not a fucking junky dog. I just don't the dose you're giving me isn't enough to keep me from feeling like shit

698
00:53:50.16 --> 00:53:53.28
And like and then I'm mitigating my stress with the pills

699
00:53:53.60 --> 00:53:57.60
So maybe okay, so go to more therapy and that's when I started rebuilding in 2011

700
00:53:58.08 --> 00:54:00.72
So come the fall I'm still not on my legs. I

701
00:54:01.44 --> 00:54:03.44
I wait this is 2011

702
00:54:03.44 --> 00:54:07.60
2011 when I quit the pills got it and that's why I thought booze wouldn't be a problem

703
00:54:07.92 --> 00:54:10.56
cigarettes are in a problem booze isn't a problem you'd put a problem

704
00:54:10.56 --> 00:54:12.56
I mean you'd quit pills whatever

705
00:54:13.04 --> 00:54:17.28
It was like a whatever when the time comes for you to quit booze you have to quit that's what you were thinking when I'm ready

706
00:54:17.28 --> 00:54:24.40
I'll be done with it and but what I what what happened and if you're a politician the most important thing federal

707
00:54:25.20 --> 00:54:26.48
state

708
00:54:26.48 --> 00:54:29.52
Municipal so can't have state would be provincial

709
00:54:30.24 --> 00:54:35.68
Budget money money is the big thing that everybody worries about in private life and everything else so

710
00:54:36.64 --> 00:54:41.36
So if what when are we talking about right now? Sorry you're already bat your back now. I'm bouncing around a bit

711
00:54:41.36 --> 00:54:43.12
I'm just saying in my mind

712
00:54:43.12 --> 00:54:44.64
2017

713
00:54:44.64 --> 00:54:46.64
wasn't that big a deal

714
00:54:46.64 --> 00:54:52.96
as far as the drinking because I'd kicked all these other habits and I

715
00:54:53.36 --> 00:54:58.72
Whether it's real or not I had an army psychologist once tell me I had an anti-addictive personality

716
00:54:59.36 --> 00:55:03.36
Because I guess like you like to me. It's like okay. Well, what's gonna help me function better

717
00:55:03.84 --> 00:55:07.84
What's gonna get me to the next day without too many issues and if I want to have a few drinks

718
00:55:07.84 --> 00:55:11.76
I'm gonna have a few drinks and I can because tomorrow morning. I don't have to be anywhere until 9 a.m. anyway

719
00:55:12.16 --> 00:55:15.76
So whatever if I'm a little hungover when I get there. I'll have a coffee and a glass of water

720
00:55:15.76 --> 00:55:18.72
Or a gatorade and an advil not a big deal

721
00:55:20.40 --> 00:55:24.40
Fast forward to again my daughter's birthday in the last fall

722
00:55:25.20 --> 00:55:29.68
Oh daddy can't be there yet because I'm almost still hungover right? I got my cup

723
00:55:29.68 --> 00:55:36.48
And I and I was when I realized I'm going through I was like I felt this before because I kept asking myself

724
00:55:36.48 --> 00:55:42.96
What the why do I keep screwing everything up and then the budget's processed started that's where I was going with this and that's where

725
00:55:42.96 --> 00:55:48.96
I remembered I'm not because you're not a private citizen anymore. You know that right? What do you mean?

726
00:55:49.84 --> 00:55:55.12
Well, if you fell off Instagram tomorrow there's a million people out there it probably like where the fuck is Jacco

727
00:55:56.72 --> 00:56:01.60
And I was toasting less I was being less upbeat in what I did post

728
00:56:02.16 --> 00:56:05.60
The few last couple podcasts even going back to the spring

729
00:56:05.60 --> 00:56:12.16
On one of them we got loaded and we said it was for fun, but I like I needed a drink myself

730
00:56:13.28 --> 00:56:14.32
Um

731
00:56:14.32 --> 00:56:22.32
And I'm starting to miss budget and budget is money that's what everything runs on the city of Ottawa has a three and a half billion dollar budget

732
00:56:23.12 --> 00:56:28.24
Why is in counts are minic at the budget meeting for the community protective services committee

733
00:56:29.12 --> 00:56:31.12
Community protective services committee. Oh

734
00:56:31.12 --> 00:56:36.000
He's not feeling well his legs are bugging him stuff like whatever my staff said

735
00:56:36.40 --> 00:56:41.44
I'm tell they're asking me what's going on boss? And I'm like yeah, I just need to buy me some time

736
00:56:41.60 --> 00:56:44.88
But that's when the media and the voter goes no no no no

737
00:56:45.68 --> 00:56:52.64
We get it you like the right books and you like to do podcasts you like to shoot guns and you know you're a dude and we accept you as who you are

738
00:56:52.64 --> 00:56:58.80
But our four-year commitment the biggest part of that commitment is making sure the money is spent properly

739
00:56:58.80 --> 00:57:02.52
And on the things that we want it spent on and we elected you to be that voice

740
00:57:03.20 --> 00:57:05.20
Why aren't you at that meeting and

741
00:57:07.28 --> 00:57:13.28
Personal private matters can only get you so far during like the most important part of your job, right?

742
00:57:13.68 --> 00:57:16.56
Well, either go on medical leave or be at the meeting is

743
00:57:17.20 --> 00:57:20.32
Basically what I was told right get a doctor's note or be here and

744
00:57:21.36 --> 00:57:26.72
That's when I ended up doing that radio interview in December when it really came to a head

745
00:57:26.72 --> 00:57:29.52
And when I had to really admit to myself like I'm

746
00:57:30.24 --> 00:57:33.04
border I think I was in my mind I was borderline

747
00:57:34.32 --> 00:57:36.32
alcoholic I guess

748
00:57:38.24 --> 00:57:40.24
But I was I was just not

749
00:57:40.88 --> 00:57:43.52
able to deal with that failure in myself

750
00:57:44.16 --> 00:57:51.76
How much how much were you drinking at the peak? It was a 40 ounce of whatever I get my hands on sometimes

751
00:57:51.76 --> 00:57:52.88
It was like two

752
00:57:52.88 --> 00:58:00.24
Remember one time it was two 26 ounce bottles of rye of crown royal with my branded choice and if that wasn't around

753
00:58:01.04 --> 00:58:04.72
Again jacked in and you're drinking you're getting down with work and that's it

754
00:58:04.88 --> 00:58:08.88
Just no at this point. I just waking up in the morning and drinking okay not even on a work

755
00:58:09.68 --> 00:58:15.28
Like I was just I knew in the morning I couldn't go and then you feel like shit because you drank all day

756
00:58:15.84 --> 00:58:20.16
So what do you do? You go for the hair of the dog and that just turns into a perpetual circle and

757
00:58:20.16 --> 00:58:25.36
Then the wounds I was talking about earlier. They're not healing because my body's full of alcohol

758
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.80
And a friend of mine said you know what my dad used to have that problem because he drank too much too

759
00:58:31.12 --> 00:58:33.12
And he would like cut his hand working on like

760
00:58:33.44 --> 00:58:39.36
Woodwork in the shed and it would be there for like six eight nine months and then he'd sober up for a couple months and then it would go away

761
00:58:39.36 --> 00:58:41.36
But then he'd fall back and I went

762
00:58:41.92 --> 00:58:46.000
Your dad the maniac you've told me stories about and she was like yeah, and I'm like

763
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:53.12
Okay, so this is really becoming a problem. So now I'm dealing with the internal struggle of I'm a complete failure of a human being

764
00:58:53.52 --> 00:58:58.80
I've met failed my kids. I failed the voters. I failed like friends of mine like jacco and echo who

765
00:58:59.68 --> 00:59:05.84
You know we expect certain things from each other, right? Are we think we do and you could you could have a terrible day

766
00:59:05.84 --> 00:59:09.20
And I would never judge you for it, but you don't know that until it happens, right?

767
00:59:09.76 --> 00:59:12.24
And even if you know that you still don't want to

768
00:59:13.20 --> 00:59:14.24
admit it

769
00:59:14.24 --> 00:59:17.76
Never mind to jacco or echo how about to yourself

770
00:59:18.72 --> 00:59:24.88
Right and again I'd stop meditating. I'd stop going to my therapist. I'd stop going to the gym. I'd stop podcasting

771
00:59:24.88 --> 00:59:30.56
I'd stop writing really even though and then during the book tour in October and I know I'm rewinding a little bit

772
00:59:30.56 --> 00:59:33.84
But I the last thing I wanted to do is go on the book tour

773
00:59:34.48 --> 00:59:39.36
But the book is coming out and that's a commitment that I signed and you know you're dealing with all this and I

774
00:59:39.44 --> 00:59:43.12
And I did the tour in my wheelchair and everybody's like oh you're doing so much better

775
00:59:43.12 --> 00:59:49.44
Because you're okay with being in the wheelchair and I think yeah, yeah cool close the hotel room door and like open a drink right have a drink

776
00:59:51.12 --> 00:59:53.12
So

777
00:59:53.12 --> 00:59:58.88
December was the worst month of my life getting blown up was easy in my opinion dealing with this shit

778
00:59:59.52 --> 01:00:04.72
But what I didn't do in 2007 was actually deal with the fact that I was blown up

779
01:00:05.44 --> 01:00:10.48
Frankly I was so like yeah recover be useful to the regiment be useful to the queen

780
01:00:10.48 --> 01:00:12.48
Be better for the country

781
01:00:13.36 --> 01:00:18.40
Put prosthetic legs on life is normal ish and then now I'm like okay

782
01:00:18.96 --> 01:00:20.96
First of all now dude you're 40

783
01:00:21.52 --> 01:00:27.44
Second of all you you have kids that are now like worth of like I would see them and they be like

784
01:00:28.08 --> 01:00:31.04
We miss you like where have you been like why aren't you?

785
01:00:31.84 --> 01:00:35.84
Around more and like you just you don't live far away like what's your excuse?

786
01:00:36.32 --> 01:00:38.48
because oh because I'm ashamed of you seeing me all

787
01:00:38.48 --> 01:00:44.24
Dealing with the next day of being drunk and stuff you know and egg and it really it really

788
01:00:45.52 --> 01:00:51.44
It really became I understand now I've always been sympathetic to addicts since my oxy cotton days

789
01:00:51.44 --> 01:00:57.28
But now I get how depression can really make you into

790
01:01:01.52 --> 01:01:03.52
Someone not worth saving in your own mind

791
01:01:03.52 --> 01:01:07.52
And I get it and I've never

792
01:01:08.72 --> 01:01:10.48
Dis I've never thought

793
01:01:11.52 --> 01:01:20.24
Hatefully or anything of friends that have committed suicide or have gone down that path of depression that you just if you're not in it

794
01:01:20.24 --> 01:01:27.44
You don't get it and you go man. I can't you just like read a book or listen to some comedy or not drink today like have

795
01:01:27.84 --> 01:01:31.04
I'll sit with you and have a water and you just don't get it

796
01:01:31.04 --> 01:01:38.08
And I was doing a lot of this on my self isolation too because you don't want anyone seeing you like this and then

797
01:01:38.64 --> 01:01:41.84
The few people that do hang around are often in the same

798
01:01:43.36 --> 01:01:48.96
In one of the levels of of fuck up of life fuck up and so

799
01:01:49.36 --> 01:01:53.76
You know, I've talked about this before where and it sounds like you're describing exactly

800
01:01:53.76 --> 01:01:57.76
I talk about how like people get into a place where they're basically in a storm, right?

801
01:01:57.76 --> 01:02:01.92
There there's a storm all around their head and no matter which direction they look

802
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.88
They just see clouds and thunder and rain and horror, right?

803
01:02:05.60 --> 01:02:10.08
And everybody that's outside that storm looks at him and they go, yeah you're in the storm

804
01:02:10.08 --> 01:02:13.04
Just come over here and you'll be out of the storm. Just move over here and you'll be out of the storm

805
01:02:13.04 --> 01:02:17.04
Yeah, just put down the drink or you know start working out again or whatever

806
01:02:17.12 --> 01:02:18.80
You just move over here and you'll be out of the storm

807
01:02:18.80 --> 01:02:24.000
Yeah, but but that person can't see they can't see the direction everything around them is a storm

808
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.32
They don't understand how me coming over there is like climbing a mountain

809
01:02:29.52 --> 01:02:33.36
And not to give anyone shit, but maybe a little bit of shit if you know who you are

810
01:02:34.16 --> 01:02:39.36
Hey man, I want to watch you have seen tonight at my place. Yeah, cool except hey bro

811
01:02:39.36 --> 01:02:42.56
I'm in a wheelchair. I can't even get in your front door

812
01:02:43.04 --> 01:02:49.92
Can you come to my place where I can get around and take a piss without getting out of water bottle and you know like being embarrassed in front of your wife

813
01:02:51.04 --> 01:02:53.04
Yeah, but you live all the way over there like

814
01:02:53.04 --> 01:02:57.28
We've already got plans and shit like well cool. What about next weekend?

815
01:02:59.04 --> 01:03:04.40
That kind of that didn't help as well because people like they don't like even coming here

816
01:03:04.40 --> 01:03:07.84
You're like oh, I'll just buddy carry up the stairs and I'm like yeah, I trust you

817
01:03:07.84 --> 01:03:11.04
But at the same time like some of my friends offering to carry me into their house

818
01:03:11.04 --> 01:03:13.44
They're like 140 pounds like soaking wet

819
01:03:13.84 --> 01:03:19.84
Never been lifted away in their life and nothing against them, but it's like you want me to trust my physical safety

820
01:03:20.40 --> 01:03:22.40
Or you could just come to my place

821
01:03:22.40 --> 01:03:26.08
Like like and they don't get it and I don't I'm not mad anyone about it

822
01:03:26.08 --> 01:03:30.08
It's like it's like that saying like I don't hate them about it, but at the same time it's kind of like

823
01:03:30.64 --> 01:03:35.76
All right cool man. I'll just watch the fight and we can text and I'll be at my place alone again

824
01:03:36.24 --> 01:03:39.44
Right like because I didn't leave my dog isn't at the place where I'm out right now, right?

825
01:03:40.32 --> 01:03:45.28
So that all thing just kind of fell into a big blender and in December

826
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
How long did that?

827
01:03:48.80 --> 01:03:51.52
So did this when you got back in your wheelchair

828
01:03:51.52 --> 01:03:56.48
Yeah, you gave up the legs. Yeah, that's really this may it's so in me when you get like I said to you

829
01:03:56.48 --> 01:03:58.88
We went a lot long trip you went to Albany you come back from that

830
01:03:59.68 --> 01:04:05.76
Now you're now you're like I'm done with my prosthetics. They're freaking killing me. Yeah, and I'm getting in a wheelchair

831
01:04:06.64 --> 01:04:11.76
Back in the wheelchair is that sort of like now you're just you're now you're just gaining momentum going downhill

832
01:04:12.08 --> 01:04:16.08
I yeah, well then, but that's a crazy thing is I thought I'm starting to climb up

833
01:04:16.08 --> 01:04:22.80
Because I'm like finally admitting I can't wear my prosthetics because I would like walk into council

834
01:04:23.76 --> 01:04:27.84
Which is the big like every two weeks you do the big meeting and that's where all like all

835
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.20
Everything you went to the bar and drank about and then went to the office and like I argued behind the scenes of each other

836
01:04:33.20 --> 01:04:39.04
Now you sit down and you go all those in favor. I all those against the you know, nay and then it's past all

837
01:04:39.28 --> 01:04:43.12
Resolution passes and now it's a legal de-dice cream on bank street on Sundays

838
01:04:43.12 --> 01:04:48.000
Which is a bylaw and Ottawa that I'm gonna actually try and get changed by the way from like 1800s

839
01:04:48.16 --> 01:04:50.80
But the point is that's the big show

840
01:04:51.12 --> 01:04:54.76
Like if all the other training right like that's the live fire exercise

841
01:04:54.76 --> 01:04:57.76
Or that's the actual op right so that's what you're work for

842
01:04:58.12 --> 01:05:03.84
So when I started missing those at the end of the year when we're pat like the budget is the thing that if without budget

843
01:05:03.84 --> 01:05:10.000
You have you guys just had a government shutdown over budget. Yep. That's you're trying to avoid and that's when the media who

844
01:05:10.56 --> 01:05:11.96
You know, they're doing their job

845
01:05:11.96 --> 01:05:18.28
But joddy-middick in a headline gets clicks and now joddy-middick the guy everybody loves oh

846
01:05:18.48 --> 01:05:23.08
He's fucking up what's going on here one guy even made a video called no show-middick

847
01:05:23.72 --> 01:05:25.84
Because I'd miss like four or five meetings

848
01:05:25.84 --> 01:05:31.96
But the meetings I'd missed were the ones out like you could miss every other meeting throughout the year and nobody would give a

849
01:05:32.32 --> 01:05:34.32
Fine fuck of a rolling donut

850
01:05:35.44 --> 01:05:38.12
Which is a saying out of a book a series of books. I love but

851
01:05:38.12 --> 01:05:44.08
But I miss these three meetings. Oh, no, oh, no, man like these are the meetings

852
01:05:44.08 --> 01:05:50.60
We really voted for you to be at where you at no show-middick and this guy is trying to make it a name from self as a political commentator

853
01:05:50.60 --> 01:05:52.60
Whatever he's a nice whole but the point is

854
01:05:54.32 --> 01:05:56.32
Say that shit to my face

855
01:05:56.72 --> 01:05:58.32
the point is

856
01:05:58.32 --> 01:05:59.72
He's right though

857
01:05:59.72 --> 01:06:03.52
Where is no show-middick and now in my because that's what I wasn't my head already

858
01:06:03.52 --> 01:06:09.72
Right and then I'm like okay, so I thought if I said personal family matters or personal health matters

859
01:06:09.72 --> 01:06:11.34
They get it they know me they know I've

860
01:06:11.68 --> 01:06:16.72
Dealing with stuff along the way, but they're like yeah, we get it man, but if you don't tell us what's going on

861
01:06:16.72 --> 01:06:21.28
And we're gonna assume you're just fucking late being lazy because why don't why shouldn't we?

862
01:06:22.28 --> 01:06:28.72
And I went okay and a reporter buddy in mine and I sent you a couple of texts that's when I and I when you said that earlier

863
01:06:28.72 --> 01:06:32.40
I my skin went like you know we got the goose bump because I

864
01:06:32.40 --> 01:06:36.20
Forgot I sent that and I was starting to think like okay

865
01:06:36.20 --> 01:06:42.48
I got to go back to basics. I got to remember who I am and what I was and my own advice and

866
01:06:42.88 --> 01:06:51.80
That's when I went oh yeah, I got too comfortable in my pity in the enemy now is on my left flank and I have zero defenses on the left flank

867
01:06:52.56 --> 01:06:56.76
And what do you instead of fighting a shitty losing rear guard?

868
01:06:56.76 --> 01:07:05.60
You turn and you face the fucking you face the battle so I turned and a reporter friend of mine and first for the record

869
01:07:05.76 --> 01:07:10.24
Reporters are not really friends those friends that you kind of keep at arms length and you're always ready to punch

870
01:07:10.24 --> 01:07:14.48
But you never know right you're not really punch, but I'm not threatening anyone with violence

871
01:07:14.48 --> 01:07:20.56
You PC world weirdos, but he's he called me on a personal note and he said hey man

872
01:07:20.56 --> 01:07:28.98
Here's what's being said in the in the media world about you and this is what could be going to headline if you don't say anything soon

873
01:07:29.48 --> 01:07:31.48
And I went okay, well

874
01:07:31.48 --> 01:07:37.50
Some of that's true some of that's made up, but that's what you do when you don't know and I said all right

875
01:07:37.50 --> 01:07:39.92
Uh, can I come on your show and he's like well

876
01:07:39.92 --> 01:07:44.60
That's what I was just about to ask you if you want come on my show and that's Evan and

877
01:07:44.60 --> 01:07:50.92
We and then we went and we talked about it and he was very kind to me. He's rough. He's a tough dude. He's a tough

878
01:07:52.08 --> 01:07:54.08
Reporter, but at the same time very fair

879
01:07:54.08 --> 01:07:58.88
And he hit me with a few with a few hits and I hit him back

880
01:07:58.88 --> 01:08:04.78
But what I did was I got it all out of my system because it's basically you feel like you're holding never mind

881
01:08:04.78 --> 01:08:06.78
I'm keeping a secret from Jaco and Echo

882
01:08:07.56 --> 01:08:12.52
I'm keeping a secret from 40,000 residents who trust me to be their counselor

883
01:08:12.52 --> 01:08:16.62
Then there's all the fans of Jodi medic that are out there and all the supporters

884
01:08:17.20 --> 01:08:20.12
Who are all amazing and who all are willing to

885
01:08:20.44 --> 01:08:26.04
Support you through the best and the worst of times, but they can't support you without anything that they like

886
01:08:27.04 --> 01:08:31.92
To them I just stopped podcasting for no reason and I've stopped being positive on social media

887
01:08:31.92 --> 01:08:39.28
So what like what did you just decide is this the real Jodi now? Is that who like are you faking it before like that's some of the messages

888
01:08:39.28 --> 01:08:43.70
I got like oh obviously you figured out that you can still make money and be be the asshole

889
01:08:43.70 --> 01:08:50.58
You actually are and I was like oh shit Jesus maybe I am that asshole, but when I did my buddy's show a

890
01:08:51.10 --> 01:08:54.60
Huge weight went off my shoulders. I shouldn't say buddy, but you know

891
01:08:54.60 --> 01:09:00.36
But the point is that that was the beginning of me turning into the into the fight instead of running and

892
01:09:00.96 --> 01:09:07.000
I had a couple setbacks so so hold on so this show that you did and you you said you listen

893
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:14.20
I did listen to it, but the the the premise of the show was what you did for lack of a better word

894
01:09:14.20 --> 01:09:16.20
As you took ownership of everything that was going on I

895
01:09:16.84 --> 01:09:20.60
Even laughed I was laughing right before I went online. I went under the show

896
01:09:20.60 --> 01:09:25.36
I said I'm doing a job on I'm taking extreme ownership. You went on your own

897
01:09:25.52 --> 01:09:32.18
So you went on there and you said like a baby by the way anyone who's been tough guy I've been drinking too much

898
01:09:32.18 --> 01:09:35.000
Yeah, what do you like what were the facts?

899
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:41.44
What were the things that you took ownership of was that that was the major thing right well the the booze caused a lot of the

900
01:09:42.24 --> 01:09:45.68
lack of energy lack of a tentative

901
01:09:46.52 --> 01:09:49.76
attendance went down because it's one thing to be

902
01:09:50.48 --> 01:09:57.56
Buzz it's another thing to be completely hung over and fucked up and show up for meeting like you you know yourself

903
01:09:57.56 --> 01:10:01.44
I know myself and I know like if I go in there like this right now people will be like

904
01:10:02.12 --> 01:10:03.64
He is completely

905
01:10:03.64 --> 01:10:06.66
Fucked right and I know I'm swurring a lot and I apologize, but

906
01:10:08.04 --> 01:10:10.28
You avoid that and then so I said okay guys

907
01:10:10.28 --> 01:10:14.64
Well here's why I missed this meeting and here's why I missed that meeting because I've turned to an old friend

908
01:10:14.92 --> 01:10:20.80
Crown Royal instead of my my therapist and my doctors and my friends and my family and my supporters

909
01:10:20.80 --> 01:10:26.12
And all the things that made me able to cope from 2007 to 2017

910
01:10:26.40 --> 01:10:31.28
So for basically a decade I forgot about and I left behind like

911
01:10:31.28 --> 01:10:38.52
Never my I was never my engine like stopped the gym stop talking my therapist stopped talking to my kid

912
01:10:38.52 --> 01:10:42.04
Stop talking to my ex stop talking to my mom stop talking to my dad

913
01:10:42.92 --> 01:10:45.92
my friends again. I was self-isolating and

914
01:10:47.64 --> 01:10:51.64
There were times when I'd want to pick up the phone and just call it you or Rob or

915
01:10:52.64 --> 01:10:58.20
Or some of my friends at home or some of my sniper buddies and just be like I don't know what to do

916
01:10:58.20 --> 01:11:05.64
And now you're man echo right sure imagine trying to make that call

917
01:11:05.64 --> 01:11:10.68
Yeah, and I'm not saying it's a man problem. I'm saying it's a shit definitely a human problem

918
01:11:11.96 --> 01:11:19.80
But I'm the guy everybody thinks I get told you're the poster child of success post injury and I'm like in my head

919
01:11:19.80 --> 01:11:25.52
I'm like I'm like I'm a fucking bullshit or like that's how you feel and I'm like whether I am or not

920
01:11:25.52 --> 01:11:30.28
I've been lucky and I've made a few decent decisions on for my own accord

921
01:11:30.28 --> 01:11:39.32
And I am where I am through hard work and discipline and now what and now I feel like I'm losing it all because I have I have I've been faking it

922
01:11:39.68 --> 01:11:46.04
Was this just a ride that I was on and now I'm done and I want to get off like the thing the things that go through your head

923
01:11:46.44 --> 01:11:50.60
Now first of all I was never suicidal right never thought never crossed my mind

924
01:11:50.60 --> 01:11:53.40
I don't know why it just didn't but I

925
01:11:53.40 --> 01:11:58.88
I did have one thought one day where I went I think I understand why some guys take that path though

926
01:11:58.88 --> 01:12:06.08
I had such a day one day where it was in December and I it wasn't like I thought oh, it things would be better if I was dead

927
01:12:06.08 --> 01:12:09.04
It was like I just I was such a little moment and I went

928
01:12:10.44 --> 01:12:17.64
I think I get it why sometimes guys take that path because it's just like you know like it was just such an extreme

929
01:12:17.64 --> 01:12:24.20
Combination of everything from all sides and I went I think I kind of get it now because before I I don't know

930
01:12:24.20 --> 01:12:28.56
But you but I've tried to figure a why some of the guys go with that route and I just can't

931
01:12:29.12 --> 01:12:34.52
But that moment I went okay. I kind of get it and it was it wasn't like I thought

932
01:12:35.04 --> 01:12:42.52
Solution for myself, but I I just there visit very quick. It was took about two minutes of in and out and it stuck with me though because I went

933
01:12:42.52 --> 01:12:49.68
That's the first time I've ever had any thought like that right and then so my daughter's birthday is late December

934
01:12:49.68 --> 01:12:53.20
and I miss that one too and then

935
01:12:55.76 --> 01:12:57.76
New year's Eve and

936
01:12:57.76 --> 01:13:01.68
I've already made plans to go and do an

937
01:13:02.20 --> 01:13:05.86
Assessment that would tell me how terrible of an addict I am as

938
01:13:05.86 --> 01:13:12.78
As an alcoholic because that's what you are you're an addict and I'm going to a kind of sort of and

939
01:13:14.14 --> 01:13:20.46
My husband who's all over me. He's a great guy and I won't say his name here, but he knows who he is and he's a beautiful human being

940
01:13:21.78 --> 01:13:27.18
And he's trying to get on top of me and Luke's trying to get on top of me and my mom and my ex and my friends

941
01:13:27.18 --> 01:13:30.06
And they're all trying to just be like okay man like we get it now. We've heard

942
01:13:30.06 --> 01:13:36.54
We've heard your calls loud and clear and how do we help you and then it's trying to like mitigate that and then

943
01:13:37.26 --> 01:13:39.90
Well, it's you know, it's Christmas. I'll have a few drinks

944
01:13:40.90 --> 01:13:46.18
I know I told the world this, but you know I can handle it. I'm not I'm not that bad and then the next morning

945
01:13:46.18 --> 01:13:52.20
You're like oh man, but the New Year's Eve I had some company that came out because they're like we heard you

946
01:13:52.20 --> 01:13:55.42
Man, we're here. It's New Year's Eve. Let's hang out. Let's be so tough fun

947
01:13:55.42 --> 01:14:02.38
We'll have a few drinks. We're all here to keep an eye on you can't get that bad. We know who you are and the next morning. It's like I

948
01:14:02.86 --> 01:14:04.54
Did what?

949
01:14:04.54 --> 01:14:10.70
Because now all the pressures on now to get better and I was here in radio interviews where there

950
01:14:10.70 --> 01:14:13.10
I was headline news and Ottawa for a couple days

951
01:14:13.66 --> 01:14:16.58
Where they went. Wow real brave of him to say that now

952
01:14:16.70 --> 01:14:19.92
How's he gonna get better guys are talking about me? I have to retire our

953
01:14:19.92 --> 01:14:29.76
Our resigned from politics and Canada with the gun laws as they are a public said anyone can call in a threat on anybody who owns guns

954
01:14:30.48 --> 01:14:32.48
Right so some

955
01:14:33.08 --> 01:14:35.84
Gun hating citizen and I'm not

956
01:14:36.24 --> 01:14:38.56
hating them for this. I'm just hating them for being a dick

957
01:14:39.04 --> 01:14:46.000
Said oh I can get a prominent gun owners guns taken away if I call the police and say I think he's a threat to public safety

958
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.80
And that's all you have to do it's completely anonymous which is bullshit and anyone can do it against anyone got to gun owner

959
01:14:53.52 --> 01:14:58.48
And so now the police call and they say listen we have to do investigation so like

960
01:14:58.48 --> 01:15:02.08
So that actually happened so this was this was right before New Year's Eve

961
01:15:02.08 --> 01:15:06.16
So I'm like freaking out. I am losing my shit and

962
01:15:06.56 --> 01:15:10.56
Because I'm like I don't know how it works now they're very understanding but they have to do the check

963
01:15:10.56 --> 01:15:12.72
They look once the investigation started

964
01:15:12.72 --> 01:15:14.72
Real or not or

965
01:15:15.60 --> 01:15:20.04
Substantiate it or not we got to go through steps one to Z

966
01:15:20.72 --> 01:15:26.56
Okay, so they go and inspect the guns they have the guns are safe the guns are where they're supposed to be everything's locked

967
01:15:26.56 --> 01:15:27.60
I have everything's proper

968
01:15:27.60 --> 01:15:29.60
Dutata to talk to my family

969
01:15:30.16 --> 01:15:32.64
Nope, he's never been threatening with them. They're la la la

970
01:15:32.64 --> 01:15:38.000
And then like and then and then and then the New Year's Eve rolls around and I have that's terrible

971
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.44
This is the last I'd the last drop of booze I had was New Year's Eve

972
01:15:41.44 --> 01:15:43.44
And

973
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.76
We started with a small bottle and I drank it all myself and

974
01:15:50.08 --> 01:15:56.40
This past me you're easy just past New Year's Eve like so towards today 2024 to go 23 days ago and

975
01:15:57.12 --> 01:16:02.96
The next morning I got a little bit of a lowdown about what I was like and I call him evil jodie

976
01:16:03.44 --> 01:16:05.44
And he came out once in

977
01:16:05.68 --> 01:16:07.68
2000 and

978
01:16:07.68 --> 01:16:13.44
five after my first deployment to Afghanistan and before my second one where I got wounded

979
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.32
And I was bouncing at the time and I was you know having some a little bit too much fun in life

980
01:16:18.32 --> 01:16:24.72
Maybe but I was also drinking too much for the wrong reasons at the time and a lot of us work as we had

981
01:16:25.68 --> 01:16:31.76
The K and forces we hadn't dealt with you know combat a lot right like I said and a lot of us were green

982
01:16:32.24 --> 01:16:34.56
When we went into Afghanistan the first time so

983
01:16:34.56 --> 01:16:40.56
Maybe a lot of mid like you said a fair number of us me included were maybe

984
01:16:41.20 --> 01:16:43.20
choosing the wrong ways

985
01:16:43.92 --> 01:16:49.20
I was still meditating a lot so mitigated a little bit but this I called him evil jodie he came out

986
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.16
My friend my one one of my buddies who

987
01:16:53.20 --> 01:16:58.16
Still talk to he's a police sniper now, but he keep pulled me aside and he said hey man like

988
01:16:58.16 --> 01:17:05.12
I've never ever seen you actually that ever no matter how drunk you were what it was going on or how angry you were

989
01:17:05.36 --> 01:17:08.64
Who pissed you off what the fuck was that about and I went oh

990
01:17:09.68 --> 01:17:12.48
That sounds like grandpa or whatever

991
01:17:13.04 --> 01:17:16.08
So I locked him in a cage and I used to joke that you know

992
01:17:16.64 --> 01:17:22.72
Don't let the cave man out of his cage and then but that night so the 25 days ago or whatever was he got out

993
01:17:22.72 --> 01:17:28.24
And I didn't hurt anybody and or anything and but I said things you don't shouldn't and I maybe

994
01:17:30.48 --> 01:17:37.84
Made actions that you shouldn't yeah for me the biggest thing is when you you realize that you had no control over what's happening

995
01:17:37.84 --> 01:17:43.84
And yeah, well, that's what I'm saying. I don't remember I did all these things. I said what to who?

996
01:17:45.12 --> 01:17:49.84
Oh my god, and you're just like you're saying I and I called so I called one of the people that was there

997
01:17:49.84 --> 01:17:55.04
And I said I am so sorry and he was like been there done that dude you got to get your shit together

998
01:17:55.28 --> 01:17:58.08
I'll be here when you're done when you're ready or I'm here tomorrow

999
01:17:58.40 --> 01:18:06.32
He was such a great guy about it and I went oh so the world doesn't hate you for being a fuck up and I that helped too

1000
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.80
And we talked about this last night like who when you mitigate

1001
01:18:12.08 --> 01:18:14.88
Crisis David Letterman or Tiger Woods

1002
01:18:15.20 --> 01:18:19.20
Whoever like don't follow Tiger Woods book go with David Letterman

1003
01:18:19.20 --> 01:18:21.76
Oh, and explain what David Letterman did because I didn't

1004
01:18:21.76 --> 01:18:28.80
So yeah, so it in in in in in a nutshell David Letterman got he got cotton affair on his wife

1005
01:18:28.80 --> 01:18:32.88
David Letterman by the way is a is like a talk show host at night and

1006
01:18:33.36 --> 01:18:38.48
Well, you watch yeah, he's not anymore, but I guess he was and he was pretty popular at some point

1007
01:18:38.48 --> 01:18:43.84
Yeah, he was our individual. Some people don't know is a golf player so he yeah

1008
01:18:43.84 --> 01:18:49.36
If you haven't heard of him he's like yeah, he's like half black half tie and you know you

1009
01:18:49.36 --> 01:18:56.08
Swung a golf club pretty good for minute, but he got caught cheating on his wife too, but so David Letterman got a

1010
01:18:56.80 --> 01:19:01.60
Blackmail letter right before one of his shows and the guy said I know what happened

1011
01:19:01.60 --> 01:19:06.48
That it had a you haven't affair or something he had had one or he was having one and

1012
01:19:07.84 --> 01:19:11.12
It was like pay me $40,000 a week for the rest of my life or

1013
01:19:11.12 --> 01:19:14.96
Dis or something I'll tell the world and David Letterman went

1014
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.92
All right, I fucked up and he went out and he's and I don't remember

1015
01:19:19.92 --> 01:19:24.96
I did see it, but I don't remember exactly how it went, but basically usually they do a monologue

1016
01:19:24.96 --> 01:19:27.76
These guys before they're showing he went instead of today's monologue

1017
01:19:27.76 --> 01:19:31.44
I'm gonna look into the camera and I'm gonna say I cheated on my wife and

1018
01:19:32.40 --> 01:19:37.44
She knows about it and we're working on it and somebody else found out and they thought they were gonna get money from me

1019
01:19:37.44 --> 01:19:44.40
So he looked in the camera and he went fuck you the police are coming to tear house right now and to the rest of you I apologize

1020
01:19:44.40 --> 01:19:49.44
I'm sorry I'm sorry I might have to my wife I apologize and I understand if this is a problem for us

1021
01:19:49.44 --> 01:19:51.44
So then we're all have to deal with it again

1022
01:19:51.84 --> 01:19:56.08
Because of who I am it's world news and he he owned it

1023
01:19:56.56 --> 01:19:58.56
He owned all of it and

1024
01:19:58.56 --> 01:20:06.64
The other day he interviewed this guy named Obama you might have heard of him on his new show on Netflix called I forget what the next guest or something

1025
01:20:07.60 --> 01:20:16.000
And he was on he's he still seen as a good dude right because he owned it and he and he worked through it and he and he didn't not talk about it

1026
01:20:17.04 --> 01:20:20.64
And then there's what Tiger Woods did which is run away hide

1027
01:20:20.64 --> 01:20:28.16
Not admitted anything and Tiger Woods went through four or five years of just complete chaos in his life

1028
01:20:28.72 --> 01:20:34.32
Before he finally even I think now he still places in the bottom 50 I think he's at the PGA

1029
01:20:34.32 --> 01:20:35.52
I don't know I don't know

1030
01:20:35.52 --> 01:20:43.12
He still plays but he probably just plays the pay the bills now. He was worth a billion dollars at one point and he lost at all because of not owning a fuck up

1031
01:20:44.48 --> 01:20:48.000
He probably stole it a lot a lot of it because his wife took half but regardless

1032
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:53.92
Sponsors dropped him he himself as a human being couldn't look himself in the mirror. I'm sure right blah blah blah

1033
01:20:54.56 --> 01:21:00.88
So I said okay, well, this is my Tiger Woods or David Letterman moment like going on the radio I thought was it

1034
01:21:02.08 --> 01:21:06.24
Now we're two weeks later. Yeah, whatever it was yeah two weeks later. I'm like

1035
01:21:07.52 --> 01:21:14.88
Well, either I never drink again or I continue down the path of bullshitting myself into saying well, I'll just get better when I'm ready

1036
01:21:14.88 --> 01:21:16.88
And

1037
01:21:16.88 --> 01:21:21.60
This journey I've been on for since I left. What did I leave? I forget

1038
01:21:22.80 --> 01:21:30.40
Jan 18 or 19 I left Ottawa and I've just been driving I want to drive root 66 since I was a teenager and

1039
01:21:31.44 --> 01:21:38.40
You know like I talked to the kids I talked to Atlanta. I talked to my mom I talked to everybody that matter and I said I'll be back

1040
01:21:39.52 --> 01:21:43.84
First city council is January 31st after our Christmas break anyway

1041
01:21:43.84 --> 01:21:45.84
And I said I'll be back

1042
01:21:46.88 --> 01:21:51.84
I'm gonna go visit some people that are gonna look me in the eye and tell me if I'm fully shit or not

1043
01:21:52.24 --> 01:21:54.24
You guys being some of them and

1044
01:21:55.20 --> 01:21:57.20
When I get back

1045
01:21:57.20 --> 01:21:59.52
I'm gonna my therapist already have an appointment

1046
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.20

1047
01:22:01.20 --> 01:22:07.44
My doctors for my legs because I'm going back to basic training to learn how to use prosthetics again so I don't go through those issues again

1048
01:22:08.08 --> 01:22:10.08

1049
01:22:10.08 --> 01:22:12.64
Talk about my addiction issues. I'm gonna talk about

1050
01:22:12.64 --> 01:22:17.28
Why I'm not I'm going back to the gym. I have a diet plan already. I have a trainer waiting

01:22:28.48 --> 01:22:32.08
About the basic training and marine core base and paris island because I was like

1054
01:22:33.20 --> 01:22:40.24
Fuck man. I just I keep doing this every three or four years. I got to go back and relearn what it's like to be jodimitic because I am

1055
01:22:40.24 --> 01:22:42.24
Evolving

1056
01:22:43.60 --> 01:22:48.000
Be I had to evolve beyond the soldier and then I had to turn to the citizen and then I out now

1057
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.80
I'm returning into something else. I think because

1058
01:22:51.60 --> 01:22:59.44
I had a plan until I was 44 I thought at 25 years near me or 20 was 27 years

01:23:00.16 --> 01:23:05.28
Retire become a contractor teach shooting for the rest of my life and just be that grumpy old guy that

1060
01:23:05.44 --> 01:23:08.08
You know well if you want to know about shoot and you talk about that

1061
01:23:08.08 --> 01:23:14.000
Be good decent money right? I didn't want to get rich. I just wanted to have pay my bills and hang out with my my

1062
01:23:14.56 --> 01:23:23.44
Dream retirement was going to be to hurt all pack as around on my horse with my rifle shoot coyotes and and listen to like gangster rap and read books like that was it

1063
01:23:23.44 --> 01:23:25.44
That was what I wanted to do

1064
01:23:25.68 --> 01:23:31.12
But life has a funny way of pointing you in directions that maybe you need to go in or you didn't know yet to go and

1065
01:23:33.84 --> 01:23:35.84

1072
01:24:02.96 --> 01:24:08.80
And I think like that's how I've thought it like you know the soft guys in a world elf is but we're in

1073
01:24:09.44 --> 01:24:13.52
Teams, you know when I rolled in a team of three hardcore guys or it's me and my boys and

1074
01:24:14.24 --> 01:24:17.92
But we at the same time I knew I had artillery support. I had to air cover

1075
01:24:17.92 --> 01:24:23.60
I had this I had another sniper team cover in the flank over there and wrecky platoon over there and you never alone

1076
01:24:24.64 --> 01:24:26.64
And even last night like I

1077
01:24:27.52 --> 01:24:29.04
I felt bad I

1078
01:24:29.04 --> 01:24:33.60
I'm still in a t-shirt. I drove in all day from the t-shirt I worried the day before and he showed doc

1079
01:24:33.60 --> 01:24:38.000
I've never seen jocco dressed up and I'm like oh shit jocco was like gonna button down shirt

1080
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
And he's wearing

1081
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.24
Well, that's not good crazy. I had on a pair of jeans vans a t-shirt and a flannel shirt

1082
01:24:45.52 --> 01:24:47.52
You're just up

1083
01:24:47.52 --> 01:24:55.04
But I'm like I'm like okay, so I haven't seen him seen you in two years ish give her take a few months

1084
01:24:55.04 --> 01:25:00.24
We've talked but it's not like we've been on the phone for hours been like hey bro, what's going now like you know?

1085
01:25:00.24 --> 01:25:03.60
You were busy dudes. We kept in touch the way guys like us do but

1086
01:25:04.16 --> 01:25:09.28
We sat down and I'm like okay, do I eat dinner and then tell him tomorrow or?

1087
01:25:09.28 --> 01:25:12.48
Or and I just basically threw up all over you

1088
01:25:13.04 --> 01:25:16.72
And you and you were awesome and I love you for it and I appreciate it

1089
01:25:16.72 --> 01:25:19.76
But I needed that hour of just

1090
01:25:19.76 --> 01:25:24.64
Talking about myself and I felt bad about it took us I'm like I haven't even asked him how his kids are

1091
01:25:25.68 --> 01:25:30.56
You have I have friends that'll do you we're willing to do that and I've done that for hundreds of guys

1092
01:25:31.44 --> 01:25:37.60
But then when it's you doing the talking man, it's tough and I get it now. I get it now more than anything

1093
01:25:38.56 --> 01:25:43.28
So guys you need not you got to pull over you got to like you just got to take a knee

1094
01:25:44.08 --> 01:25:48.24
And let somebody else take point for a bit and that's just the way it is

1095
01:25:48.24 --> 01:25:53.44
You know how you were said you said you kind of understand when people

1096
01:25:54.56 --> 01:25:56.56
Feel suicidal

1097
01:25:56.56 --> 01:26:01.60
You know I know I know and I said that a bunch of times since it happened

1098
01:26:02.48 --> 01:26:06.96
But what's your question sorry like do you do you because I think about that too sometimes where

1099
01:26:07.76 --> 01:26:13.68
That's the only time I don't think about me. I'm thinking like other people like what is it take to be like you know

1100
01:26:13.68 --> 01:26:16.16
I'm gonna am my life my question is do you think that it's like

1101
01:26:16.16 --> 01:26:18.16
Like

1102
01:26:18.16 --> 01:26:24.40
That feeling is like it's almost like this immense boredom with that you know like you do you just don't have it's not like this pain

1103
01:26:24.72 --> 01:26:28.000
That I got to end it's more that like there's really no reason for me to

1104
01:26:28.56 --> 01:26:31.68
It's like you're going up this hill, but the hill isn't that steep, but it's just so

1105
01:26:31.68 --> 01:26:38.08
It's never ending yeah, you know, I think that's part of it. Yeah, like it's it's like from what I've read the few suicide notes

1106
01:26:38.08 --> 01:26:41.36
I've seen when you know when you find like we had one

1107
01:26:41.36 --> 01:26:46.32
I don't know if I talked about it on the show last time we always teach you on a sniper course and one of the guys

1108
01:26:47.36 --> 01:26:52.96
I was talking to him one moment about what we're gonna do Saturday because they're all guys you work with right

1109
01:26:52.96 --> 01:26:57.52
It's it's kind of like I'm sure it's the same as the seals a lot of them that come on to sniper course

1110
01:26:57.52 --> 01:27:03.36
Anyway, our guys you've picked out of the platoons and and then you know even if they pass

1111
01:27:03.36 --> 01:27:07.84
You still have a meeting where you go okay, do we really want to work with that go guys like I know we gave them the badge

1112
01:27:07.84 --> 01:27:09.84
But are we gonna let them into the teams

1113
01:27:09.84 --> 01:27:13.84
And then so this is one of the guys so you know, I'm getting to know him a little bit more

1114
01:27:13.84 --> 01:27:16.80
He's from the other battalion and yeah cool man

1115
01:27:16.80 --> 01:27:19.28
I know this girl in town and this and that okay right on and

1116
01:27:20.08 --> 01:27:21.84
20 minutes later like we're like what the fuck did he go?

1117
01:27:22.56 --> 01:27:28.72
We're doing roll call we're the fuck is he and we found him hanging from one of the you know the pavilion's there out in the training area

1118
01:27:29.28 --> 01:27:30.96
Forget shade during lectures

1119
01:27:30.96 --> 01:27:37.36
So he was out there and we find this letter on his pillow and I'm reading and it's about they they feel like they're in the Spain that's never ending

1120
01:27:37.36 --> 01:27:40.40
Yeah, and I don't think it's bored him. I think it's just this

1121
01:27:41.20 --> 01:27:45.68
It's the no light at the end of the tunnel feeling yeah, yeah as you were asking that question

1122
01:27:46.56 --> 01:27:50.24
That the word I wrote down was was because we've been talking about it

1123
01:27:50.24 --> 01:27:56.08
We've heard from it from the last couple podcasts that we did and it's the same thing you just said it's hope

1124
01:27:56.72 --> 01:28:01.28
So when you don't have any hope that this is gonna end when you don't see any light at the end of the tunnel and

1125
01:28:01.52 --> 01:28:05.36
Like I said when you're when you're stuck in this storm and everywhere you look

1126
01:28:05.36 --> 01:28:08.72
You don't see the light at the end of the tunnel. You don't see that this cloud ends somewhere

1127
01:28:08.72 --> 01:28:12.96
And it's a fun-during lightning will subside you just are in a storm no matter where you look

1128
01:28:12.96 --> 01:28:19.12
There's a storm and they say you know if there's no hope of getting out of this storm and I think that's where that's where they start and look

1129
01:28:19.12 --> 01:28:24.24
Having those thoughts luckily though when it when the thought entered my mind like I get it and what I'm

1130
01:28:25.76 --> 01:28:34.000
Again, I never thought of suicide, but I had the thought go through my brain where I go I get why some people might see this as an option

1131
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.12
Yeah, because I did see like because I'm texting him. I'm texting Rob. I'm texting

1132
01:28:39.52 --> 01:28:42.16
You know my my buddies and in the canceph

1133
01:28:42.16 --> 01:28:43.20
I'm

1134
01:28:43.20 --> 01:28:46.40
My regimental friends my my mom my dad my brother

1135
01:28:47.12 --> 01:28:50.72
Most of the people that should be aware there's a problem. We're aware

1136
01:28:51.76 --> 01:28:58.40
So I still had lots of light coming in but it was my now it's your choice. Are you gonna go towards it? Are you gonna stay

1137
01:28:59.20 --> 01:29:03.28
Floating where you are I guess is is a way like are you gonna reach for the line or are you gonna just sit there

1138
01:29:03.28 --> 01:29:09.76
Like it's just at an arm reach. Yeah, you know I talk about detachment all the time and this is like another situation where

1139
01:29:10.64 --> 01:29:12.64
Obviously when you're when you're

1140
01:29:14.72 --> 01:29:18.72
Rapped up in those kind of emotions right you you you can't see anything else

1141
01:29:19.20 --> 01:29:25.04
Somebody that's outside there they're perfectly clear can help guide you out of that even though it's gonna be hard

1142
01:29:25.04 --> 01:29:31.76
And there's things that are not gonna stand and all that but they can at least they know they're outside that and they can see it just like on the battlefield

1143
01:29:31.76 --> 01:29:38.24
Some of that's at elevation, you know you get building. I look at our safer position. Yeah, some guys go left go left go left

1144
01:29:38.24 --> 01:29:40.48
And they go right like fuck yeah

1145
01:29:40.88 --> 01:29:44.56
So if you can reach out to somebody that can that has a little bit better

1146
01:29:45.20 --> 01:29:47.36
Altitude on the battlefield that you're in

1147
01:29:48.08 --> 01:29:51.12
Then and if you can reach out to them say hey, man

1148
01:29:51.44 --> 01:29:56.08
I can't see what's going on all I see is darkness point me in the right direction and they're gonna tell you some

1149
01:29:56.64 --> 01:29:58.64
Dom's shit

1150
01:29:58.64 --> 01:30:04.72
Like hey, okay, let's get you to a doctor. Let's get you stop drinking. Let's get you in the gym again

1151
01:30:04.72 --> 01:30:06.40
They're gonna tell you some stuff that sounds stupid

1152
01:30:06.80 --> 01:30:11.50
It sounds well it sounds way too easy. Yeah sounds way too easy. Oh, you think it's that easy for a

1153
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.64
Focus like that, but you know what I what I like what you said is you're like man

1154
01:30:16.64 --> 01:30:18.32
I keep having to go back to boot camp

1155
01:30:18.32 --> 01:30:23.000
Yeah, and it's like that's really if you think about what boot camp is what is boot camp? They're like okay

1156
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.44
Put your shoes on like this make your bed like that eat this food do this workout

1157
01:30:27.44 --> 01:30:32.96
That's what they do they get you on the program that lead it's it leaves the success and it it leads to

1158
01:30:34.32 --> 01:30:40.40
Having your life somewhat sorted out and once you get that then you look around you go. Okay now these bigger problems

1159
01:30:41.20 --> 01:30:44.48
If I can control these little things I can control this this thing that's a little bit bigger

1160
01:30:44.48 --> 01:30:46.56
And if I can control that I can control this thing that's a little bit bigger

1161
01:30:46.56 --> 01:30:49.12
If I can control that that I control this other thing that's a little bit bigger

1162
01:30:49.12 --> 01:30:54.56
But when you're not you know to same thing I talk about all the time with the with the chesions and the Russians not you know

1163
01:30:54.56 --> 01:31:01.04
Failing on that first war and it all started when they stop shaving all to same thing with your personal life when you when you

1164
01:31:01.44 --> 01:31:06.16
Disregard these these fundamental things that you would do in boot camp

1165
01:31:06.56 --> 01:31:11.44
Yeah, when you start letting them go well then if the little things fall apart then the bigger things fall apart

1166
01:31:11.44 --> 01:31:16.80
But contrary to that when you put the little things together you can start putting the bigger things together

1167
01:31:16.80 --> 01:31:21.52
And I said you're doing this whole podcast. I've talked about what did I stop doing? I stopped oh

1168
01:31:21.52 --> 01:31:28.56
Well fuck I'm gonna eat pizza tonight instead of my prescribed diet that I've the eight for years and it makes me feel good and keeps me in good shape

1169
01:31:29.04 --> 01:31:34.08
Because fuck it today and then next day. It's like why did it yesterday? I'm gonna have cocoa puffs with breakfast

1170
01:31:34.64 --> 01:31:39.84
And it was just a downward spiral of I don't need to go see my therapist just all the way on the other ten is town

1171
01:31:39.84 --> 01:31:41.84
And I know my life sucks right now

1172
01:31:41.84 --> 01:31:47.68
Don't somebody to tell me that my life sucks. I know hey what do you talk about with a therapist?

1173
01:31:47.68 --> 01:31:51.92
What do they talk about what do you do there so I've been assuming you've never no

1174
01:31:54.72 --> 01:32:00.40
Honestly like you just bounce life off them or what I'm saying is if you got a guy this listening right now

1175
01:32:00.72 --> 01:32:05.76
That's like you know is it embarrassing not even embarrassing if you got a guy this listening right now

1176
01:32:05.76 --> 01:32:09.04
That's going well what the hell would a therapist tell me why would I not just

1177
01:32:09.04 --> 01:32:16.40
You know right in a journal or you do something like that do that too. Okay. I write in a journal which I again which I stopped doing again

1178
01:32:17.68 --> 01:32:21.68
The writing in the journal is like yourself check because I go back I was reading through my

1179
01:32:21.68 --> 01:32:26.96
I kept a journal throughout the year kind of but you know not as often as you should

1180
01:32:27.28 --> 01:32:34.96
And I was reading through it and I'm like wow I'm even bullshitting myself in this my last therapy session which is right before the downward

1181
01:32:34.96 --> 01:32:36.96
Angle started

1182
01:32:38.80 --> 01:32:43.36
He said a few things to me that needed to be said and I kind of took it to heart

1183
01:32:43.36 --> 01:32:47.84
I guess I like oh shit, but basically he said you're putting a lot of work into being jodimetic

1184
01:32:49.12 --> 01:32:53.68
And I was like fuck you man you don't even know you don't even know but

1185
01:32:54.56 --> 01:32:58.72
Like listen like this is over a year ago and right now I'm like I'm still like out just that

1186
01:32:59.28 --> 01:33:01.28
hurt but I he was right and

1187
01:33:01.28 --> 01:33:07.76
It took me this whole time to get to the point where I'm leveling off now, but therapy is you know

1188
01:33:11.68 --> 01:33:16.72
I think I said this to you last night. It's like Tiger Woods. Okay Tiger Woods bad example on how to mitigate crisis

1189
01:33:16.72 --> 01:33:22.16
But how to golf coach is whole career and guess when he started sucking when he stopped seeing his golf coach

1190
01:33:23.68 --> 01:33:25.68
No one is an expert on life

1191
01:33:25.68 --> 01:33:31.68
I didn't have PTSD when I got wounded. I was cleared two different therapists and a psychiatrist both said

1192
01:33:32.16 --> 01:33:39.28
Clear to PTSD massive depression which is normal for losing even a loved one right and when they you when you lose

1193
01:33:39.28 --> 01:33:41.28
A limb they say it's like losing a loved one

1194
01:33:41.68 --> 01:33:44.16
So two loved ones died when it but whatever whatever

1195
01:33:45.20 --> 01:33:47.20
But PTSD can come back

1196
01:33:47.20 --> 01:33:51.20
We in the can't do we call it operational stress injury which I was diagnosed with

1197
01:33:51.20 --> 01:33:55.36
Which is like an injury so if you spray in your ankle or break your ankle it's an injury

1198
01:33:55.92 --> 01:34:00.72
One heals differently from the other right left alone. They both lead the failure

1199
01:34:01.36 --> 01:34:08.16
Your ankle will completely deteriorate and fall off and have to be cut out of the body or replaced if you don't treat it

1200
01:34:08.80 --> 01:34:14.96
If you're um I don't know what you guys call a Humvee or what do you call it truck? Yeah Humvee Humvee Hummer

1201
01:34:14.96 --> 01:34:19.52
If you're a hummer blows an axle do you yell at it and tell this toughen up and go have a fucking drink

1202
01:34:19.52 --> 01:34:21.52
No, you sent it in for fucking maintenance

1203
01:34:22.32 --> 01:34:25.36
And I used to say this to troops all the time. I'll say it again

1204
01:34:25.36 --> 01:34:28.48
And I've said it before I've said this to kernels and generals like

1205
01:34:29.12 --> 01:34:32.16
Dude man if you need maintenance go it go to the fucking maintenance shop

1206
01:34:32.32 --> 01:34:34.56
Which is in our case the fucking mine guy

1207
01:34:35.20 --> 01:34:38.16
I had it talk with the chief of defense staff which is our

1208
01:34:38.96 --> 01:34:40.96
Not sective

1209
01:34:40.96 --> 01:34:46.64
Chief of staff the chairman of the joint chiefs. Yeah, and we were talking about combat units and I said well, you know

1210
01:34:46.64 --> 01:34:50.24
And we were both getting on the floss flasophical side of things

1211
01:34:52.08 --> 01:34:57.44
Samurai used to meditate and practice and they do practice calligraphy to perfect it and the tea ceremony

1212
01:34:58.48 --> 01:35:02.72
Warrior monks of Europe would meditate would pray and fast

1213
01:35:03.92 --> 01:35:08.16
The Mongolian hordes even had their ceremonies where they

1214
01:35:08.72 --> 01:35:12.96
Purge the demons and let it it what do our modern soldiers do?

1215
01:35:12.96 --> 01:35:18.96
There's no self reflection. There's no meditation. There's no we got to start from basic training

1216
01:35:18.96 --> 01:35:22.16
I've said and I don't know if I said this on the last podcast if I did I apologize

1217
01:35:22.16 --> 01:35:24.16
I forgot my own advice again

1218
01:35:25.04 --> 01:35:27.04
What's rice?

1219
01:35:27.04 --> 01:35:30.40
Rice for your body. Oh rest out ice

1220
01:35:31.52 --> 01:35:35.60
Compression elevation that's taught to you the first day of basic training because you're not

1221
01:35:35.60 --> 01:35:41.44
I remembered it. Ah right, but that's your vehicle, right? And your vehicle of your body that gets you into combat

1222
01:35:41.44 --> 01:35:45.76
Which is where the unit needs you which is where your country wants you what's rice for the mind

1223
01:35:46.56 --> 01:35:51.04
And this is where we all is a society have to go back and think about these things like

1224
01:35:53.04 --> 01:35:56.40
It is it is it is it is it is but this is my point

1225
01:35:56.96 --> 01:35:59.60
So when you go to a therapist if you have no

1226
01:35:59.92 --> 01:36:01.92
Juditsu in your life you don't have

1227
01:36:02.40 --> 01:36:05.68
Surfing you don't have calligraphy you don't know how to meditate

1228
01:36:05.68 --> 01:36:11.52
This could be the beginning of you learning how to be of the beginning of learning rice for your mind

1229
01:36:11.76 --> 01:36:13.76
And that's how I look at it, but even still

1230
01:36:14.80 --> 01:36:19.92
I know enough about medicine that I can take care of myself for the most part without going to the doctor

1231
01:36:20.32 --> 01:36:23.52
But guess what now and then I hit something and I go fuck I need a doctor

1232
01:36:24.24 --> 01:36:27.76
So therapy doesn't mean you have to go every week on

1233
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.44
border like clockwork

1234
01:36:29.44 --> 01:36:31.44
But have someone that you're

1235
01:36:31.44 --> 01:36:40.24
That's your therapist or your psychiatrist or whoever whatever level you need or you qualify for in your benefits

1236
01:36:41.28 --> 01:36:46.64
And that doesn't mean you go see them all the time. I had a guy that I saw when I had to

1237
01:36:47.76 --> 01:36:52.88
But a lot of it is up to you to the individual is still a big part of this eye as an individual

1238
01:36:52.88 --> 01:36:57.20
This is where it hit me really hard and when you heard the emotion of my voice on the radio that day

1239
01:36:57.20 --> 01:37:00.72
I stopped even paying attention to myself

1240
01:37:01.60 --> 01:37:07.60
And I as an individual failed myself my friends my sorry myself my family

1241
01:37:08.24 --> 01:37:16.64
So my daughters my ex my mom my dad everyone who loves me for who I am no matter what I do and then I failed everyone around me that

1242
01:37:17.84 --> 01:37:25.20
My friends you guys and this is how you feel because I didn't as an individual take ownership of the problem

1243
01:37:25.20 --> 01:37:31.60
So now I am and I'm going back to therapy and going back to the gym and back on my diet

1244
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:38.56
I know I don't look at but hey, I'm on the road and you know those little powdered donuts and little thing with a coffee while you're driving the

1245
01:37:38.56 --> 01:37:40.56
Licious outstanding

1246
01:37:40.56 --> 01:37:47.44
Talking about the chocolate covered ones are the problems those ones too. I found those ones at a gas station in like Texas somewhere and they are on that

1247
01:37:48.16 --> 01:37:52.32
Bro, we don't have those things in Canada. They have them in America but Duncan don't it donuts?

1248
01:37:52.32 --> 01:37:56.64
Might be better than Tim Horton's I'm gonna go ahead and say they're better. Oh, and any Canadian

1249
01:37:56.64 --> 01:38:01.04
They want to fight me Tim Horton's own by Brazilian company now. So whatever the point is

1250
01:38:02.48 --> 01:38:06.40
I'm getting back to that life that led me that kept me in check because

1251
01:38:07.60 --> 01:38:09.60
Getting your legs blown off as a rough go

1252
01:38:10.64 --> 01:38:13.20
And I'll tell you that right now, but it's not impossible

1253
01:38:13.68 --> 01:38:20.24
But like any injury I have a spot in my back like mid back just below the shoulder blades that I hurt when I was 14

1254
01:38:20.24 --> 01:38:28.000
And I felt it in basic I felt it's hurt my whole career, but you work on the muscles around it and you learn to mitigate its impact on your daily life

1255
01:38:28.64 --> 01:38:35.92
Mental injuries are the same and I can tell you I was cleared of PTSD which is like the extreme mental injury

1256
01:38:35.92 --> 01:38:41.92
But I did have a mental injury and I forgot that and then I had physical injuries on top of it that I basically

1257
01:38:43.04 --> 01:38:47.60
Ignored you know like even the mayor of Ottawa. He'd be like hey, Jodie your limpant today

1258
01:38:47.60 --> 01:38:52.000
What's going on? I didn't think you're gonna make it to this event. This is before I the wheels fell off

1259
01:38:52.48 --> 01:38:53.92
I go yeah, I'm area

1260
01:38:53.92 --> 01:38:57.76
You know I was feeling a little Spain and I know I don't have to be here today, but then I remembered yeah

1261
01:38:57.76 --> 01:39:03.20
I'm not a pussy so I'm here and he'd laugh like oh Jodie you're you're unique politician

1262
01:39:03.20 --> 01:39:04.000
That's for sure

1263
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.40
But what I'm saying is like I'm too stupid to stay home tonight so that tomorrow morning

1264
01:39:08.40 --> 01:39:12.000
I can feel better and go to the gym play with my kids like that you know what I mean like it's

1265
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:18.32
Two to two tough to be that dumb. Yeah, so a lot of this clearly is

1266
01:39:20.40 --> 01:39:21.44
ego

1267
01:39:21.44 --> 01:39:31.12
Oh bro, he goes on mother fucker and it's funny because it's not about this all time, but like obviously you wouldn't be who you were and

1268
01:39:32.32 --> 01:39:36.64
Have done what you've done if you didn't have an ego that drove you that want made made you want to be I mean

1269
01:39:36.64 --> 01:39:42.16
Why would anyone subject themselves to going to sniper school of course? Yeah, it sounds like a cool job

1270
01:39:42.16 --> 01:39:46.40
It's it's a shitty job. It sucks it's hard to do but guess what your ego you like I want to do that

1271
01:39:46.40 --> 01:39:53.92
I want you to best donny wellberg shows you the sexiest part of the job with your shoot bad guys. Yeah, which is like so rare by the way like

1272
01:39:54.96 --> 01:39:56.96
Yeah, the rest of the job

1273
01:39:56.96 --> 01:40:02.88
So so so you wouldn't have done I mean that the books the politicians the podcast everything that you've done

1274
01:40:02.88 --> 01:40:08.16
There's there's some element of ego that drives it obviously you want to serve and it will you wouldn't be if it was just pure ego

1275
01:40:08.40 --> 01:40:15.52
You wouldn't be able to do it either because you you have to have a will to serve and a desire to serve your country and your brothers in arms

1276
01:40:15.52 --> 01:40:17.52
So that's true, too, but

1277
01:40:17.52 --> 01:40:23.36
To take the next level you got to have some ego driving and then what that's that thing that can drive you to success

1278
01:40:23.76 --> 01:40:25.04
Can also

1279
01:40:25.04 --> 01:40:29.44
Drag you down when you start saying I can do anything I can get through this I can gut through this

1280
01:40:29.44 --> 01:40:33.68
Yeah, you need help I can keep on this path I can quick drink whenever I want those are all things

1281
01:40:33.68 --> 01:40:37.04
Well, you're your your your ego is your biggest enemy

1282
01:40:37.44 --> 01:40:40.32
But you are your own biggest critic as well

1283
01:40:41.12 --> 01:40:49.04
Jaco, I'm sure you have these thoughts like you're any other human being like if I fail anyone today the person I don't want to fail is myself

1284
01:40:50.16 --> 01:40:54.48
Because you have an expectation of yourself and I know I know enough about you and I you know

1285
01:40:54.48 --> 01:40:58.72
We are the enough of the same guys, much as we are different that the biggest person

1286
01:40:58.72 --> 01:41:01.28
I'm trying to live up to expectations are my own

1287
01:41:02.32 --> 01:41:05.28
So when you get up at 4 am every day and God damn it

1288
01:41:05.28 --> 01:41:08.32
I wish I could but I'm not built that bro. I like to sleep

1289
01:41:09.20 --> 01:41:11.28
I don't have to if I don't want to do anyway, but

1290
01:41:11.76 --> 01:41:15.60
Like see listen right now like I could up at 330 if I fuck a 1 to okay

1291
01:41:15.60 --> 01:41:20.16
I just don't want to I don't have to I can get all my shit done in eight hours, okay?

1292
01:41:20.16 --> 01:41:26.72
Jaco but your ego is the one that goes I can do that and then your critic is the one that goes when you can't bitch

1293
01:41:26.72 --> 01:41:28.72
And

1294
01:41:28.72 --> 01:41:34.32
If you fail the first critic that's there looking in is the one when you look in the mirror and you go

1295
01:41:34.88 --> 01:41:38.48
I would do it man. I would fucking do I would look in the mirror. I stopped like

1296
01:41:39.60 --> 01:41:45.04
Like you know I like I keep a bit of a beard most times my beard got big and then it started growing in here

1297
01:41:45.04 --> 01:41:47.28
And that's when you know something's up with somebody

1298
01:41:47.68 --> 01:41:52.000
No, I'm serious right now. I know that's why I would not look in the mirror

1299
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:58.96
Yeah, because when I looked in the mirror I I saw someone who went you drank last night again didn't you fucking loser

1300
01:42:00.16 --> 01:42:03.60
Good job. Yeah, I want you shower and go and work

1301
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.84
So this this started coming in because even if I looked in the mirror is just enough to be okay

1302
01:42:09.84 --> 01:42:11.20
I'm not a complete mess

1303
01:42:11.20 --> 01:42:13.20
Run out the door my hair grew

1304
01:42:13.20 --> 01:42:20.96
It's it's it's weird man. I can I'm I'm trying to write this down because I I even if it doesn't come out for anybody but myself

1305
01:42:21.84 --> 01:42:23.84
It's

1306
01:42:23.84 --> 01:42:28.64
I didn't go through with the legs losing the legs and I did go through losing my legs again, but

1307
01:42:29.20 --> 01:42:32.88
Whole other thing bunch of stuff was happening like realizing

1308
01:42:33.60 --> 01:42:36.32
I know I said the soldier is dead, but

1309
01:42:36.88 --> 01:42:38.88
Maybe I didn't really realize

1310
01:42:38.88 --> 01:42:43.76
And I had all these people looking up to me and also

1311
01:42:45.20 --> 01:42:54.32
Turning to me to have okay, hey my buddies and in trouble go talk to Jody this guys that she's in trouble like and you're taking on all this other stuff and

1312
01:42:56.40 --> 01:42:58.40
Honestly man self

1313
01:42:58.40 --> 01:43:02.88
I don't know what they call it self care. I think is what they call it self care is your first priority

1314
01:43:02.88 --> 01:43:09.44
Self-made we call it self-made but yeah, that's like your first person you got to take care of yourself and luckily my daughters are so awesome that

1315
01:43:09.44 --> 01:43:15.44
You know, I talked to them on the trip every day and like okay when you get back. Yeah, we'll we'll kick it off right where we left it off, but

1316
01:43:17.36 --> 01:43:21.20
There the first ones that are gonna forgive you if you ask for it and

1317
01:43:22.08 --> 01:43:26.72
So I've asked my daughters. I told them daddy's going through some stuff right you notice they're both like yeah

1318
01:43:27.44 --> 01:43:31.60
Because kids don't get they don't give it shit. I call you got kids, right? Yes. Yeah, how many you got again?

1319
01:43:31.60 --> 01:43:36.32
Yeah, they're the first ones gonna tell you when you they were the first ones to tell me like hey

1320
01:43:36.56 --> 01:43:38.72
I'll come in not coming around as much as you said you would

1321
01:43:39.28 --> 01:43:44.000
God damn it daddy's really busy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You've always been busy. We want to go to the park

1322
01:43:45.52 --> 01:43:51.76
But yeah, man. I'm on I'm just trying to rebuild everything and and stay stay on the path finally

1323
01:43:52.32 --> 01:43:56.000
I think I hope when I'm 50 I'm not going through something again

1324
01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.80
Because by then I'm just gonna be too old and want to deal with shit. You know, I'm like I'm not saying that's old

1325
01:44:00.80 --> 01:44:04.000
I'm just saying like you should have your shit together by the time you're 50 I think

1326
01:44:04.96 --> 01:44:08.40
Or maybe I will but at least I'll have these lessons learned over the last

1327
01:44:09.68 --> 01:44:13.92
Since 2007 when you're trying to write these down you mean you're writing down what you're going through right now

1328
01:44:14.24 --> 01:44:20.000
I'm writing it down and also because I am in the position that I am in right you know where we're authors now

1329
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:25.60
I've out of anything else like we talked we talked about this last night doesn't make us artists but kind of does

1330
01:44:26.32 --> 01:44:28.32
writing is an art

1331
01:44:28.72 --> 01:44:30.32
But people

1332
01:44:30.32 --> 01:44:35.84
If people can learn from what I'm going through and I know others have written books and done the gone through the exact same thing

1333
01:44:35.84 --> 01:44:37.84
But we all have a unique way of presenting things

1334
01:44:38.80 --> 01:44:40.48
Maybe I turn it into a lesson

1335
01:44:40.48 --> 01:44:43.60
Maybe I turn it into something I read like I've read your book

1336
01:44:43.60 --> 01:44:49.60
Four times since it came out. I've rereading Tim Ferriss's book again for our work week because

1337
01:44:50.40 --> 01:44:54.08
That's the direction of life that I would like to go in politics or not like

1338
01:44:55.12 --> 01:45:00.24
Doing it your way but in a way that's smarter and not harder and in the army right we learn

1339
01:45:00.64 --> 01:45:05.76
There's the refmart way. There's the hard way and then there's the army way or in the navy. I'm sure it's the same

1340
01:45:06.48 --> 01:45:08.48
And sometimes none of them make sense

1341
01:45:08.96 --> 01:45:10.24
But you get it done

1342
01:45:10.24 --> 01:45:16.08
But I you know I want to spend more time on myself my kids my loved ones my friends and

1343
01:45:16.80 --> 01:45:22.80
I think and I said this sounds a little conceited and a little bit egotistical and a little bit selfish

1344
01:45:22.80 --> 01:45:31.04
But I've realized I getting my legs blown off maybe I've earned the right to just do kind of what I want a little bit more than I did in the last 10 years

1345
01:45:31.60 --> 01:45:36.88
And I want to hang out with my friends do something constructive for society still but

1346
01:45:36.88 --> 01:45:41.36
If I want to go shoot I want to go shoot if I want to drive my car across America

1347
01:45:41.68 --> 01:45:48.64
Well, and I just want to do that and I think I've earned the right to have a little bit of flexibility in life to just throw my kids in the car and go

1348
01:45:49.76 --> 01:45:56.08
Well, I actually know you've earned that right and I told you that the first day of match you when you were talking about what you were doing and I was like man

1349
01:45:56.08 --> 01:45:59.12
You're you're doing way more than I'd be doing you know

1350
01:45:59.12 --> 01:46:05.04
I'd be I'd be spending a lot of time my kids, but you know you have goals and aspirations and and you've achieved those

1351
01:46:05.04 --> 01:46:09.68
You know and you've done a great job up there and and so that's good, you know, it's awesome to see and if that

1352
01:46:10.24 --> 01:46:15.84
Change directions and now you can focus on you know taking care of your family take care of your self

1353
01:46:16.32 --> 01:46:19.52
Which yeah have you earned it? Hell yeah, you've earned it. Well

1354
01:46:21.04 --> 01:46:29.36
I think what we always forget and what I forgot and I've continuously have to remind myself of is I'm the beginning and the end of everything in my world

1355
01:46:30.08 --> 01:46:32.08
And that sounds like a self

1356
01:46:32.08 --> 01:46:33.68
What do you call itself?

1357
01:46:33.68 --> 01:46:35.68
Self-fulfilling prophecy no no no

1358
01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:44.32
Self-envolved a little too self-envolved, but if I'm not up and ready to go at 8 a.m. my kids don't get to school in time

1359
01:46:44.88 --> 01:46:48.40
And if my kids are late their teachers met at them and then it's a snowball in their life

1360
01:46:48.48 --> 01:46:54.24
If I'm late they wonder where I am if if I'm not at the office my staff has to tell someone hey where's

1361
01:46:54.24 --> 01:46:55.44
Counts are medic

1362
01:46:55.44 --> 01:47:02.56
He's not here right now. Where is he? I don't know or they may have to make a bullshit excuse and even if you tell them your job is the life for your boss

1363
01:47:02.56 --> 01:47:07.68
No, no, it's not your job is beyond to work on time joddy

1364
01:47:08.80 --> 01:47:10.32
So self

1365
01:47:10.32 --> 01:47:18.000
Care and self help and all that stuff is and taking care of yourself is the beginning of taking care of everyone that you feel you have a duty to

1366
01:47:18.40 --> 01:47:19.68
Yeah, and that's

1367
01:47:19.68 --> 01:47:22.40
Ultimately what I want to talk about here and what I want

1368
01:47:23.04 --> 01:47:26.80
You know, so you know when I when I bust your balls about getting up at 330 the morning

1369
01:47:27.04 --> 01:47:30.000
That's what jocco does to make sure that everything in jocco's life

1370
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.72
Falls in a place for those you have four kids bro. Yeah. I don't know how you keep up with them all

1371
01:47:35.04 --> 01:47:40.24
I only have two and I can barely do it and and so what I'm saying when I go back to my having my legs blown off

1372
01:47:40.32 --> 01:47:43.52
It earns me the right to be a little bit selfish about what I do with my time

1373
01:47:44.48 --> 01:47:46.88
Well, I'm gonna be selfish and take care of myself more

1374
01:47:47.44 --> 01:47:49.44
Which I haven't for a decade

1375
01:47:49.84 --> 01:47:52.96
Well, I would expand that to to really to everybody

1376
01:47:53.20 --> 01:47:55.20
I'm gonna tell you what I mean

1377
01:47:55.20 --> 01:48:03.12
You owe it to yourself everybody whether you've been wounded or not right wherever you are in life because the fact of what you just said

1378
01:48:03.12 --> 01:48:06.40
You gotta remember this if you don't take care of yourself

1379
01:48:06.96 --> 01:48:11.76
You can't take care of the other people around right and and so you have to you have to take care of yourself

1380
01:48:11.76 --> 01:48:16.40
You know my simple thing and my wife knows this about me like if I don't work out I'm

1381
01:48:18.24 --> 01:48:20.88
I'm not a good I'm not I'm not the same person right?

1382
01:48:20.88 --> 01:48:25.52
Good person yeah, but but really if I'm not taking care of my health

1383
01:48:26.16 --> 01:48:31.52
Then everything else kind of starts falling apart and so yeah, you gotta take care of yourself

1384
01:48:31.52 --> 01:48:36.96
And if you don't take care of yourself then you can't take care of the people that you care about and and so that's the duty really

1385
01:48:36.96 --> 01:48:42.08
And that's what I wanted to talk about a little bit today and what I was saying before about if you're feeling it pull over

1386
01:48:42.56 --> 01:48:46.56
And that's the thing like you can't expect anything of anyone else if you can't

1387
01:48:46.56 --> 01:48:56.56
If you can't show up a work on time like why should you your staff and if you don't take care of yourself and then why should you expect to take care of anyone else and

1388
01:48:59.28 --> 01:49:04.56
We all have support you know and I'm I know I'm I own home hammer in this little too hard, but dude

1389
01:49:05.12 --> 01:49:10.64
I'm I'm learning a hard lesson here and I'm trying to avoid we all I think have to learn it

1390
01:49:10.64 --> 01:49:15.44
But there's like there's you can learn it harder than others. I think I'm learning it the really hard way

1391
01:49:15.44 --> 01:49:24.48
Because I am a public person like like private and can't we call them blogging's blogging is like Smith in the Army

1392
01:49:24.48 --> 01:49:29.04
So if blogging is having a rough time he doesn't have to go on the radio until the world

1393
01:49:29.04 --> 01:49:32.80
He doesn't have to go on the jacco podcast and tell the world, but he has to tell somebody

1394
01:49:33.84 --> 01:49:39.44
And that's the biggest thing you think you think it's scary to go to a therapist who is a trained professional like

1395
01:49:39.84 --> 01:49:44.08
Think of a therapist like going to the rifle range and learning from the master sniper

1396
01:49:44.08 --> 01:49:48.08
That's what you're doing you're going to learn how to shoot except it's for fit for your mind

1397
01:49:48.40 --> 01:49:52.72
Would you not go to the range to learn from a master sniper if you want to be a better shot?

1398
01:49:52.72 --> 01:49:57.92
Of course you fucking would I I'm a master sniper and I'd go to the range and learn from master sniper right now

1399
01:49:58.56 --> 01:50:03.92
That's what a therapist or psychiatrist or psychologist or counselor any of them are professionals in

1400
01:50:04.56 --> 01:50:06.24
The mental game of life

1401
01:50:06.24 --> 01:50:09.60
Now I'm not saying all are equal as well if you don't like one

1402
01:50:10.48 --> 01:50:11.92
Fire them and get a different one

1403
01:50:11.92 --> 01:50:18.08
But start there and start looking for the help that's available and don't put it all on yourself and again

1404
01:50:18.08 --> 01:50:23.92
If you think that's embarrassing going to a stranger, which is actually pretty easy when you actually get in the room and start talking

1405
01:50:23.92 --> 01:50:26.88
You find you might they might have to tell you to shut up because of the hours up

1406
01:50:28.80 --> 01:50:33.76
Try going on the radio or the jacco podcast or writing a book like you know

1407
01:50:33.76 --> 01:50:39.20
I put out a lot of my words in that book too and I'm still learning and

1408
01:50:39.20 --> 01:50:46.000
I've got all these resources so you know, it's not it's not it's not it's not no one's too proud no one's too tough

1409
01:50:47.04 --> 01:50:50.48
And I'm both done like talking because I was something fun right now. Oh, like

1410
01:50:51.52 --> 01:50:54.32
No, it's all good man and I think you know

1411
01:50:55.44 --> 01:50:59.12
As we were talking and I didn't I didn't know if we were gonna do a podcast or not when you came down here

1412
01:50:59.12 --> 01:51:01.28
I didn't know if you want to talk about any of this stuff or we're just gonna hang out

1413
01:51:01.28 --> 01:51:06.48
I appreciate this because the whole drive I've been thinking and talking to myself and listening to other podcasts

1414
01:51:06.48 --> 01:51:08.48
I'm like I need to do this

1415
01:51:08.48 --> 01:51:10.48
Yeah, and

1416
01:51:10.48 --> 01:51:15.84
Really like what you're saying is gonna it's obviously it's gonna help people especially the idea

1417
01:51:17.28 --> 01:51:19.60
And I'm glad you talked about this a little bit you kind of threw it in there

1418
01:51:19.60 --> 01:51:24.40
But like looking at yourself in the mirror right looking at yourself in the mirror and saying to yourself

1419
01:51:24.40 --> 01:51:28.88
You know what I need some fire support here. I'm gonna reach out and I'm gonna get it from some people

1420
01:51:29.20 --> 01:51:32.40
And there's not a damn thing in the world wrong with that and

1421
01:51:33.52 --> 01:51:35.52
That's how you

1422
01:51:35.52 --> 01:51:37.04
sort of

1423
01:51:37.04 --> 01:51:41.20
That was the thing that was the thing that made you go okay. I need help. I'm gonna go make this happen

1424
01:51:41.20 --> 01:51:44.000
And so it maybe that can help some other people that

1425
01:51:44.88 --> 01:51:49.20
Aren't feeling too good right now go look in the mirror and admit to yourself you got some problems

1426
01:51:49.44 --> 01:51:53.44
Maybe the problems are a little bit bigger than you we've been in combat situations that were bigger than us

1427
01:51:53.52 --> 01:51:58.000
You have to call and fire support. There's nothing wrong with it. There's no shame in it go make it happen

1428
01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.20
Yeah, and and take care of yourself take ownership

1429
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.32
Extreme ownership. I like the way you think

1430
01:52:04.32 --> 01:52:06.32
I

1431
01:52:06.32 --> 01:52:08.32
You know

1432
01:52:08.32 --> 01:52:12.72
I think that's a good place man. I think that's a good place to chill if we want to talk about something different

1433
01:52:12.72 --> 01:52:16.24
We can do that really easily all we do is we just ask echo to talk for a little bit

1434
01:52:16.80 --> 01:52:18.32
Yeah, good answer to floss

1435
01:52:18.32 --> 01:52:20.32
Okay, go Charles. Yes, you

1436
01:52:21.28 --> 01:52:23.04
You know we want to talk about something good

1437
01:52:23.44 --> 01:52:30.16
Can you talk about something good like maybe how to support ourselves and if if they want someone wants maybe how someone could support

1438
01:52:31.12 --> 01:52:33.12
This podcast if they want

1439
01:52:33.12 --> 01:52:35.12
It's your choice. We should yeah

1440
01:52:35.76 --> 01:52:40.56
Joccal krill oil and joint warfare here's the thing you know how like my joint I've been hurting me lately

1441
01:52:40.72 --> 01:52:47.04
Yeah, and sometimes you can be able to do some joint warfare for sure. Yeah, it helps not in a non drug

1442
01:52:48.24 --> 01:52:51.28
Farm a suitable way. It's good. Yeah, it's interesting

1443
01:52:51.84 --> 01:52:54.64
But it does work especially if you're getting physical and whatnot

1444
01:52:54.64 --> 01:53:02.88
General joint disintegration or degeneration degeneration not disintegration. Yeah. I don't I don't know how much you tell

1445
01:53:03.44 --> 01:53:08.000
With disintegration nonetheless Jocquas some supplements. They're good supplements. They're four-year joints

1446
01:53:09.44 --> 01:53:11.44
One is krill oil super krill oil

1447
01:53:11.44 --> 01:53:14.48
Yeah, that was called joint warfare. Look. Oh, so I mean could join yes

1448
01:53:15.20 --> 01:53:20.24
Curcumin and curcumin that's for like cardillage. It's all right. It's joint war

1449
01:53:20.24 --> 01:53:25.60
No, because you know like when you're manniscus or like your elbows stop saying such big words just talk

1450
01:53:25.84 --> 01:53:29.04
I'm the brown telling you this is this is the true real deal

1451
01:53:29.60 --> 01:53:32.40
So if I take this the knee I tweaked the other night

1452
01:53:33.12 --> 01:53:40.32
This will help it with the manniscus around my kneecap. Yes, the the joint warfare. Well. I'm into it. Yeah, fully

1453
01:53:40.88 --> 01:53:44.64
Also what we kind of talked about earlier

1454
01:53:44.64 --> 01:53:50.88
Jocquad discipline pre workout. We call it pre workout, but it's a pre mission because that's cognitive enhancers

1455
01:53:53.60 --> 01:53:55.12
Pre mission I love this

1456
01:53:55.36 --> 01:54:02.16
Jody's checking it out right up about it nonetheless that's good that's good for anything you're about to do so we say pre workout

1457
01:54:02.16 --> 01:54:04.16
It can be pre study

1458
01:54:04.80 --> 01:54:07.12
pre exam pre test pre

1459
01:54:07.12 --> 01:54:11.28
uh pre podcast podcast whatever night whatever you like it's good

1460
01:54:11.28 --> 01:54:18.24
Unless you can take one or two scoops don't be a pussy take two scoops guys. I come out. Let what do we say in here? Sorry sorry

1461
01:54:19.44 --> 01:54:21.44
I had a real

1462
01:54:21.84 --> 01:54:24.24
Long night the other night of of work

1463
01:54:25.28 --> 01:54:27.28
And I took three

1464
01:54:27.28 --> 01:54:32.24
What do you normally take two two so what do you what do you weigh in out 220?

1465
01:54:32.80 --> 01:54:33.76
No

1466
01:54:33.76 --> 01:54:35.12
It's probably

1467
01:54:35.12 --> 01:54:37.92
230 230 and so two scoops is enough for you

1468
01:54:37.92 --> 01:54:41.44
Yeah, yeah, okay, so I'll stick to two scoops for now

1469
01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.64
But I might ramp it up to four if I really have to be careful

1470
01:54:45.28 --> 01:54:47.28
Make sure you have something to do

1471
01:54:47.84 --> 01:54:53.28
Like a project like don't just take like great take yeah, that's a great time

1472
01:54:53.28 --> 01:54:58.80
Yeah, if you have to write and then do you find it does it make you jittery? No no, no, because it's so it's a smooth

1473
01:54:59.12 --> 01:55:02.88
But you got the energy yeah, it's got the caffeine's pretty low the caffeine is very low

1474
01:55:02.88 --> 01:55:08.40
It's the same caffeine as jocquawaiti the same amount so per scoop so you'll get double that

1475
01:55:08.40 --> 01:55:10.40
But it's not it's a 15 milligrams so

1476
01:55:10.96 --> 01:55:15.84
It's meant to not make you all jittery because you can't that's not good everything else

1477
01:55:15.84 --> 01:55:18.56
I'm reading in here and what little I do know about nutrition

1478
01:55:18.56 --> 01:55:23.20
This is all stuff for focus and long-term like energy release. Yes

1479
01:55:23.76 --> 01:55:28.16
You know anything missing that I don't know science is would be vitamin

1480
01:55:28.96 --> 01:55:30.48
Is that in there?

1481
01:55:30.48 --> 01:55:35.20
I'm missing it. I think so turning 40 means I have to wear glasses now too by the way

1482
01:55:35.20 --> 01:55:39.20
Like I wrote that I want to small to my perfect us in case sniper vision

1483
01:55:39.20 --> 01:55:42.64
I think is good for long distance, but now I'm like my dad

1484
01:55:43.36 --> 01:55:46.16
Yeah, you got to find the sweet spot that's what it is

1485
01:55:46.16 --> 01:55:48.40
There it right because your eyes can't like

1486
01:55:48.40 --> 01:55:50.40
L too or whatever

1487
01:55:50.40 --> 01:55:57.12
I'll be taking can I have a case you have that right straight at all this right here actually that's good and surprisingly taste good

1488
01:55:57.12 --> 01:56:01.40
What an expect chocolate would be like make a taste like very hyper about making things taste

1489
01:56:01.40 --> 01:56:08.16
Here's things don't they face like crap then life is hard food should be tasty. Yeah, I dig it and I

1490
01:56:08.24 --> 01:56:11.20
Understand that but you would why do they talk then you can drink?

1491
01:56:11.92 --> 01:56:14.72
So you're saying it's out of character from me to one in line

1492
01:56:14.72 --> 01:56:20.64
I think that's the dichotomy you because I heard that before even like with you said you don't drink coffee

1493
01:56:20.88 --> 01:56:24.000
You're like I just I don't like the taste of coffee. Why would I drink it? Oh my oh

1494
01:56:24.56 --> 01:56:26.88
All right, you know like there's a week that chocolate's got a week

1495
01:56:26.88 --> 01:56:29.88
Not if you don't like the taste you don't like the taste right in a fucking

1496
01:56:29.88 --> 01:56:35.12
I bet when I did drink my friend you drink beer because that's Canadian is the drink beer

1497
01:56:35.12 --> 01:56:40.88
And I'm like beer tastes like shit. I'll drink cider. Oh the apple juice. I'm like it's got more alcohol

1498
01:56:40.88 --> 01:56:42.88
And then beer bitch like it's

1499
01:56:42.88 --> 01:56:47.44
What would he like if he didn't like coffee? He likes white tea. I think white tea sucks

1500
01:56:47.84 --> 01:56:56.000
But I'm not jacco we got this I'm making this protein power right now and like criteria number one was

1501
01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:02.16
Yeah, it has to be good protein and all that but the strong second criteria was it's got a taste so damn good

1502
01:57:02.16 --> 01:57:04.16
Yeah, which

1503
01:57:04.16 --> 01:57:09.36
You forget your drink and protein the first sample tasted really good like I was shocked at how good the first

1504
01:57:09.36 --> 01:57:14.08
And we tweaked it a little bit the second sample came back it tastes even better

1505
01:57:14.08 --> 01:57:18.32
I mean laying on how much sugar we talking there's no sugar. Oh no, there's no sugar

1506
01:57:18.32 --> 01:57:22.64
That used to be the trick. Yeah, this protein's so good. Yeah, but it's a good sugar

1507
01:57:22.64 --> 01:57:30.08
No, no sugar and then the we've got one more coming back, but the second iteration of it tastes delicious

1508
01:57:30.80 --> 01:57:32.96
And yeah samples left no

1509
01:57:33.20 --> 01:57:36.64
Yes, but he's like he's like well, you know, I don't live really like protein powder

1510
01:57:36.64 --> 01:57:39.36
No, I'm like bro, this is nothing to do with you wanting to drink protein powder

1511
01:57:39.36 --> 01:57:44.96
You'll be drinking this like you want a drink out. It's good. We'll be like this. It's so good. Yes, yeah

1512
01:57:44.96 --> 01:57:52.08
All right, so we'll see about that one working get all the shit echo the proof is gonna be in the pudding as they say

1513
01:57:52.48 --> 01:57:58.80
origin main dot com that's where you get it also at origin main dot com you can get you will get

1514
01:58:00.08 --> 01:58:04.56
Keys rash cards this is for due to by the way. Oh, yes, sir made in America

1515
01:58:04.56 --> 01:58:08.48
I know Jody is from Canada better than maiden summer else

1516
01:58:09.04 --> 01:58:14.08
Yeah, I love a can we don't have time to make these and stuff like that make it in America

1517
01:58:14.08 --> 01:58:17.12
There's ten times more people down here. Yeah, I dig it and

1518
01:58:17.76 --> 01:58:26.24
All the stuff on there is made in America. It's good go there see if you want something get something good way to support also fit in his gear

1519
01:58:27.60 --> 01:58:35.08
Jockel that a new kettlebell that is heavier than mine is it his head is it is it your little head that you got on this

1520
01:58:35.08 --> 01:58:40.64
Might as well be dude. That is the greatest if nothing else comes from this this little avatar of you

1521
01:58:40.64 --> 01:58:46.44
I want jockel proof. I want like an emulate of your head. Yeah, they sure it has one right in the back

1522
01:58:46.44 --> 01:58:54.52
Okay, don't go up done. Yeah, it's good. Yeah, the kettlebell should be his head because the reason he got it was because I had a heavier kettlebell

1523
01:58:54.52 --> 01:58:56.52
By happens dense by the way

1524
01:58:56.96 --> 01:59:03.50
I think I can't say everyone just sorry is this a kettlebell like a buy from jocco? No, or this is just jocco bottom

1525
01:59:03.50 --> 01:59:08.08
I was about to say which reminds me every time I'm about to talk about kettlebells a kettlebells

1526
01:59:08.08 --> 01:59:13.32
I have you know the ones from on it. Yeah, I got all of them. Yeah, me too except I don't have the big foot one

1527
01:59:13.32 --> 01:59:18.16
Two, but that was like that's one of my eggs. I can't pick that one up is just too heavy. Yeah, I'm prosthetics

1528
01:59:18.16 --> 01:59:21.40
Yeah, no, I dig it and I haven't picked up anything for over here anyway

1529
01:59:21.40 --> 01:59:24.94
So that's what I was trying to imply to jockel that like since mine is heavy

1530
01:59:24.94 --> 01:59:28.04
I can pick it up. He can't pick it up. Etc. That's two pounds everything

1531
01:59:28.24 --> 01:59:33.54
So that's why he got the heavier one Roger that. Yeah, I'm tracking now. I'm tracking six pounds

1532
01:59:33.54 --> 01:59:39.64
Yeah, congratulations. Yeah, because this was a custom made kettlebell no kind of from rogue fitness rogue right yeah

1533
01:59:39.90 --> 01:59:45.18
My boys at rogue fitness, but it's like made America. It's like the boring round one. You know, you said you have the

1534
01:59:45.66 --> 01:59:50.40
I got the ones yeah, that's why I thought you meant the jocco was coming out with with a kettlebell

1535
01:59:50.40 --> 01:59:56.20
I should obviously it's gonna be shaped like jocco's had should that's my that's my because they could do that and now

1536
01:59:56.20 --> 02:00:02.60
I think a product was just born. Yeah, maybe actually someone someone said that come on. Okay. Anyway. I agree

1537
02:00:02.60 --> 02:00:07.10
It's the longest commercial ever, but it's not a commercial you we deviated from the commercial

1538
02:00:07.10 --> 02:00:12.04
Roger, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, we're supposed to do that. Okay. It's part of the deal right

1539
02:00:12.04 --> 02:00:18.62
I know I forgot. I told you I'm in basic training for life again nonetheless back to the kettlebells if you get kettlebells

Subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already seems normal

1555
02:01:33.42 --> 02:01:41.24
Seems obvious iTunes if you want to subscribe is for subscribing those it's more about like what you listen to you listen to iTunes

1556
02:01:41.52 --> 02:01:47.02
Yeah, that's what it's exclusively. I'm right some people they listen to Google play can you subscribe on Google play though?

1557
02:01:47.02 --> 02:01:48.02
I don't know

1558
02:01:48.02 --> 02:01:55.16
Okay, that's when I was getting that I don't know where else I get so sure it's the same thing. Yes, I do that and now there's different apps now

1559
02:01:55.16 --> 02:01:56.82
Yeah, like they're basically

1560
02:01:56.82 --> 02:02:01.88
I mean different stop you're confusing this is okay consider this way and I this I'm new to this too

1561
02:02:01.88 --> 02:02:10.28
Okay, where iTunes when you think podcast I I pod podcast so podcast or exclusive to iTunes

1562
02:02:10.28 --> 02:02:14.12
It just feels that way right where do you listen to podcast on iTunes?

1563
02:02:14.12 --> 02:02:19.22
Obviously here's the thing podcast the podcast just because iTunes has it's like if you watch

1564
02:02:19.22 --> 02:02:22.62
If I just went to the website what your website again?

1565
02:02:22.62 --> 02:02:23.90
Jockel podcast.com

1566
02:02:23.90 --> 02:02:30.62
So if I go to joga podcast.com could I listen straight from the podcast from the story from the website? Yes on my computer. Yes

1567
02:02:31.22 --> 02:02:34.22
Bob Jericho boom there it is here and

1568
02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:41.50
I did not know yeah, there's basically all these different ways to listen to it and if whatever way you choose to listen to it

1569
02:02:41.50 --> 02:02:43.50
There's where you subscribe

1570
02:02:43.50 --> 02:02:49.56
In the event of these things offering the subscribe option which I think they all do I'm not sure cuz I don't explore all of them

1571
02:02:49.90 --> 02:02:56.14
It's just hotworks so what I'm saying is if you want to subscribe subscribe good way to support also on YouTube

1572
02:02:56.14 --> 02:03:02.46
Which we have a YouTube channel by the way? Jolty Middick right you that not just the video version of this podcast but

He does that well not last night. That's why I was

1582
02:03:32.90 --> 02:03:38.42
There was underneath my plan Roger that yeah, I was gonna say how did you even recognize that's why I wore my friends

1583
02:03:38.42 --> 02:03:43.18
So this is a tactical beaver shirt and it's a Canadian company started by can't so off guys

1584
02:03:43.18 --> 02:03:46.06
Yeah, dude. I was gonna wear this last night

1585
02:03:46.34 --> 02:03:50.14
But I didn't I thought Joggle would show up in T-shirt so I stayed in a T-shirt

1586
02:03:50.14 --> 02:03:54.98
Yeah, yeah, and anyway, so now he's in a T-shirt and I'm in the college. You're all dressed up

1587
02:03:54.98 --> 02:03:56.26

I thought it'd be weird where and you're shirt

1593
02:04:19.86 --> 02:04:22.30
Yeah, I thought so but there's a deeper meaning

1594
02:04:22.30 --> 02:04:26.18
I think the fact that Jockel's head is on my shirt, but and I'm sitting there. You're part of the show

So you got to wear it. Oh, I'll wear it in the house where the echo shirt sometime. Yeah, there's an echo shirt. Yeah, there's my name

1602
02:05:00.14 --> 02:05:04.38
I'm gonna ask you about a mess, Jockel about it. Jockel told me hurry up. I may or may not hurry up

1613
02:05:44.70 --> 02:05:51.98
But if you like something get something good with a support. Also, I don't know if you know about this you might I don't know psychological warfare

1614
02:05:51.98 --> 02:05:58.78
Is that we're gonna be all I mean? I know what it is. Okay. Is this if something it's a new one of Jockel's names?

1615
02:05:58.78 --> 02:06:03.58
Yeah, so psychological warfare is an album that we created with tracks

1616
02:06:04.86 --> 02:06:13.62
Jockel track. Ah play list. Yes a playlist. Yeah, I prefer Malk's tape. Yeah, that makes tape of Jockel's heart

1617
02:06:14.62 --> 02:06:18.46
Essentially, but here. It's for a specific reason right right it's not him playing the ukulele

1618
02:06:18.86 --> 02:06:20.86
Because you can lay you know

1619
02:06:20.86 --> 02:06:25.42
Indeed it's him telling you how to get through certain weak moments

1620
02:06:26.22 --> 02:06:29.14
Oh, it is his his mom his videos

1621
02:06:29.14 --> 02:06:36.18
No, no, no more specific so here's what it is. Okay. I'm actually glad you don't you don't know the specific of it

1622
02:06:36.18 --> 02:06:40.38
Because I mean you can talk about it for 28 minutes. It's actually number one on iTunes by the way

1623
02:06:40.62 --> 02:06:45.02
But you know, oh that yeah, I downloaded that I never listened to it though. Sorry, bro

1624
02:06:45.02 --> 02:06:49.06
You don't need it. I just wanted to see you. My friend. Yeah, you gave the support. Yeah. That's a lot

1625
02:06:49.06 --> 02:06:53.98
But I probably should have let it support you too. I probably should have really what it's for yeah to support you

1626
02:06:53.98 --> 02:06:56.38
I used to you know like you know when you

1627
02:06:57.10 --> 02:07:02.50
Work out and you don't feel like working or you go to work out and you don't feel like I fell in for last 18 months

1628
02:07:02.50 --> 02:07:04.50
Yeah, I'll do it tomorrow

1629
02:07:04.50 --> 02:07:10.94
Yeah, I've been saying that since last October. All right with you. Well, they were 2016. I was saying that so they got I thought that was my biggest weakness

1630
02:07:10.94 --> 02:07:15.66
I come to Jockel. That's the way you do when you don't feel like working out. I mean, I know cool your top

1631
02:07:15.66 --> 02:07:20.98
Job is do I work out. Yeah, and it'll know but there's more to it than that. It's not that simple

1632
02:07:20.98 --> 02:07:24.94
You know and he explained it. I said, you know what we're gonna do. We're gonna record that

1633
02:07:25.42 --> 02:07:28.42
And always that's that was the birth of the psychological warfare

1634
02:07:28.42 --> 02:07:31.82
Exactly what it is. I should I did download it actually when it came out

1635
02:07:31.82 --> 02:07:34.54
I just I forgot I even had it look at the tracks

1636
02:07:34.54 --> 02:07:40.38
Here's what you do look at the tracks and be like because it's not just missing workout. It's like procrastination

1637
02:07:40.38 --> 02:07:41.34
Uh

1638
02:07:41.34 --> 02:07:48.66

1658
02:09:06.16 --> 02:09:12.48
Which means iTunes Amazon music Google play and then of course the first book extreme ownership

1659
02:09:13.52 --> 02:09:18.48
Combat leadership there's a new version out. It's black. It makes it a little bit cooler

1660
02:09:19.48 --> 02:09:21.48
You can get that

1661
02:09:21.48 --> 02:09:23.48
Learn how to lead

1662
02:09:23.48 --> 02:09:26.16
Also beyond the books in the podcast if you need leadership

1663
02:09:26.96 --> 02:09:32.52
Let's say leadership guidance and direction at your company at your business or at your team

1664
02:09:33.20 --> 02:09:40.16
I have a leadership and management consulting company. It's called echelon front and that is what we do we come to your organization

1665
02:09:40.16 --> 02:09:42.16
We assess the situation

1666
02:09:42.16 --> 02:09:45.64
And we get problem solved through leadership

1667
02:09:46.76 --> 02:09:51.88
It's me it's my brother-lave babbling that road extreme ownership with me

1668
02:09:51.88 --> 02:09:57.64
Who was one of the platoon commanders that served with me in the battle of Ramadi?

1669
02:09:58.12 --> 02:10:00.12
It's JP to now

1670
02:10:00.44 --> 02:10:02.44
who was the

1671
02:10:02.60 --> 02:10:05.24
Point man and the lead sniper of

1672
02:10:06.32 --> 02:10:10.92
Delta platoon in the battle of Ramadi. It's Dave Burke who was

1673
02:10:11.64 --> 02:10:18.08
an F-18 Marine Corps fighter pilot top gun pilot top gun instructor top gun senior instructor

1674
02:10:18.08 --> 02:10:24.16
F-16 pilot F-18 pilot F-35 pilot F-22 pilot first

1675
02:10:24.76 --> 02:10:29.24
He sounds like he's pretty good his job. He's not bad. He's the first

1676
02:10:29.84 --> 02:10:32.16
Operational squadron commander for the F-35

1677
02:10:32.16 --> 02:10:36.000
He's the only man in the world qualified to fly all those aircraft

1678
02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:42.16
But none of that matters because what he did was cool was he was on the ground with us in the battle of Ramadi as a

1679
02:10:42.92 --> 02:10:44.92
Anglico team leader

1680
02:10:44.92 --> 02:10:50.04
With his team and was with what what is an Anglico?

1681
02:10:50.04 --> 02:10:56.12
It's it's the guy's at call for fire. They like like your J attack. Yeah, they're J attacks, but the Marine Corps has Anglico

1682
02:10:56.12 --> 02:11:02.92
But they call it an air naval gun fire liaison Roger that. Yep, and that's what he did for us outstanding guy

1683
02:11:03.32 --> 02:11:07.24
He's been on the podcast number 16 to number 69 I believe

1684
02:11:08.68 --> 02:11:12.44
So he's part of the echelon front team as well also

1685
02:11:12.44 --> 02:11:16.12
On top of that there's the mustard it is

1686
02:11:17.40 --> 02:11:23.44
The leadership seminar with us the echelon front team again

1687
02:11:25.96 --> 02:11:30.44
In 2018 we're only doing two musters people think we're going on a rock and roll tour

1688
02:11:30.44 --> 02:11:35.16
We're not going on a rock and roll tour not going city to city is not gonna happen in Cleveland

1689
02:11:35.16 --> 02:11:40.28
It's not gonna happen in Milwaukee. It's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen. It's Andy Eagle this year

1690
02:11:40.28 --> 02:11:46.52
It's a little bit too close. It's gonna happen in Washington, DC May 17th and 18th

1691
02:11:46.52 --> 02:11:49.72
So that's where you go if you're on the east coast east of the Mississippi you come to DC

1692
02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
So you're with today

1693
02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
May 17th and 18th

1694
02:11:55.40 --> 02:11:57.40
If you're west of the Mississippi

1695
02:11:57.88 --> 02:12:05.08
You come to San Francisco October 17th and 18th that's it like I said we're not going anywhere else so

1696
02:12:05.08 --> 02:12:12.36
The reason is because we don't have time to do them. It's to get all the echelon front team together and set it all up

1697
02:12:12.36 --> 02:12:16.60
It's very hard to do because we're working with clients all over the country and all over the world

1698
02:12:17.08 --> 02:12:19.88
So we can't just do musters all the time

1699
02:12:20.12 --> 02:12:24.68
So that's what we're doing to them if you want to come sign up all the four of them

1700
02:12:24.68 --> 02:12:29.88
We that we've had so far have also now these are going to sell out to a hundred percent

1701
02:12:30.12 --> 02:12:32.12
so if you want to come you got to go and

1702
02:12:32.12 --> 02:12:35.40
Register to attend

1703
02:12:36.28 --> 02:12:42.24
Extreme ownership dot com can I reserve two spots right now in Washington? Yes, you can all right cool cool

1704
02:12:47.08 --> 02:12:49.08

1707
02:13:02.52 --> 02:13:06.20
Overcame this little situation. They give a little brief on a situation here had this guy

1708
02:13:06.20 --> 02:13:10.28
There was acting wrong. I took ownership and boom problem solved. I lost weight

1709
02:13:10.84 --> 02:13:18.20
I gained weight. I got a stripe on my white belt in jujitsu and I'm proud. Yeah, and I'm proud

1710
02:13:18.20 --> 02:13:24.68
Yeah, I'm stoked when you get that stripe on the white belt or the blue belt sometimes people get the black belt the brown belt

1711
02:13:25.16 --> 02:13:30.36
But what we see is progression yeah, like I said people lose weight people gain weight people stay clean
