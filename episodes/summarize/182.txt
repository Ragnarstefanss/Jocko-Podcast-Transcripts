But this is like, it's like, especially if you roll with like guys who are like, good. Like if I was all motivational like, you know what you should That like button, you got to smash that thing. Like, hey, if she starts like putting on weight that she doesn't like or something like that, it's kind of my fault. So cotton is like a, it's like almost like a pod that turns inside out like a popcorn almost. And I was like, I still don't want to train, but it was because there was only like, three people there and they were like really brand new at the time. You know, but just, and I'm not talking where someone is shot, but like, you know, just all of a sudden you're taking rounds and you're like, where are those coming from? We'll bring you back on and we'll get, and I know you and I are talking about other guys that we're going to come on and all those stories of those heroes will we'll get them out there because People want to know I want to hear them. What the way if you're writing, it's like, It's like, right into the share, like, subscribe. I mean, there was areas where there was areas where they were taken, IED strikes on vehicles, and like, you know, when in a big IED hits a Humvee, everyone dies or three out of five people die or something like that, I mean, it's very catastrophic. Right now share like and subscribe share like and subscribe share like and subscribe. Well, yeah, you, but you're like, you're like one, two levels like beyond. And, you know, he reflects on how that was just way too many of us like, hey man, you know, tilt, go out and the field will less than 10. It's like 70 burpees and like 40 pushups or something like that. So we had jundies, like you guys had little people, like you had in-ditch force. I guess, you know, we would have Mark 48, which is 762 and then the Mark 46, which is 556, you know, that's basically like a little stoner and a and a and 60. But I've been training with Andy for like the last like three months, you know, more than it. So no one would know that we were in there, that we were taking pictures, you know, like just logistics air, just an aircraft flying somewhere, they'd go in a straight line. Did you, it sounds like you recognize this when you were doing these operations, you kind of knew that this was, I don't know, I guess I'm going to use this word. And that, you know, this is one of the reasons I highlighted this section is, you know, just this is something that, you know, what we talk about complacency all the time. Because if you're afraid, you're going to prepare more, you're going to train harbor, you're going to, you're not going to cut any corners, you're not going to get complacent. Like, I was more worried about guys that were hesitant or I felt like if they were hesitant on the battlefield, that would work out bad for them. So like, and you know, this is, you know, probably within three to 500 meters of view. You know, like you get, you know, when you buy cotton balls? Well, especially when you have training partners that you like and you trust and you, you know, you enjoy what you get from the training where every garnish you got beat down or not. The guys that I always felt like, okay, if someone's aggressive, not not unaffraid and suicidal like that, but So I don't know if you know this, but now it's like a school you go to. Yeah, for the other reason, they don't know it's like a big metal, yeah, jungle penetrator. But then you get like, you know, you're if you're doing jiu-jitsu, then you're starting to get a little infection exposures going on. Like, if you ever said, man, I really don't feel like training. Oh, yeah, it felt good, but you know, it's like quiet professionals, just don't talk about that much. Either way, so I'm thinking, you know, of all the things and then I arrive at the concept of man, in any other situation, you take that kind of like just physical turmoil. Well, I, you know, I'm one of those guys who kind of like cool socks. And he's talking about how much stuff he cared, all this stuff for one of the thing he cared is, you know, eight grenades or something like that. Usually, if you don't feel like training, it's not that you don't feel like training. I'm not looking forward to the next time, you know, like, come on, let's face it. But either way, I'm like, that was it's kind of like a feeling that's very hard to to describe. You know, people some people like to say things. But this idea of, and you know, I also talk to young military guys, young seals, that, you know, they're, they're scared of this, they're scared of that. If you guys ever think about using some kind of pre-rigged like sit harness or something, they were developing those at the time. But something like this, just so people understand, something like this, you're on patrol. I also used to get the feeling that if you were scared like that, if you were scared, and you were going to be hesitant, that was going to be bad. So she'll be like, hey, I don't really feel like doing the workout today. Like, oh, you like to watch street fight videos. They're kind of like that, but more like there's not, they're not in a ball. So now instead of like, you just read it, that's a quick, it is bam bam, you're saying, but now, and then you're drowning, it feels like it's slowed down. And then it went all like pop, being like that. That's like, I always tell them, good, you know, you should, you should be afraid. And actually that kind of is important to note, because you know, if they're like, hey, So a hundred bucks was like a hundred bucks was like a month to pay basically.
