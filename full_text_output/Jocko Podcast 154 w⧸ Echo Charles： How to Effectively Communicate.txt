 This is Jockel Podcast number 154. With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, I go. Good evening. And we are going to go into some Q&A today. Sure. We got a bunch of questions to go through. I asked if anyone on Twitter had questions. And I got a ton of them. So we're going to try and answer some of them. Some people, if you're listening and you ask the question, like, what time do I go to bed? Or what kind of workout do I do? Or something like that. Then I'm not going to answer it now because I've answered it a bunch of other times. There's a lot of fundamental things. Or it's in the discipline you go to freedom field manual. Or you know. So these were some questions that had some of them. Yeah, that we've heard some of them before. Maybe there's a different spin. But some of them I tried to pull back or pull out the fresher type of questions for this. And ones that aren't entirely fresh, I'll try and cover very briefly with whatever the new sort of anglers. Because there is a fact that you go to a class and you learn two or three new moves in Jiu Jitsu. And that's good. But you also review just a arm lock. And that is still beneficial, especially if it's from a new angle or a new instructor. They tell you, hey, you know, you move your hand a little bit further out on their rest if you're going for that thing and it helps you. Sure. So there's little details. Cool. So let's rock an old movie. Cool. First question, can you describe how difficult or no factor? Leaving your family was before deployment. I hate leaving. Okay. Let me just answer that one. Yeah. It sucks leave your family before deployment. That's the way it is. One thing that I've always said is, you know, to guys that we're saying no, I gotta, I'm gonna leave my kids and it's horrible to leave. And I'm like, yep, it is. And they worry about it from the kids perspective. I'm not gonna be around, you know. Well, here's the deal. Men have been leaving to go and fight wars and do what they got to do for thousands of years. And so your kids are gonna be okay. And what good is they will see what you're doing, see your service and your sacrifice and you stepping up and holding the line for the nation. And that will be a lesson that they will learn by observation. And so even they'll be sad. But inside they're learning. They're learning that there's things more important than yourself. And so it's a good lesson to be taught. Yes, is it, is it horrible leave your family? It sure is. But it is a lesson for your kids. And it is a sacrifice you're making for your country. And there are benefits to it. Your kids, you get to come home. And you'll see it and you'll see your kids, you know, be all excited. It's good. It's a good thing. So that's question one. Yes. It's harsh, but it's a worthy cause. Kind of second part to the question. Did you cry when you learned that your childhood friend committed suicide? Well, you were doing but. Okay. Yeah. So I mentioned that on a couple podcasts ago that my friend Jeff killed himself while I was going through ballets. He was a kid I'd grown up with. But I had I'd grown apart from him in the later grades, six, seven, eighth grade and through high school. We kind of grew apart. So I did not, you know, I was I was sad by the situation. But I didn't it wasn't super emotional about it because I we had kind of grown apart and it had been, you know, I was and was now in the Navy. So no, didn't cry, but was definitely sad about the situation. Is it I mean kind of back to that first part, but lean. Isn't like that like a healthy dose of that like good for the kids for sure? Because it's like now they know how to make do, you know, like if dad's there for every little thing kind of thing for sure. And then, you know, the in that middle day comes that you're going to go, you know, leave or the air at least they got to leave, you know, you don't have to depend on kind of dad being there kind of for you. The trials and tribulations and and those things adversity will make kids tougher. That's just the bottom line. So this is a adversity and it's an adversity that kids, you know, they they it'll make them tougher. Make them stronger. Yes, agree. Next wish any good recommendations for cutting back on alcohol. You know, just straight up why would you cut back and not just stop at this point in my life? I don't I don't drink anymore. And I know that some people have an alcohol problem. And so I think trying to cut back if you have an alcohol problem is in a realistic thing to do because you'll take that slippery slope and and just get drunk. Yeah. So I think what you have to do is just stop and I know that and again, I I'm not I don't I don't have a good familiarization to know what it's like to be addicted to alcohol. I didn't even I didn't even really like consciously. Oh, I'm going to stop drinking now. I just stopped drinking because I was out of the navy. I was working a bunch and carrying on and wasn't around those, you know, my bros anymore. Where we'd go out and have a beer. And so if that's not happening, then it's not happening. And that's one thing I'll all say is I know that people that have alcohol issues addictions. They always say you've got to change the people places and things that you do. So the people that you hang around with that like to drink, you can't hang around with them. The place that you go with everyone likes to drink, you can't go to those places. The things that you like to do that involve drinking, you can't do those things. So there you go. I would say stop drinking and hey, if you're an alcoholic, you got to get medical supervision because that's actually you can die if you're an alcoholic and you stop drinking. So you have to you have to like go and get help. But stop. Yeah, a lot of those times those the people who are that far into alcoholism where they stop drinking and they die. That's like usually they don't even want to stop drinking. Usually that's just how I'm drinking usually. But I think I might have more experience on this one. 10 year. But all those things I meant that's like a really concise and it's a good way to put it like the people placing things, right? Actives you would ever. But a big part of it and I said this before where a big part where I would stop drinking it was way easier when I just understood what it was. You know, like understood like why am I just wanting to drink? And why is it that when I start drinking like it's kind of harder to stop? You know, then maybe I don't know the next guy or whatever. And then when I once understood like what's happening physiologically or whatever, I came up with my own little strategy and the big part of it was like oh yeah, like my brain is like tricking me into thinking like yeah that you want this this thing or whatever. That was like a major one and the other one was kind of has to do with the people placing things. It was where if I had a reason not to drink like if I had a workout that I really took seriously the next day or if I was going to record or something, do to do something where to be hungover whatever would really mess me up. It'd be way easier. You know, so back like you know in high school but in college like kin athletics and stuff like that. You never really drink during the week because you had practice the next day. You don't want to be hungover in practice, you know, so it'd be really easy. Yeah, I'm going to drink in today kind of thing. So if you can kind of set up your life where you have like something important that you can kind of look forward to and really care about the outcome of something that's not necessarily mundane in your in your mind because a lot of times that all kind of it's a slippery slope when you're like yeah it's important but it's mundane in your life you'll be like let's see how I can endure it kind of hungover. It's kind of worth it. I'll pay the price now you know what kind of thing. But yeah if you can set up your life where you have something that you find like important to be functioning fully that helps. Yeah, due to. Train, due to one Saturdays. Yeah, it affected me when I was in the teams and we got drinking on Friday and then when I started training due to all the time I didn't want to I wanted to be good to go for due to so yeah I just like started started to stop drinking on Friday and I'd hard. I would say this with due to, I would say compete in due to then because but and I don't know people are different you know there's a spectrum but to me you just I mean all train hungover, due to in fact due to help say hangover. If you can drag yourself out of the house yeah which is actually isn't that hard once you do it once. If you go if you're hungover and you're like oh man I really don't feel like I'm in a due to right now but you just do it the first time you do it that's the hardest time every other time you're like yeah I did it for this easy I'm not gonna be suffering you go you know depending on the level of hangover you're gonna suffer in due to or maybe not after what you used to it. I don't know maybe it's what it out. I was training like at a higher level and I mean like seriously not trying to be like a jerk but like I would this is back when I was training training with Fabio and so Dean and I would choke when we trained for like three hours straight and like hard and so if you're gonna come in and do four rounds yeah you're a little hungover it's no big deal but if you're gonna come in and you're gonna train for you know an hour worth the class then you're gonna roll hard core for for two hours you're not gonna trust me you're not gonna want to be all hungover dehydrated and jacked up mentally. Yeah I dig it and if you're gonna train fat hard then yeah don't you probably it's gonna be hard to drink and I mean that's that's your typical person not gonna train that hard I mean yeah if you're drinking too much if you're a competitive no even people who don't drink don't train that hard typically in my experience I don't know but if you're training for a tournament it's gonna you can take it way more seriously just kind of in the back of your mind you know it's not just like oh you're just the training so again I'm not saying so that's not gonna work if you're just practicing so it won't work I'm not saying that I'm saying people are different and if I use myself as an example like I could I could train I could hang I was I was training with like when I when I'd go training like at auto so whatever with these crazy training sessions yeah I would go slightly hungover go dean every Friday so okay look of course I could probably train better if I didn't drink the night before for sure but I'm just saying as a as a catalyst for stopping drinking that didn't help you it didn't help me as much as it made yeah it didn't even it wasn't even like a catalyst to help me stop drinking it was just the functionality of life yes was oh I've got to do this in the morning cool I'm not gonna get all hammered tonight so I can do better yeah as a human yeah and that's really the format right there where you find so I mean to me you know like you're not like jiu-jitsu just the training if I wasn't if I was competing or I'd easily stop drinking easily but just for the training if I didn't have a competition or whatever it wasn't it didn't help as much as one might think but if I had something like you know if we're recording or something something who that you would think you might be able to even it just depends on how important it is for you to be functioning at the best level you can you know if I get tapped out a few more times and you just it's kind of like whatever so it just depends on who you are as what I'm saying you're like that either way yeah I mean I think that helps but that's gonna be hard either way if you don't have some kind of like format scaffolding in your brain to kind of like a plan you know like a little strategy to be like yeah I'm just gonna drink less just kind of just gonna drink less yeah it's pretty rare that's gonna yeah yeah that's why cut back I don't I say don't cut back to stop you check next question communication is often used as an excuse both under and over oh under communication and over communication for why the direction isn't clear any suggestions on balancing comms communication up and down with the right level of detail here's a jacked up answer the answer to this question of how to balance comms is comms you own balance communication you have to communicate you have to understand hey do you guys know what's going on you need to check and make sure that they know what's going on if they know what's going on great if they don't know then you didn't communicate with them enough if you spent too much time communicating and now they're looking at you with a blank stare like hey bro we got this then you communicated too much so and ask them hey do you understand what's going on cool and if not do you understand why we're doing what we're doing cool all right good I'm gonna let you go do it now so the answer to making sure you're not communicating either too much or too little is communication I hate to say that but that's what it is there can be some of that can be non-verbal communication you know you can observe if you if you give your guys a task and then you go out and observe them and you see that they can execute it really well then you know that you've done a good job communicating that to them if you go out to observe them and they don't know what they're doing and they don't know what's going on and then you realize how I didn't give them enough information I need to communicate more so you don't have to necessarily ask them you can tell through observation and checking on them and seeing where they're at and what they're doing if they actually understand what's going on so yeah that's that's it pretty straightforward get your little feedback loop going yeah that but it is kind of like and I'm gonna use the word again dance it is kind of like a dance though it's an academy yes you can you can communicate too much and you can communicate too little and you have to find the balance thing because if you communicate too much people stop listening to it and then it's no longer communication at that point because it's kind of like if you're sleeping and I'm like hey okay Jocca told me what to do like you you can't hear me it's not going into your brain it kind of has to go in your brain what I'm saying you got to kind of your does you got to catch what I'm throwing yeah and you know and vice versa if we're quote unquote communicating so yeah over to quote quotes around the case it's just a word I'm just alright there you go but if one of those even one of those things isn't happening we're technically we're not communicating so like the whole over communication thing that's like yeah someone talking too much another guy stops listening are you over communicating so far in this spot it's not you know I'm just saying like how you say like feedback you know like that that's an important thing because if you're like blah blah blah blah and how you say the blank stare communications gone communications not going on you look on my face right now yeah like the one that's blanks you know you can't even see back which is good see I'm saying so now I'm clear I'm clear that you want me to move it along see I'm saying it's good communication on your part here's the thing with you and your blank stare in my experience which I have a lot by the way your blank stare communicates way more than just like a blank stare for real yeah Mike Sarelli would we'll tell you all about that like you'll you'll have a whole conversation with me and not even say one single word for real I know exactly what you're saying see like right now I know exactly what you're saying anyway next question that's exactly what I would say actually like I said when taking ownership how can you prevent your boss thinking you're a complete screw up and stop it from escalating to a point where there where he starts blaming you for things you're not actually at fault so this is one of those catch 22 situations where you actually don't think you're at fault so when you actually don't think you're at fault then you're thinking oh I'm just taking ownership so that that's like the cool thing to do that's what I'm trying to use this as to make to improve my situation right I'm gonna I'm gonna quote unquote take ownership and when you quote unquote take ownership but you actually don't believe you're at fault then you're not you're not really taking ownership so when you look around at your mission at your tacit what you're being told to do and you say oh I've got to do this thing oh it didn't go right and I'm gonna take ownership of it and get it fixed if you're just saying that and you don't actually mean it then your boss starts blaming you for it well you you you should feel that way because when your boss blames you for something you know you should be saying yeah boss I know I said that this was my responsibility and this is what I'm gonna do to fix it you shouldn't when your boss starts blaming for you for things you should say well no actually that's not my area of responsibilities what you should say is oh yes boss like I just said this is my fault and here's what I'm gonna do to fix it that's what you do so you actually think about this when you're when you're the type of person that takes ownership of things you actually can't get blamed for the things you can't blame me for things because I'm already volunteering and saying that this was my responsibility and I'm gonna fix it so that's what you do that's what you do you take ownership and you take real ownership which means when there's a problem you look at it and say this is hey this is my fault here's what I'm gonna do to fix it and when your boss says hey yeah yeah this is your fault you go I know boss I know 100% and this is what I'm gonna do to fix it and then you go fix it yeah and the thing that I didn't know is I said this before too but I think it's easy to sort it forget when especially if you're thinking like this which is which I dig man is the whole what am I gonna do to fix it because when you when you like for real take ownership whatever it's because man just like I said it's almost like what you just said where where you say you can't blame me you can't blame me because I already took responsibility kind of thing because and in a big way it's not necessarily about blame it's more about fixing problems that course on a come up nothing's perfect you know so now it's like it's more of like a way of dealing with problems less than a whole blaming take blame in culture in business in terms of really for blaming each other yeah that's what happens and if you're the person that says hey you know what this is actually my fault and this is what I'm gonna do to fix it there you go yeah then that blame you you could say yeah blame me I'm the guy because that's the guy that made this mistake yeah yeah and then you can just focus on fixing the problem and you're meant to that and that's the thing is the reason I bring it up is because it is easy to forget that part because that blame is still in the problem part yeah yeah yeah with extreme ownership I mean up here obviously because it's like hey I took in kickstream ownership like why yeah why didn't you do how are you saying it's my fault yeah yeah yeah that's not the main part of me and part is like you gotta fix it yeah you know yeah I think so all right next next question I have two warrior kid daughters who are very much on the path with pretty much everything but snacking they're they're starting to put some weight on as a result despite tons of physical activity and good eating at meal time how can I coach them in this area without being overbearing I would say don't have snack food in your house that's junk which you probably do don't and yeah that's that's real simple what are they gonna do if there's no snack food in house how are they gonna snack you know the answer is they're not because they can go out and eat grass from the yard if they're still hungry but so that's that's one thing the other thing is you got to be careful with with kids and I'll say this with girls especially you start throwing that like hey you need to watch your weight you can really mess with their body image so you got to be really careful about what you're doing with the kid with a with a little girl guess what little girls little boys guess what they are when they're when they're little the little pudgy little creatures you know and sure there'll be some genetic kids that are have 2% body fat and a 12 pack of abs when they're 6 years old but most kids are like little little bit pudgy that's part of their prepping for their growths perk and if you're all freaked out about it you know just what you're gonna do is you're gonna put that in their head they're gonna start looking in the mirror and you don't want to do that to your kids so don't have any junk food snacks in the house give them some milk right give them some warrior kid milk because it tastes delicious it is like a snack and it's good for them and it'll be it'll be satiating I know you don't like that word echo but it'll satiate them and it'll make them feel full so that's that's a good kind of snack food to have in the house and if you're gonna have other snack food then make it beef jerky make it some health these you know some carrots some some celery you know make it some good healthy stuff but um yeah like worrying about your kids starting to put on some weight when they're I don't know how old they are in this particular case but just be careful you don't want to you don't want to freak your kids out and get them with a with a really paranoid body image especially girls they're getting it from million different directions and you gotta be careful with it because that's a real that can be turned into a real problem and the thing that that actually you clarified really good to me one day where when you kind of implement change you know in a routine is especially if snacking is kind of like a routine you know whatever when you implement change like it's good there's gonna be some hiccups there you know like whether be I don't know in this case like complaining like hey well you know you're saying hey don't keep snacks in the house so now there's no chocolate cover pretzels anymore you know like hey I remember the chocolate cover pretzels they were right there in the little pantry right there now they're gone like what up I haven't seen them in days yeah like hey we're not doing the chocolate cover pretzels anymore yeah or whatever there's gonna be some blowback there especially from the little kids you know they can be like well at that you know there might be some complaining so I think if we go in or when we go in knowing those things that helps a lot so you're kind of prepared for you know you can kind of plan what you can say are hanging hands in way to intense with this but there's no chocolate covered pretzels guess what they didn't have met the store I'm not getting them they're bad for us yeah I did it but a lot of times when you have you know two girls or whoever you get a lot of bar yeah but they're not getting your kids like pull up bar train yeah but they're not gonna be like hey oh well no chocolate pretzels oh I'll just do pull ups it doesn't work like that with the little kids you got it not that big of a deal to take to pull a snack out of your house yes I don't especially if you get some beef jerky and you're like oh you know what that's a bad for us and I don't want to eat anymore so I got beef jerky here it's really good taste it yes but to be great see weed deal the dried seaweed oh yeah like you used to eat that stuff like it was like they were damn octopuses but that's good there okay bye yeah yes I like the dry seaweed yeah it sounds pounding some of that the other day with both my kids they're like in salty delicious anyway what I'm saying is I'm not saying necessarily make it a huge deal I'm just saying if you're ready for the blowback you know because what if you're not ready you think that okay I'll agree with you just to to we can move this conversation along in order to prep for you stop the chocolate covered pretzels and you don't really agree you can come up with a a plan of action little plan of action and immediate action drill when that six year old goes dad where are the chocolate covered pretzels you have a very well-rehearsed response you can do some roleplaying with your wife and you go yes see let's see what you're doing in the moment I'm telling you this helps this will help okay because you you know the the pork is you care you know you care about the short term a little bit too you know of course a long term you know that's what you're doing the whole thing but you gotta do is explain hey you know what hey we're not doing that anymore because it's not good for us okay straight up cool there it is that's not a huge well we're doing it anyway roleplay with your wife no next question why isn't MMA or did you to a bigger component of law enforcement training just seems to be a huge missed opportunity yeah it certainly is a huge missed opportunity I I plead with all law enforcement personnel to train Brazilian GJ2 MMA wrestling boxing Mojtai as much as you possibly can and I plead with law enforcement agencies of all types that I talk to to get these types of programs in your departments because there is no doubt that it will help you it help your officers be better and more prepared to handle situations on the street just had a police officer coming here the other day that was just signing up and you know she just got down to the police category and I'm so thankful that she's here because I'm like yes go and start training immediately and it will be so beneficial for you in your career in your life and one thing about all these things and any form of martial arts for like self defense or self defense situations or you know because that's sometimes when it turns into for a police officer they're no longer you know once you things things cross over from where they're on offense to where they're on defense and for a police officer this is a great example like this was a female and hey could a female 118 pound female police officer take a guy that was drunk slightly drunk a wrestler whose 240 pounds the answer is no she's not gonna farewell in that situation but if she knows if whatever she knows if she knows if she's trained she might be able to prolong that conflict long enough for her backup to arrive she might be able to stay alive keep control of her gun whatever you know keep control of the situation long enough that she that she will get her backup there so that right there that's the same thing I tell females that want self defense it's like hey look I'm not saying you can't because you look at some of our female jujitsu players they will choke out a dude deflect straight up they will arm lock them like for real and a 200 pound wrestler they'll put a guitino on them and choke them put them sleep so that's that can happen that's what someone that's really skilled to make up for their lack of strength and lack of size being a female but what if even if you're not that good but you can post phone you can prolong someone trying to grab you and take you somewhere someone trying to do something to you you can prolong it the longer you can delay the the offense from taking place the better chance you have of somebody else coming along or somebody noticing or that person just giving up because most most criminals are you know weak minded and they don't want that kind of resistance so yes totally you're asking why isn't it there's a bunch of reason why it isn't and one of them and I've talked about this before but there was there's been cases where people that were not trained enough they were trained enough to be dangerous where they've choked guys to death and that has happened you crush someone's windpipe you can be screwing around and or you just not screwing around but you can be screwing around you could you know you and I could could start wrestling around if you and I were white belts and we started going out at really hard there's a chance one of us could get the other one in a chokehold had a couple drinks in us and next thing you know I put you to sleep which is oh yeah I'm gonna put you to sleep because sometimes you choke your friend you're like I'm gonna put you to sleep well if I'm drunk and you're drunk and I put you to sleep and I don't really know that you're a sleep yet and I'm squeezing extra hard because I'm drunk next thing you know I look up and all of a sudden your highway bone is crushed your wimppipe and you're now gonna die so that's happened in law enforcement they've banned chokes which is a horrible thing because choking is a is one of the best and most minimal forces to use to subdue someone is to choke them even an armlock is gonna break their arm it's gonna ruin their tendons it's gonna hurt them a choke doesn't even hurt someone it just puts them to sleep just make a pass so but that's one of the reasons why they don't teach it as much the other reason is they don't give enough training to law enforcement officers and they need to they train an absolutely pathetic amount of time in what they call defensive tactics generally they please officers call defensive tactics which is them fighting and maintaining weapon retention and all that they train a very small number of hours a year they measure the time that they train in in a year in hours that's how little they train so my my campaign I'd like to go forward with is I think that police officers should spend one fifth of their active duty time training one fifth of their time should be training that's the way it should work and I don't know how I'm gonna start that ground wave but there's that's such a solid idea that no one can argue against it there's not one single argument against every police officer spending one fifth of their time training and and if you want to argue with me about that and the argument is well we won't have enough police officers out on the beat then and here's the question back at that would you rather have eight highly qualified highly trained officers out on the beat or ten officers that were barely trained at all and the answer is so easy that question so that's a bunch of things I'll continue to push that as much as I can and I know a ton of law enforcement people listen to this and just you know I think that's a great idea to start pushing from the ground from the grassroots we want one fifth of our time training it's going to make us all better it's going to prevent think of all the time that's hours that are wasted in legal actions after there's a bad shooting or an injury or something like that think of all the stuff that gets wasted there take the officers and train them properly that's what that's what needs to happen so hopefully it will and then what would you suggest that I mean kind of isn't what you can say but suggest like you know police officers going and getting training on their own so like you know yes if you have to go get training on your own go get training on your own because most due to places they'll have a law enforcement like some kind of you know yeah yeah yeah actually this guy you know Craig right and now me yeah yeah yeah okay police officer up in Oregon and from not mistaken always doing due to like with his uniform on and you can look look look him up on Instagram you can see all the stuff he does with due due to any applies it to law enforcement yeah yeah and it like man it's such a clear demonstration of the benefits and you know whatever everyone who trains like you know it's like man it becomes really after you train for a while all this dealing with other people in chaotic situations right he's literally easy yeah it's easy so man yeah get watch Craig and his stuff and I don't and here's the thing though I don't know how that works with like work and you know hey you're at risk of injury I don't know I don't know what the whole deal is but man the way I say it man trains or Craig's over there training all the time train and so man yeah just train on your own until your situation arises with the law enforcement yeah well hopefully they'll implement that sometime in the future man next question bow or not okay and due to his three months in professor not bowing I don't other practitioners bow no one told me when in Rome versus I'm not in a herd respect a professor mats and practitioners this pretty simple question some people bow when they go on the mat some people bow to the professor some people don't I don't I just kind of do whatever and it doesn't really matter to me and there's a little bit of paranoia in the question which I I understand which is like hey hey when in Rome do his Romans do but at the same time you know I'm going to hold the line kind of on my personal value so it's like I don't I'm not bowing right that's not my gig or I it's respect you got about like there's both those extremes and both of them can be articulated in a way that's fine and to me I'm just like whatever oh everyone looks like everyone's bound cool in the bow and not that big of a deal I don't I don't freak out about it it's not that big of a deal I think it to me to me the overall arching principle of my actions bowing or not bowing is more based on my overall principle of not making a spectacle out of myself one way or the other like I'm not here to like draw attention and be like hey I don't bow or hey this is jujitsu you need to respect them that I'm like over here just trying to train yeah not trying to make a big deal out of myself yeah so if everyone's bowing it's that cool like they know no big deal I get it or if no one's bowing and it's like hey I don't know big deal yeah I guess people might be disappointed better I have some hard stance right yeah but I don't yeah there's there's some things I don't worry about that's one of them yes I believe that yeah how about we just trade yeah agree and that's that'll sort of itself out anyway because if you're at a school because some schools sort of require that's the protocol here at the school no big deal but you can have that exact attitude be like cool that's what we're doing that's cool because some people you bow on the mat you bow off the mat you at the beginner class to the you know to the picture whatever at the end like the whole deal but same deal it's like bowing's not hard to do it doesn't like you know affect your family life at home or nothing like that it's just just bow same thing we're not bowing doesn't affect your yeah it's not hard to not bow down now I guess there's a line in either direction right there you know where you could you know you could be telling me like okay when we bow you need to bow and you need to praise yeah praise the praise instructor whoever it's like hmm okay probably not I'm probably not gonna do that you know like we're not we're not worshiping right we're not bowing it's like okay a little sign respect cool I got that but we're not gonna turn a respect into a worship there's a line that that will not be crossed the other direction is like oh you know someone's teaching a class and I'm just gonna you know run my mouth and walk on a mat like it's no big deal now like you're gonna be respectful to the instructor of course so I'm just gonna find out little balance there balance those two dichotomies so what if you go as a guest or whatever and another place and there their protocol is in your opinion like sorted crossed over to worship I haven't really been through an academy or whatever in worship but let's say it did just a little bit like would you go as a guest do you just go through the motions of respect for I might what I would probably do is go through the motions but then do other actions that would indicate to everyone that I have a free mind and that I'm not down with what they just did type of scenario like I wouldn't be obnoxious about it but I'd be like oh you know what I'm gonna do is take off my gear and sit on the mat right now like yeah oh oh that's not a lot okay sorry cool oh my bad though yeah you know big they put it on like I you know cool whatever just kind of like just indicate would you say at my academy like we don't care about these small things yeah maybe like um I don't know if I do that because then you're just trying to try to again make a spectacle I'm not trying to make a spectacle man I'm just trying to just try to just try to be you know just trying to get some training and to be honest with you I just go get training yeah so don't make a spectacle and get in the wet and let that spectacle get in the way of your training yeah how often are we making I mean how often do people try and make spectacles out of themselves it's like people do that yeah and that's not cool like don't do that don't be a spectacle just be you know I thought a story before about the the when I went to the University of San Diego and there was a professor there that was like oh she was an American but she was a Buddhist monk right you know so she had at some point converted to Buddhism and and she would shave her head and walk around in the robes and stuff like that and I was like we know one of the tenants of you know being Buddhist is to like not make a spectacle for yourself and yet here you are walking around a western campus you know you know in a uniform with a shaved head that's not that's not that you are making a spectacle of yourself so I was just like I would I would think it would be more like the Buddha to just wear you know a pair of jeans and a t-shirt and just have like whatever normal just be a normal just like as normal as possible yeah there's a whole like there's a whole thing that's sort of my that's sort of I I fall into a I fall back on that you know like a lot yeah so because you think that she might argue well this is how a some Buddhists like minimalize our whole efforts to have individuality or whatever but at the end of the day you are yeah like we're just like when you're in Thailand which is awesome like the Buddhist monks they're everywhere and they're that's what they do and so they're not making a spectacle of themselves at all and they come around and get rice in the morning it's very cool it's a very cool culture but if you're in a culture of a Southern California university there's no other Buddhist monks that are walking around so you kind of and hey maybe I'm wrong you know I'm not trying to disparage you know this individual I'm just saying from my perspective I was like if you really want to have the the low profile and not bring attention to yourself and give up you know give up the the trappings of ego right you want to give up the trappings of ego then you don't want people to notice you if you don't want people to notice you you dress like a gray man you just just like kind of normal you know forgettable yeah so anyways I'm trying to get like deep into the religious aspect of jiu jitsu and robes sure but that's just kind of my opinion I dig it next question did you ever have cct did you ever have a cct attached to your unit and if yes how was having them alongside and what advantages did they bring to the battlefield so cct is an air force combat controller and their special operations guys they're awesome guys they go through really hardcore training and I didn't really I worked with them occasionally not very directly on a couple occasions they were great guys but I never worked with them enough to to be talking about them all the time because I just didn't have that experience you know and don't talk about bull riders either because I don't know many of them you know so it's just it's just it's that but they're great guys I know they have an awesome reputation and my friends that work with them loved work with them if there was a guy that was I've had a couple guys kind of heard names of so for as far as coming on the podcast yeah of course I never fallen on the podcast of uh with our question no problem and what we what we had was we had anglico which was Dave Burke and his guys they were the guys that were doing the cct type mission for us when we were in remoddy so uh that's one of the reasons why we didn't work with them very much on that deployment the previous deployment we had my own I had my own jac and that's who we worked with so just just just uh just didn't have that opportunity so they're awesome guys though. Next question juggle currently in a busy and stressed place in life and keep looking back at what could have been how do you bounce back to doing you and not getting in your own head appreciate what you and I could do thank you both for and got blessed. All right you know we can look back all day long at what could have been and it doesn't matter well the only thing that matters from the past is what you learn from it so let's learn from it and look at the future and one one thing I'll say is it's like they're saying about when's a good time to plan a tree do you know when the good best time to plan a tree is right now either 22 years ago or right now right like that's look you didn't do it then so guess what you can do you do it now when's the best time to start a savings account. Yeah the same thing like I you know 20 years ago or right now so if you sit there and say oh well I could have done if I wish I would have done this years ago I wish well guess what you look up at a year and you don't have that little sattling now you could have a little sattling right you're nothing so it's not that big of a deal hey hey you you you went through life you made some you wasted some time good you didn't waste it completely first of all you learned from it you got experience you had fun you did other things you you learned about you learned about relationships because some girl dumped you and you realize that you can't overcome it to a to a liar you know you like you learned these things right so just because things were negative experiences in the past and they didn't feel good to go through doesn't mean that they were all bad because you still took something away from you and you learned from it so that's part one part two is what are you going to do plan a tree today that's what you're going to do plan a tree today and start to nourish that tree and take the lessons that you learned to sprinkle on that tree and feed that tree so it can grow fast that tree that you plant today should be able to grow faster than the one you would have planned 20 years ago because you have the knowledge on how to on how to nourish that tree and feed that tree so it can grow quicker so just get on the path don't don't play around with what's going on in the past learn from it move on you man that goes along with how like that little speech it wasn't a speech but a little talk you had with me about you know you got to play the long game or whatever and in kind of in this case same deal where it's kind of in more so than even play that you are playing the long game but keep the long game in mind because that's what you know those thoughts like dang I should have I should have went to college or I should have chinointica I don't know whatever this whole what could have been kind of deal that's like your mind saying like right now if I would have done that back then right now I would have this and that's the part that kind of message like jams you up mentally right where you're like man I could have had this right now so when you think so you don't you so as a result typically in my experience anyway which is almost none but typically I think like wait I because when I think of what could have been because of this thing that I kind of want right now I don't want a seed right now I want what I could have had and that's what I want I have that so point to see yeah so but like I emotionally or mentally you that's not where your mind is your mind isn't like hey I can't have that I accept that so let's you think of the future now your mind doesn't do that it's more like hung up on on that right of what you don't have right now that empty void that you have you don't want to feel that void with a seed the seed doesn't do nothing for me that even a sapling that's a full grown tree that's what I want right now that's what I could have had so how is a seed the problem or or the solution to my problem but if you're looking at the big picture the long game is you so I'll like pointly put it at the better the seed is nothing but a tree at a different time that's really what it is seems aimed so that is the problem that is a solution seems aimed and that might be the most philosophically bold and and unbounded statement you've made on this the seed is nothing but a tree at a different time like I did that good job it's all the more fit the pain and suffering listening has finally paid off good good cool man thank you anyway so yeah I think if like you can keep that long game in mind that's helped me like a lot with just even like small little things you know stuff is like uncomfortable I want to do this right now but you know this exact thought like man I'm I'm looking forward to the day that I'm not I'm thinking the opposite of what could have been I'm thinking now I'm thinking I'm so glad I planted that seed last year or whatever you know so you can look at the long game and kind of fulfill all that stuff sure all right anyway next question hi jockel and echo and name is both by the way here but hi jockel and echo quick question I really get I get really bad anxiety doing almost everything for example when talking to people I always feel like as if I'm gonna say something stupid and this makes me start to stutter and lose my train of thought and I just go blank hey it's on that one first of all you got a condition yourself you know you got a practice you got a rehearse I'll actually first of all I would say go get some speech therapy if someone to help you out because that will that will be beneficial to you getting someone that's a professional to to come in and say like okay here's the drills that we're gonna do my buddy that drums in my band he there's drumming drills that you can do so you can get your left hand to do something different than your left foot and your right hand to do something there's drills that you can do to overcome because if you're like me you're not a drummer I my right hand and right foot are gonna do the same thing at the same time my left hand and my left foot are gonna do the same thing at the same time but there's drills that you can do to overcome that and there's drills that you can do with speech so you can practice and you rehearse and you think about it then you'll get better at it and the cool thing is like once you start to build some confidence then you get more and more confident and you'll get better and better it the other thing I would say is talk about things that you know right don't try and explain things that you don't know don't try and come up with some theory that you don't understand and try and just roll it out off the tip of your tongue because you don't know it so just when that's happening just sit back and kind of formulate your thoughts and think okay of all the things I'm thinking right now what do I actually kind of have a grip on maybe it's a question sometimes forming something in a question will make it easier for you to state it because you're saying hey I got a question and now you're not putting pressure on yourself to come up with this perfect yarn of why that you this theory that you out instead you post something as a question that'll take some pressure off you and talk about things that you know and if you don't know it then ask a question about it and that'll get you more comfortable and you keep talking and keep trying and over time you'll get better and better at it but yet you have to you have to not jump in like don't go and volunteer to give the speech at the local club right no volunteer to when people are having a conversation say hey can I ask a question about this start with that that's like the easiest entry point no it's expecting you to say anything brilliant when you ask a question then it's expecting you to ask a question yeah so it's not that big of a deal and then just build on that man it's exposure therapy exposure therapy next wish when you transitioned from E to an O how did your approach working with with man you previously served with as enlisted now that you were an officer this is such an easy question because the bottom line is when I transferred from being an enlisted guy to be an officer I didn't change anything in the way that I treated everyone I treated people the same and when I was a young enlisted guy or senior enlisted guy well more senior I was never like a I only made it to E five before I went officer but when I was in my third platoon with other guys that were not in their third platoon I treat people like hey man with you know hey this is what we're gonna do this how we're gonna make it happen now I gotta caveat that for the guys that were in pltunes with me when I was in the E five mafia hey I was a little crazy with the hazing and like you did suck to be a new guy in one of my platoon so I get that but as you guys have told me you appreciate it once you got a little you know once you saw the big picture there was appreciation but no from a from an actual working relationship hey you know what are you gonna do you gonna stay humble you're gonna treat people with respect regardless if you're above them or below them in the chain of command there's this saying that I didn't talk about when we had Derek a Raron and it's it's pulled from that speech by Jacqueline by gunnery sergeant Jacqueline he says at the end of the speech he says not above you not below you always beside you so think about that from a leadership perspective not above you not below you always beside you so then if you have that attitude look I'm not above when I'm not above you and I'm not below you like where equals and we're trying to figure out how to best solve this problem and if you treat people like that regardless if you're above them or below them in the chain of command you'll treat with respect and humility you'll be fine and that's what I did I didn't treat anybody any different and I mean I had I had guys that worked for that worked for me that had been my peers or that I had worked for before when I when I went through that transition and it was like no factor it was literally no factor because these guys were you know when we were friends we worked together we focused on getting the job done when they were above me in the chain of command what did I do I worked hard to focus on getting the job done when they were below me in the chain of command oh no it's like hey they're working hard did they become a less of a person did I become more of a person no no I put a different rank on my sleeve what does that mean nothing it doesn't mean it it means yeah what does it mean it means that I'm going to be given this brief instead of some other guy cool no big deal you know what why don't you give the brief I'm fine with that yeah so yeah respect humility and never above you never below you always besides you it's a good little thing to think about there okay did you ever have the situations where you throwing darts at the guys back at the bar you know for your hazing situation no sure we did some pretty we did some pretty rough hazing though for sure you know lots of yeah it was it was not fun it wasn't fun it wasn't fun you know and and it was part of the ritual back in the day it's not as much as it any as it is not as much as that anymore but you know guess what guys are fighting a war now so I'm not like oh little guys don't have it or sorry guess what when I got when I was in the teams it when I first got to the teams it was like oh cool you're in the teams yeah you're gonna get hazed oh guess what these guys are getting nowadays they're gonna get shot at they're gonna get you know hit with iEDs so not that big of a deal it's just a little bit of a culture change and that's the way it is next question that caught a minute of leadership has some great principles what is an appropriate philosophy concerning time to train versus manage out a direct report when they have been in the role for over a year yeah this changes from industry industry to industry to spend depending on the situation that you're in and sometimes you don't have you have a really tight timeline to get people up to speed and if they don't get up to speed you got to get rid of them otherwise it's gonna cost the team or it's gonna cost the company money so how long you're gonna give them you're gonna give them as much time as you think you can give them before they start detracting from the team you're also gonna make sure that you're not investing so much time in a one person to try and get them up to speed that you're ignoring everyone else and now it's having a negative impact on the team so you just gotta look at the timing again I work with construction companies where if they don't get a job done on done on time it'll cost them $60,000 a day they don't play around like they're using someone that's going to be able to get the job done you get some sales organization that's commission only and there's somebody that's taken a while to get up to speed they don't really care it's not cost in the company anything so you got to figure out in your industry how much time that looks like and then you got to set the expectations clearly and once you've done that you say okay listen bud I've been working with you for this amount of time here's where I want you to be at this date if you don't get there we're gonna move you out man it's the way it is pretty straightforward next question I have to co-exist at times with an individual who knows I'm X Army he purposely makes pro-tally band quips to piss me off as I'm in a position I can't do much about it his intent to anger works but I don't show it what's some advice yeah I mean this guy's just just I would just completely ignore you know and actually you know hey that's funny man cool he's obviously trying to get under your skin and just don't let him get under your skin that's just all there is to it this person is worthless and just ignore him I mean you could go to the extreme of taking like in marks mission where mark actually gets in on the joke you know and if you want it you know but then you might be crossing again I don't know the specifics of the situation because there's times where that's not like I wouldn't do that in certain situations like like no I'll ignore you but I'm not gonna play along with this joke the way you're saying it but there's times where I be that oh yeah guess what you know I might play along with a joke just to diffuse it again if this might be a this might be a guy that doesn't deserve that but yeah ignore it man go don't even worry about this idiot that's that's my advice yeah that ignore thing you do that super good where it's literally like you feel like you don't you got no feedback from my little joke like if I make a joke to you or something and it's almost like did he not hear my joke because he just sort of moved on you know kind of thing and it's really compelling me to like not tell that joke anymore you know kind of thing and I'm assuming it works really good actually and he actually did have an example like the guy would say hey you're aiding the Taliban with this with the check this week like I don't know if the check is junk or this week's check anyway yeah so it seems like he's trying to be funny you know like he's not trying to be a dick to the guy like he says he's purposely trying to piss him off and yeah so for me if you're purposely trying to piss me off pitting me getting pissed off is you running that's the thing I'm not gonna let that happen yeah you're gonna win how am I gonna win by not getting pissed off yeah and you're a little and you're ignore tactic that you do in real life by the way yeah and I'm not saying like the ignore where you're like like a little kidty horse like a little kidty glee just ignore him and they like turn their back now it's like yeah you know just like yeah just like meaning was like you're your little quips literally mean nothing to me whatsoever yeah and that's a skill too which apparently you've honed over the years because it is and you gotta you can't oversell it you can't oversell ignoring somebody otherwise you're like you're not ignoring I got the power so you can't oversell it and you know underselling ignoring means like you're not really ignoring I guess but if you can nail it if you can nail it like literally your joke or your comments or whatever are falling on deaf ears you know and they don't like affect me at all if you can nail that yeah I would say that that would compel the normal person or this kind of person whatever to stop it where I think that works with everybody even little kids once again you don't make a spectacle out of yourself you're gonna let it roll like you're not making a spectacle of like I'm ignoring you don't make a spectacle of like hey shut up you just play in the metal and you just go through the because because there's things in life that don't matter yeah I'm not saying that you that there's that there's things that you don't react to because there certainly are and I'm not saying that you want to be this neutral person through for all things but there's things that just don't matter yeah there's things that just they just don't matter this is one of them this guy doesn't matter what is who is this guy yes it matter so don't put any effort into them just stay neutral oh give him a smile on a nod and keep doing what you're doing another tip too for this don't tell other people like oh yeah no man you forgot about that never totally just forgot about never tell anyone when something pisses you off never you know that way because if you do and then you're you're nailing the ignore tactic you're nailing oh yeah delivery perfectly and then you tell you told your friend or whatever like hey so that guy knows that always just ignoring me but I really pisses him off you know so just keep doing it and and here's the thing too about playing the game like um or or going along with the joke like oh yeah that's funny you just basically you kind of involve yourself in the game yeah he's not getting the payoff necessarily but he'll just change his tactic because you're still in the game with all you want to you want to get out of the game that's why that's why in that particular situation you know mark in Mark's mission was trying to befriend yeah yeah yeah yeah so that's a different situation he's not just trying to diffuse or he's trying to actually befriend him and so then he need to make a connection let's the clear difference if this guy was like a coworker or a boss or a subordinate then trying to build a relationship with then I might take a little step you know and again am I gonna joke about somebody being pro-talibant I'm not probably joking about the Taliban very much probably not no yeah cool next question is it better to remain single if you have a dangerous or demanding career in order to protect your family from unintended negative consequences or find a partner willing to embrace the risk and raise where your kids together hey man it's hard to live the life and it's a lot harder on your family than it is on you because you'll be over getting after it and your family will be at home not knowing what's going on with you so it's hard but I mean obviously having kids and raising a little warrior kids with a partner that's in the game is is awesome it's hard to find someone to get married to that's that good to go in the game especially if they're really young so I got real lucky I married a girl that kind of got it we'll say and and I said this when I was on Ben Shapiro's show that the quality that she had that still has that I think is is the most important is emotional independence and I don't even know if that's the thing I don't know if I just made that up but that's trying to describe that you know my wife doesn't need the the hey honey from me she doesn't need to like a hey how's everything going she doesn't need that from me she's fine she's emotionally independent and of course she's independent in the way that she can take care of whatever the kids and the puking kids and the kids diapers and the kids with and the broken water heater and the flat tire on the cause you can handle all that stuff too when I was gone a lot but most important is she could she she didn't need the constant like emotional recharge from me because she's an independent stable human being of her own so I think that's the kind of thing you've got to look for now unfortunately a lot of times dudes are attracted to the person that's emotionally dependent on them because it makes no it's a little ego boost it makes him feel good like oh she needs me around and it's like that's so you got to watch out for that you got to find someone that kind of has their own thing going on which also has to be balanced because if you find a female that is too has too much independence then guess what she's gonna be around you can find somebody else so you got to find that balance as well but if you can find that that right person don't rush into it take your time and and and she's in the game then yeah man get after it gonna say that's a good question yeah it is like and you know a lot of times guys guys and here's another like this is just an it's an answer that's not really an answer and yet it's fully an answer hey I'm married and I'm thinking about going the seal team to what will this do to my marriage it's like oh there's a 50% chance your marriage is gonna get destroyed because you're gonna be gone all the time your wife is gonna be jealous of the teams she's gonna be jealous of the travel she's gonna be pissed that you're not home she's gonna be pissed that when you get home you're going to the bar with your boys instead of going to the recital for the daughter like that's that's a reality so yeah I can't recommend it at the same time if you're square away and you have a good relationship yeah it'll be awesome it'll be awesome but it's it's a really hard like when guys when I meet a guy that's 19 years old 20 years old and he says yeah you know I'm going to buds and I'm getting married this summer before I go straight up that's a bad idea that's a bad idea don't do that if you're not situation don't do that because if you are if you have a great relationship with that person say look I'm gonna go through buds I'm gonna be focused on that it's gonna take me some time I'm gonna show bit of team I'm gonna go on deployment I'm gonna come home it's gonna take about three years for all this to happen when we get done with all when I get done with all that we'll get married because we are so strong and so tight that we can get through three years without you know being married we cool let's see what kind of response you get for that because it's non-committal right because it's showing the female hey I'm non-committal when actually you're saying listen it's not that I'm non-committal I don't even know what I hold in the future I don't know what the future holds for me it's gonna be crazy I don't know what's gonna happen I don't want to drag you through a bunch of crap let's just pause on moving forward with the marriage part and once we get done with that you know give me give me two years give me three years and then you can see if you still want to be around you you think you want to be around right now you haven't had a you haven't had a dude that's going on deployment for seven months after he gets done with it one year work up where I was gone in 12 months I was gone nine months that's a whole another thing you you may not want to be in that situation you know maim so if you're in that situation yeah don't get married and do people pull it off sometimes yeah Flynn Cochrane got married I think before buts and so that's that's one guy but but it's a rare occasion and most of the time it doesn't work out as well as Flynn and it worked out for Flynn why did it work out for Flynn one of the reasons he married a girl that is emotionally independent and can do her own thing and wasn't waiting on you know that that that emotional boost you know so there you go and so it's and and here's the the final answer it's like you know what the right answer is you actually know it so many questions you actually know the answer too you want reinforcement of them and but but the only person that can answer these questions is you the person you got to listen to what I'm saying sure but you got to look at your future spouse and be like or potential spouse you're the one that knows mm-hmm now what's hard is guys especially guys they go head over heels for females yeah they go crazy they go nuts they don't even see straight yeah you can't I had guys in seal platoon where I was like listen hey bro this girl that you're involved with right now is going to ruin your life I want to tell you that let me tell you what she's done so far you're not married yet I know you want to get married in two weeks so far she stole your credit card she's called the command four times to request to talk to the master chief about your orgars this girl is a nightmare please do not marry her and guys like bro you don't understand and that's the way guys do and how do I know that because I was the same idiot when when you're 15 years old oh my god it's the only no it's like no that's not the only girl it's not there's more so just calm down if you can if you if the marriage is meant to be let it be but let it be in a year let it happen in here don't be getting married in three months don't be getting married in two months don't don't don't get married in six months get married in a year get married in a year and a half do me a favor do yourself a favor do us all the favor that there you go sounds like sound advice thank you next question could you talk about how you read a book to get so much out of it that you do oh yeah um here's what I do in a read a book i read the book as i'm reading the book i highlight the important parts of the book then i go back through and reread what i highlight and pull out the pre the the creme the lacrim of the information another small thing if you're reading a book with lots of characters write down the characters and kind of like give them a description so you can refer back to them when they show back up again because sometimes i'll lose track of characters if it's a complex book and you just don't you just don't know um so that's what i do i read slowly i actually it's horrible i wish i read faster i read at the speed that i talk just about i read a little bit faster but it's just about the speed that i talk and i read every single word i want to i will say this when i do read a book slowly and like i do read i remember a lot from the book which is cool but read it slowly highlight it take notes there you go mix next question what was planned be if you rang the bell um there was no i wasn't gonna ring the bell wasn't gonna happen it's seriously wasn't gonna happen and but well here's what could happen injury you can get injured in butts yeah and some injuries are more preventative like shin splints if you train properly before hand you probably won't get shin splints but if you're doing rock porridge and you there's big waves and you're bringing a boat a zodiac boat or a ibs boat up the rocks in big waves you can just get your knee broke like you can happen so then what would happen if i would have gotten out of you don't go on to the fleet healed up come back so i would have done you know try again it's uh that's one of the scariest things about butts from a guy that like the guys that i know that were like yeah we're never gonna quit but they there's a possibility you're gonna get injured yeah can you get rolled they call it rolled yeah you get rolled back what but it like even if you get sick right like a doctor can be like hey you can't continue yep that can happen that can happen to guys in hell week they'll get pneumonia and they're just they can't like they're they're not quitting but they're coughing up blood they're speeding blood out of their mouth and they're like and the doctors like hey are you okay but i'm fine yeah and so they just have to they just have to get rolled back yeah it happens there's very few people that don't get rolled back oh yeah it's pretty small number that don't get rolled back at all really yeah like for medical medical failure if you fail something you get rolled back you fail a run i forget i don't know what is right now when i went through if you failed to run okay you got to write up if you failed another run you got rolled back see good to do the whole thing again you gotta do the whole thing yeah not just the run you gotta do everything again yeah yeah yeah oh thing oh it's a night so i failed a run us swim a obstacle course like and then you just freaked out i was so okay i think you could actually when i went through you could fail one per phase so there was three phases first phase second phase and third phase you could fail like one of each thing per phase which is with sounds really lenient but dang you're doing because you're doing a time run every week and a time run every week and then you're doing a million they just call a conditioning runs which is the most understated name for run ever because what they really were is just the most grueling as fast as you could go through the soft sand runs like for how long for air mouth no no no no no no and not only that you ran to you ran to breakfast and back then you ran to lunch and back and you ran to dinner and back and each one of those runs was one mile so there's six miles before you ran anywhere before you conditioning run and your time run you're doing a six mile run every day just that's awesome that is like that's not a sprint sometimes you have to run fast sometimes you run slow but it's just like a lot of times just the little you know typical military shuffle yeah so yeah no man. Question what actual strategy should a jiu jitsu white belt employ during a roll other than relax tap early tap off and etc. Well those are the key points but the other thing is I would say try and do moves that you've actually learned instead of instead of doing something that you that you just like you're spashing out trying to do some random thing you actually do something that you know and if you get in a situation that you don't know what to do remember the situation you were in since you can ask an instructor hey here's where I was I didn't know what do you can you please help me yeah simple pretty straightforward yeah next question if a coworker were attempting to bully intimidate or make you generally miserable do you go with it would you make a mention of your jitsu knowledge or keep it a surprise I like that question oh yeah I would keep it I'm I keep everything a surprise right I just keep everything a surprise because I'm not here like hey you know I do jitsu you better back off you know like what is that and then said you're just like hey man all good you know and then let that guy find out for himself that you know the hard one yeah either the hard way or someone will be like hey man you know that guy that you keep messing with like I train jitsu every day he's gonna choke you up put you to sleep and then guess what he's gonna do he's gonna be a mouthy because he's already been he's already been testing you and he's like oh he's kind of a whim so yeah I mean there's no like is there even a cool way you can say I train jitsu no because even if you pull it off externally like internally you're like you know who said it cool John Cloud Vendam hoiler Gracie hoiler Gracie did it was surfing and I think kid Belegro told me this story but it might have been hoiler that told me this he was surfing and somebody wanted to know give him some beef get nuts if you wanted somebody wanted it like you know hey what are you doing out here times thing and he was like you know he did what I would do it see you know you just kept surfing kind and then the person started talking more and then he started running his mouth and then hoiler said something like um hey you like to surf I like to fight if you want to fight we can do that and I thought that was a pretty cool way to say it he told that story I think I was unless he told another time to you at Bryan Sargent's promotion to Blackbelt oh you were I think kid Belegro was here too I forget but yes he told me that story to like the group he told it to me and I thought you were there right yeah he was yeah I thought there was like kind of more actually he said it's cooler than that he said it cooler than that he said it some way that was like yeah listen you like to fight you like to surf for your life I fight for my life yeah you you surf for a living I fight for a living it was something even more than what I said but it was good yeah we can fight it kind of you can surf yeah it was a kind of thing where you're like if you were that guy you think you know you know yeah maybe I'll not do this whole thing right now I remember thinking the same thing is you like dank those are really dope what it's saying you know plus like you know that that guy obviously he didn't know who that was I'm assuming which would be kind of crazy if he didn't or if he did know who he was but and then what if hypothetically later he found out like who that was and he'd like occasionally I've had people say things like like they kind of know who should I say like oh you know let's go you know something like that yeah and it's like yeah yeah I mean cool that's always mine that's awesome yeah cool like you want to go now and then there was like oh no no no just kidding all right next question what do you typically wear when you meet the bosses of companies and why oh uh they meant if you're working with Ashland front then pretty much what we all wear is the the EF pillow the Ashland front uh pillow shirt and you know we we we called the what we wear business tactical yeah just pillow shirt and pair of pants and what the question is why well that's just because it's uh it to me it's the same kind of thing I've been talking about just sort of a normal thing to wear right um don't really travel as much as I travel as little as possible I came with a full suit and yeah so just comfort and functionality yeah there's the answer yeah and of course you'll show up in your shorts yeah no no we're a professional and rascar yeah the remember you used to wear suit right like back in the yeah I mean and I still wear well wear a suit sometimes but usually not man usually not you know even um usually people people know who we are now yeah and so if we're gonna show up they realize what they're getting which is like hey these guys are these guys are gonna comment and talk to us and they they know what the deal is yeah there's all the footage of us on on the videos and stuff where we're in kind of the EF uniform so business tactical get some all right next question and I guess there is a there is a a small bit of like hey we're not we're not standard business people you know in a man yeah that makes it it's like hey like you're in a room with people with a bunch of suits on and they're like oh who's presenting oh it's that guy over there because he's wearing something different okay we get it you know in a man yeah just a little identifier echelon front on the shirt oh good how do you grow better faster stronger with your romantic partner over time without being a brute I just I don't even I just kind of had to put this question in here because it was I don't really understand I mean just because you're bigger and faster and stronger doesn't mean you're a brute right what what is that I don't how do you overcome that be nice to your you know your girlfriend whoa you know wife um what's the your romantic partner like what does that mean no like with if you're working out with your romantic partner or like you're getting bigger and faster and stronger and therefore you start treating your girlfriend like crap like no it's like no it actually you'll probably be nicer because you're bigger and faster and stronger so it's kind of a non-question I guess but I just thought it was funny because you think you think I'm gonna do squats today then I'm just gonna go beyond the normal man being a brute look the being a brute that part I can see that you know because you know like let's say like you gained 20 pounds 30 pounds it's just and it's like all muscle you're super strong now you know and you know you come home you're just more of a like the stuff that you do you know you're vacuuming you know like you're just way more broodish you are yes so I don't know vacuum harder you're vacuuming with more finesse you got to focus on the finesse part of it otherwise you're gonna be all big fast and strong the the and I I think I understand a question but here's the here's the tip that I'm been married forever but significantly long here's what I found out like a lot of stuff like as a guy you think like hey I'm not really gonna do that because like that's not important you know like you you have a set of things that you think are important and they're based on certain ways of thinking then the girls gonna have things she thinks is important and in my experience which I from what I understand is very common that the things that some girls think are important they can't really put their finger on it or why they feel important or whatever but they just do you know and the guy will be like hey that's an important you can't even explain why it's important therefore you know I win the whole importance significance argument right so at the end of the day they're not gonna do these things just little things you know show me that you care like these sensitive things things that go against being faster stronger more British but if you can keep in mind that little little things even if you don't think they're significant actually do make your romantic partner happy and if you can consistently maintain that regardless of how big fast or strong you get that will help he's gonna embrace your big bigness fastness and strongness take it from the end no cool next question in cooperation and negotiation is there a tell to know when you're breaking your personal code and compromising too much is it a gut check or is it gut check or logical this is a weird one there's a kind of a confusing question so I just kind of kind of answer it to the best of my ability well the the biggest thing I notice when I'm when I'm interacting with other people the biggest thing that I pay attention to is am I paying it am do I care about this particular thing because of me or because of it's gonna help the team and if you can get through that if you if you really just say to yourself hey am I doing this because I'm gonna help the team or am I doing this because it's good about me if you pay attention to those things I'm not saying that every time that you say hey you know what I need to take care of me a little bit because you you have to remember that you have your strategic goals too right but most of the time the success of the team is gonna help you strategic goals now so for me I'm my constant thing is hey why am I why why does this concern me does it concern me it's basically does this concern me because my ego or not and if it doesn't concern me because my ego then it concerns me because it's not gonna benefit the team so let's help the team so that's that's what I that's what I look at the most when I'm negotiating when I'm cooperating you know if if you and I were negotiating a deal right and I was gonna buy a car from you and I was like you know you want to sell it for me to for 10 grand and I want to get it for nine how much of it and you're like okay you know what jaco I got it on the lot for for 8800 can you give me $400 over the what I paid for it and give me 9200 or whatever and I'm like no how much of that is me just this is my ego I just want to mean the ego fight against you and how much of it is me like hey that's actually a pretty good deal and and why not take care of this guy because I don't know I don't really know you but hey man maybe we'll buy something else in the future maybe all you'll have you know what I mean so am I trying is is it my ego or is it just a bad deal if you're like hey nope it's 11000 and I'm like okay you know what I'm not gonna pay that so it's not it's not my ego that's just not a good deal at 10 grand it's not a great deal at 9200 it's a pretty damn good deal for me and it's you're gonna make some money and I'm happy that you're gonna make some money cool you know what let's say can so let's make a deal there's times where this is the so this is the point there's times where my ego I'll be like no I don't care I don't care if you're only gonna make 200 bucks that's that's your problem you should have paid so much when in my heart I know like hey that's actually a good deal I'm getting a really good deal but my ego is not letting me have closed close it that can be a fact that can be a problem so when I'm negotiating with someone and it's not a good deal they're not gonna get me to do what they want me to do it's just not gonna happen if it's a fair deal hey we'll make it work it's not a fair deal it's gonna be problematic you don't want to present me with unfair deals because I will not be accepting them also does it seem like this moral question I guess you you kind of got to like be truthful to yourself like consciously too right because when you could you give it like how you say you gotta ask yourself is this is this good for me and my ego or is this good for the team like as far as me not compromising my you know who not compromising or my personal code or whatever yeah and there's values that I will not compromise right there's a values that I will not compromise would that I would think that that before a very specific reason you know you know how for some people they'll be like I'm just not like that but they don't really know why like hey well I don't know maybe because my dad told me that one time when we're fishing or whatever the so there's a difference is what I'm saying so but here's the thing and I say this this is what I'll do sometime I'll be like hey you know this is more important because of you know I don't know my hell oh you're rationalized yeah you know and yeah I'll essentially like twist the truth to myself to to kind of explain to myself again how important this is you know for the team you know one of the things if that's important there's other ways to do that so so to to your point that's what I'm saying when I'm thinking about decisions I'm asking myself hey is this my ego or is this oh my doing the right thing for the rope for the team yeah because there's that's what you should be checking on right if you're doing it for yourself most 99% of the time if you're doing something for yourself that hurts the team the long term is not going to be beneficial to you okay the long term is not going to be beneficial to you because you're doing something for yourself everybody sees that you don't think they see it but they see it yeah so you try and do things that are going to benefit the team and sometimes I'm 99% of the time when you do something that benefits the team you're going to benefit from it as well but you have to see the long game because sometimes the short game it's like oh no if I do this for the team that means I'm going to miss this this weekend and that sucks well guess what in the long term when you work this weekend and cover for the other guys it couldn't make it in for whatever reason you're going to have a better relationship with them and they're going to cover for you next time it's like it's long term it's going to be good yeah but you're worried about you and that's that's a problem playing the long game again yeah always gotta play that long game next question that's way to get your team get you team in okay best way to get your team to buy in to your vision let it be their vision let the vision come from them right and the more the vision comes from them the more the plan comes from them the more they buy into it the more you force the vision and force the plan down there's throw the less buy in that you're going to get from it now you if you're super persuasive you can do a better job of coming up with a vision but why do that why not say hey guys you know what we're going to put together the direction that this team is going give me some feedback give me some bullet points hit me now they all come back with bullet points you as someone together it's okay this is what we're going to do it boom everyone's on board that easy our plan yeah so much easier with our plan and you if you're scared of that and I think if all if I give the team the opportunity come up with a plan they're going to come up with a plan that sucks well how well did you train them if they come up with a plan that sucks you haven't trained them very well most of the time if you train them decently they're going to come up with a plan that's close enough to the decent plan that they can go and execute you we can all execute it together that can be part of the vision let's go hey juggle what would be better verbal communication with concept of prioritizing ex-y when talking to my wife she oftentimes feels overwhelmed with how many decisions she has to make she hates when I use the words of prioritizing ex-y cute well the root problem there isn't that she hates the the words prioritize next you the the problem is is that you're you're telling her what to do yes that's you know instead of being like hey you know hey if you just prioritize next you there's if there's a at least a 50% chance that she doesn't even want to hear your suggestion she's just telling you because it's vent she's venting to you so for you to be like man those are a lot of decisions make that's hard if you were to say to her how do you how do you handle this because I know you're doing this every day girl I'm impressed how do you do that and then she says well you know it's hard but here's what I do so if it was just a matter of re-naming it it's like hey well call it hey you know what you need to do is grade and go or what you what you need to do is rank and roll what you need to do is triage and check off what you need to do or or designate and do that's you know there's a bunch of different ways you could phrase it but that's not what's making her responded in a negative way it's responding in a negative way because you're saying hey here's all you need to do is prioritize next you right that's a snow what she needs is some sympathy some listening allowing to vent and then you can say hey you know if you've done that properly you can say well you know I did read that book and they kind of say when there's a bunch of crazy things going on like you've got going on they say to do the same thing that I see you do which is you pick the most important one and then you kind of focus on that that's pretty cool you do that pretty well yeah you do that really well so just take a little bit of approach man yeah it's not just the words the words are not important I hate to break the news to you but the words are not pissing her off you are listen to her it seems you don't notice some people they come you and a problem they don't want a solution oh yeah it happens all the time they just want you to sit there and listen to them yeah my wife does that for sure for sure you know hey there's this problem oh why don't you do this it's not that easy okay fine yeah you just tell me more about the problem I'm still here listen don't say that by the way you're going to do that that part yeah yeah yeah yeah it's almost like when it is like it seems like they yeah that they don't mind so much the suffering of the problem suffering I'm over using that word I know but like they don't mind the suffering they just want to they don't want to suffer alone so if like oh yeah I'm having like these issues or whatever first is like hey come suffer with me sympathize empathize or whatever we can suffer together that that's that's why I'm coming to you in the first place so I can get closer to you whatever whatever I don't know that I'm totally reflecting diminished do you remember when I talked about that yes that's like a such a good tactic in this situation reflect the emotions back to them but diminish them a little bit so if they're all freaking mad about something you go oh I can't believe that but you don't be as mad as them but you don't be the hate calm down you don't you don't say yeah hey here's just just prioritize next cue oh it's a rough one actually to be honest like I felt that before where I'd come to my brothers typically the one like I've come to him with like a problem and here's the thing I didn't want like sympathy or empathy primarily but I wanted a little bit you know so you can't just roll sit there with your apple or whatever okay I think what you're gonna do is put this you know like kind of like you're so done it you get this feeling I'm not saying this you want to know why your brother or you or whoever can look at that problem and like come up with a solution it's because they're detached they're de facto detached from the problem so when you're all wrapped up in the problem you're like a head or no way to do because I got this this and this your brother's like well just do that and you're like you get mad you know well you're able to see what to do because he's on the outside yeah so if you can learn to too detach yourself you won't have to rely on getting other people to help you yeah if you can't detach and you're all wrapped up in the emotions the situation you're gonna you're gonna have to go someone to help and then when you do don't get mad at them when they just tell you the solution but but when you reverse the rules and you take ownership of trying to provide solutions you got to realize that it's your fault that your solution isn't being welcomed yeah and that's kind of the point where like I'm trying to gain an understanding you know because easy when your detachments first in his like why are you complaining about like because this is like you feel the front of your mind you're like why are you complaining about this why don't you just solve that problem and never complain about it ever again you know that's the feeling the other person have that detached person the you know in this case um the husband and whatever so what I did was I imagine my situation that I'm on the other side where I kind of like I know what it feels like to kind of want some sympathy I don't want sympathy and that's it you know but of course but I want some of it so imagine that feeling then or I imagine that feeling that I got from my brother at times when I come to him with a problem that that's bothering me or whatever and the part and the fact that it's bothering me means nothing all my end so the fact that the way he presents a solution with no empathy and sympathy almost says actually it feels like it says you're so dumb like you're dumb yeah you know like why you wrapped up about this thing you're dumb kind of thing so from a leadership perspective from his perspective he's your recognized that what he needs to do is massage your ears feel good about it be like oh man that's a hell of a problem you know one thing maybe you could do I don't know if you'd be up I don't know if I could do it but you could probably do it because you're a little bit better at this kind of thing you just don't just do that well that's a good tactic right there when you say like like what you what you kind of do kind of like you're like one of these individuals one of the rare people who knows how to deal with it and it's like with all right you know nothing that you do that I can't really do it though is you prioritize and that's it what you think of you I just get all scattered brain so focus on all kinds of different things at the same time and that's a problem yeah there you go get some next question my warrior kids want to know is where your kid number three in the works yes warrior kid three is in the works I am on chapter 10 yeah and but unfortunately I've been on chapter 10 for a couple days not because it's taking me a long time to write chapter 10 but I didn't write yesterday or the day before because we were doing multiple podcasts which is a bummer but be back on the path today as a matter of fact well technically you're on the path your path is just super wide you know you had to switch lanes for a little bit you know miss you miss it exit but good you know boom you're back on on in that lane on the same path so yeah and we're looking at we're looking at spring publication for that once again getting it out there really haven't found right in this book that's the characters develop more complex some complex there's some complexities there's some situations that mark hasn't really had to deal with yet the primary being Danny Reinhart so brace yourself for the impact of Danny Reinhart brace yourself all right that's what you're life's hell is intense and intentional how do I even get started living like that let's just break this down real easy okay number one if you want to live like more focused in your life choose to decide that you're going to actually live like that do that right down whatever it is you want to do and then before you go to bed at night right down some things that you're gonna do tomorrow they're gonna help you move towards the goals that you have and then set your alarm clock for early in the morning wake up and do the things that you wrote down stay on that path that's it yeah and do you think that you've just sort of grown accustomed to just dealing with it that way so you know the more you do it yeah absolutely so that's kind of the hard part right to get off the ground should be saying to break the gravitational pull of laziness and apathy yes yeah and of course that but I feel like that in this kind of situation like when you live how intently intense sure but you kind of always being intense but that intentional situation because it's pretty easy if you know a goal it's pretty I don't say easy but it's simple like to reach that goal is really clear you know like you're gonna have to fight through obstacles all this other stuff but if you don't really have an intentional like goal it's hard to just kind of float there and be like I need to be I don't know vaguely success what's like it's it makes the whole deal harder and it's a lot of times like a normal person would they don't have specific goals for every aspect of their life you know they'll have one in maybe with their career something like that or fitness or something like that but everything else is just sort of hey I'm leaving day by day doing the best I can't kind of think but if you can whether be right it down or whatever if you can have it in your brain consciously that or remember essentially like what these goals are it makes it a lot more clear and then the more you kind of follow those goals the more it becomes like habit like you just what I think check next question how do the finest civilian leaders differ from the finest military leaders or in other words what character traits do military leaders develop that are more difficult or rare for civilian leaders to develop there really the leadership is leadership and the good civilian leaders have the same good qualities that the good military leaders have and vice versa and life life was talking about this the other day that you know he he tells people like hey man I wish you were in the military wish you you would have been good you know you would have been a good infantry officer you would be good sealed platoon leader that would have been cool if you were in teams because you're a good leader in the civilians after you're a good leader in the you'd be a good leader in the military so there's no and now there are strengths and weaknesses for leaders in both of those situations in military leaders you take 10 military leaders there's all kinds of strength and weaknesses different between all each one of those 10 and there's all kinds of you take 10 civilian leaders and all kinds of different strengths and weaknesses amongst those 10 and if you put them if you flip them back and forth it doesn't matter there's still going to be random strengths and weaknesses some guys are good at presenting things some guys are good at simplifying things some guys are good at articulating things and and those groups washed out regardless there's great military leaders that aren't very articulate but they figure out who to get done there's great civilian leaders that aren't very articulate but they figure out what there's great military leaders that are really good at simplifying things there's great civilian leaders that are good at simplethere's people that are not good at that so they find the correct solution the people that'll compliment them as leaders and move forward But no huge difference. Actually, there's no difference. There's just, there's good leadership and there's bad leadership. That's it. Hey, Jockel, love your book, Sam Podcast. When it comes down to the wire, and you need to make a quick and tactical decision and admit, amidst chaos, how do you keep your head straight? This is just everyone knows the answer to this by now, detach. Take a step back, take a step back offline, take a step back from the tactical situation and turn your head, look around, see what's going on, assess it properly, unemotionally, and then make a decision. That's it. You gotta learn to detach. Easy money. Next question. Jockel, it's not easy. It was easy. People would ask me that question. Two months ago, it's a simple, not easy. It is simple, it is simple, but it's definitely not easy. No, it's not, and I'll tell you, it's not only not easy, it's almost so hard that you don't even see it happening. It's like you're blind to it. Most people are blind to it. That's why it's such a huge advantage from a leadership perspective. You can be one inch above everyone else. You can see infinitely further than they can, because let's face it. They have a limited, when you're at one level, when you're at six feet, you can see what you can see. You go to eight feet, you can see things that they can't see. They literally can't see them. So therefore, you know things that they don't know. And all of a sudden, you seem brilliant, because you can literally see things that they literally can't see. So take a step back, turn your head, look around, detach from your emotions, detach from the chaos, that's it. And the emotions, that's like one of the major things that's making you blind. The first one? Yeah, whether it's emotions, whether it's anger, whether it's frustration, whether it's panic, whether it's stress, all those emotions will have the same result on you and your decision making, which is you won't see what's actually happening. Jalko, how do you build a relationship with a boss that consistently loses his temper on a regular basis? Stay calm, don't overreact, let them vent to you. And don't make a big deal out of them losing their temper. Just be like, just absorb it and be like, hey, it's all good boss, let them vent. And then when they calm down a little bit, just don't even go like, man, I'm glad you calm down. No, just be like, you know, say, okay, hey, here's where we're at with this decision. I'm gonna bring this to the troops or whatever, just be calm. And then eventually, hopefully, you get a relationship that's strong enough so you can actually say something to them, like, hey, man, you know, I know you, I know things drive you crazy, but, you know, it's always a lot better when you're just kind of calm. And everyone kind of has a lot of respect for that, you know? But again, that's when you gotta be careful with because they might just go, what are you talking about? You don't know about respect, they might have to say. They might have to say, right there. So yeah, I'm just gonna be calm, not overreact, absorb that kind of thing. Next question. I'm struggling to be an effective leader because I'm told that I don't have the right tone. I'm too direct in course. And I'm not too sure how to fix it. I'd appreciate any of it. And all help, thanks a lot. If you can record yourself while you're talking to people, like when you're on the phone with someone, just record to take out your cell phone and record and see what you sound like. Because you might be surprised at what you sound like. A lot of times people don't realize what they sound like. You might have to overcompensate for a little while and be overly pleasant and nice to people, which to them might sound like normal, but to you, it'll sound like you're being just totally over the top nice because you're like, how are you today? And they're thinking, oh, that's nice. These actually have an accommodation with me. And in your mind, you're like, these are just pleasant trees. I don't think I should be, you know, it's like, no, just calm down. It's actually great feedback. It's awesome that people have actually told you that you are too direct and too course. So what does that mean? You're offending people. If you're offending people, do they listen to you? The answer is no. So how do you not offend people? And in your mind, you're thinking, hey, this is the way I am. You know, I'll just want to these people that's direct. You don't, you know, I just put the word out. And it's like, no, actually all you do is piss people off offend them and now they don't listen to you. So don't be that person. Let's try and build relationships. Make that your key goal, make your goal, not to get the your point across to them, but to build a relationship with them. Make that your goal. And then the rest of it will start to come together. Get you moving in the right direction. Yeah. And sometimes, do not say this person is like this, but sometimes people who are direct and course like they sort of take pride in it, and also, so if you can search your mind and be like, hey, am I taking pride in this a little bit? Know that you're going full speed in the wrong direction. That's right. With that, you know, if that's the case, that makes you a lot easier. Here you go. Yep. Affirmative. Next question. I serve in the Coast Guard and operate in high risk surface operations where not only do I have victims in the water who gave a high risk, who have a high risk of dying, but also my people and myself have a high probabilities of being injured or killed. I enjoy my job thoroughly and perform on the job, but it's the waiting that's brutal. How do you manage stress, it stress in the off time. So it's not overwhelming. Look, you've got a train hard, you've got to be prepared, you've got to rehearse, you've got to drill worst case scenarios, you've got to be an awesome physical condition, you've got to do all those things. You prepare as much as you can. You can't worry about things that you can't control. So the things that you can't control, what can you control? You can be in good physical shape, you can prepare for your equipment, make sure you know how to operate your equipment, you can drill worst case scenarios, so make sure your team understands the procedures that you're supposed to do. So you take control of all the things that you can control, you do those to the end degree, the things that you can't control, you just gotta not worry about them because that's what's, you're actually less prepared because you're worrying about other things. You can't sleep because there's a storm coming and you know that there's gonna be some rescues. It's like, hey, you've prepared, you've trained, you've got your equipment already, you've rehearsed with your teammates, like that's what we do. And there's some things that I can't control, and I'm okay with that. And not to get too crazy, but like worst case scenario, and not to get too like dark worst case scenario, what happens? Worst case scenario, what happens? You die. That's the worst case scenario that happens. Okay. Okay, so you've got your insurance taken care of, you've got your SGLI set up, you've written letters to your family to tell them what to do, and that you've had a great job and that you loved what you're doing, what you're doing, and that's the way it goes. You know, part of life is death, 100%. Think about that, 100%. So if you can compartmentalize the things that you can control and say, okay, these are things I've got control of, and then you look at the worst case scenario, which is the worst case scenario, I mean, I guess the worst case scenario is like, hey, if you could one of your teammates, you know, dies, that seems to me to always be the worst thing, or you die. What are you gonna do? So to prevent my teammate from dying, I'm gonna train, prepare, do everything I can to my power, and one of the things in my power to do is to not be scared of things that I can't control, or not worry about things that I can't control. And then like, hey, I could die doing this job. That could happen. What do you do about that? You prepare for it. You write your will, you make sure that, your W, your W2, or page two, I believe it's called your page two, and the military service records, so that they know what to do with your finances. You fill out your SGLI form, you write a letter to your friends and family. That's what you do. And then you go out and you do your job. The fear, the fear of death that you have in your mind is more likely to cause a problem. If you're afraid of death, you're more likely to die, than if you say, you know what, if this happens, God forbid, guess what? I'm living the life I wanna live, and I'm gonna die doing this. It's like that, if you can get over that hurdle right there, that's a huge thing. And the more comfortable you are with that, the less chance of you actually dying, there is because you won't be scared of it. You won't be hesitant, you won't be paranoid, you won't lose sleep, you'll be like, okay. So just truly think about it. Like, man, you're doing an important job, you're gonna try and save people's lives, there's inherent risk in that, but it's what you wanna do, is what you chose to do, there's, you deal with that. And if you can get through that, that's a huge step. Does this mean you wanna die? No, it doesn't mean that at all. It doesn't mean that at all. It doesn't mean that at all. But if you're like, you know what, I could die. That's one of the possible outcomes here. It's highly unlikely, but it is a possible outcome. If it happens, I've lived the best possible way I can. I've prepared for my family, friends, to be taken care of to understand what happened, and I'm okay with that. That's my recommendation. Makes sense. Jocca, I'm very goal oriented. I'm very goal oriented. My friends say that they want me to achieve this and that yet they still are vaping, parting, being lazy and overall don't walk the talk. I wanna be an AF special tactics. Air Force. Air Force special tactics officer, and I don't have time for those destruction. How do I get to Monttrak? Well, this is pretty straightforward one for me. What I do is I walk the walk and keep walking. And if these guys want to walk the walk with me, cool. But if they want to vape and party and be lazy, those aren't the kind of guys you want around with your team anyways. So unless they get on the path that leads to the right place, I mean, you can tell them, hey man, this isn't gonna get you there, but don't spend a bunch of time trying to pick up and drag people that don't wanna drag themselves. Not that you go into an organization like a special tactics in the Air Force. You don't wanna be caring other people. You don't have to motivate other people. You want people that wanna do the job themselves. So don't spend a bunch of time with these people that don't wanna get after it. Makes sense. Jockel, when things start moving fast and feel out of control because you're really getting after it. Work, family, duty to encounter this other things. How do you slow it down and get the feeling back of being in control? What you do in this situation is go harder. You go harder. What you do is, and this is, think of it like this. Think of it as a sprint. You get in bogged down, there's a bunch of stuff going on. Grab a hold of a bunch of them and sprint and get caught up. That's what you do. You sprint, you get caught up. I do that kind of right now. And I didn't start doing that. I really started having to do these little sprints that I do sometimes now. Like maybe a year ago. Where I just have to just buckle down for three days and do nothing but work. Just that's it. Nothing but work. I mean, the middle of one right now, just what I did over the last few days is like, like, work, work and more work. So it's a sprint. But then you get caught up, you get things under control. And then you can go back to a more sustainable pace because you can't sprint forever. Mm. You cannot sprint forever, factually, right? That doesn't work. So if you think you're going to run along side of vehicle because you can sprint, that's not going to work. Eventually the vehicle's going to outpace you and you're going to be left behind. So you have to choose a race that you can win. But sometimes, just like in a running race, you've got a sprint to get ahead. And then once you get ahead, you can, you know, you can fall, you can go back to a sustainable pace. But that's, that's what I do. I go into like a little period of mass production. I prefer slow and steady. Absolutely. I prefer just to keep on the disciplined path every day doing what needs to be done. You know, that we talked about plant and a tree earlier. Like writing a book, nothing feels better, writing a book than when you look up after a month of writing and you got 30,000 words. Because you go to 1,000 words a day. To sit down and write 30,000 words is a gut chest. It's a gut check. For me, it is. Because I don't enjoy doing that for long periods of time. I don't enjoy sitting there typing because the boards are already pretty much in my head. So it's just a manual labor. But it's not manual labor where you get to move rocks. It's a manual labor of pecking into a keyboard. That's not fun for me. There's no, there's zero physical benefit. But to look up after a month and say, I got 30,000 words. That's almost a book, right? So I prefer to do that. But sometimes because I've saddleed myself with many different things going on right now, sometimes I get behind and I have to sprint. I have to just say, okay, you know what? This is gonna suck for three days, but I'm gonna get back on track. And here we go. So that's what I do. When I start feeling like all the things are kind of getting hang of me, like, hey man, maybe you have to, for work, you have to sacrifice your jitsu for whatever, two days. You're like, yep, I'm not gonna train. But that's gonna save me a total of five hours in the next couple days and I can get a lot of work done in five hours. I didn't do jitsu yesterday. Did I want to? Yes, I did. But I said, okay, I'm gonna sprint right now. I gotta get this other stuff done and I had to prioritize. So that's what you have to do. And guess what, you know, then you could through that sprint, I can go back to your sustainable thing, which is jitsu every day. Just work out every day, which is, you know, write your right every day, do your work every day. So try that, try just buckling out, tell your family, tell your jitsu instructor, be like, hey, listen, I'm gonna be gone for three days. I gotta get caught up. So stand by. And boom, tell your family, look, hey, I'm sorry for the next three days. You're not gonna hear much from me. As I always stay at work late, I'm gonna get a bunch of stuff done and just sprint hard and give them a little reward at the end. Hey, when I get back on Tuesday or when I get back on the Friday, we're gonna go out for dinner, we're gonna have a good time. But I gotta sprint, gotta get caught up. So there you go. That's the much of procedure. Good little tactic. Yeah, it is a good tactic. Oh, little reward, do you like that? Well, the whole deal, both of them like basically to make sure that you communicate with all these people that might be affected by your thing. Even like in small ways, like I say, hey, I'm gonna sprint right now, you'd be, oh, I'm sometimes surprised and how that just that little thing is so effective. Like, you know, I don't know, I'm gonna go to Jesus too. At, you know, a weird different time that may be my family sort of depending on me, not in a big way, but just a little bit depending on me being there. And I'm gonna go to Jesus instead. If I say, one week before I do that, I have to say, hey, on this day, you know, like, I understand, hey, usually I'm here, I dig it, but I'm gonna go this day, this training just kind of means a lot to me this day and time, whatever. A week before. Heads up, they love it. Love night and day. Try do it the hour before versus the week before night and day. One situation is like, yes, oh, we got your back. We'll do it. And the other one is like, yeah, distinct. Guess what my wife thinks. She thinks I'm going to do it to every day and I am. Yeah, but just like so. I'm just trying to surprise him to her. If I'm ever like, oh, you know, she'll be like, oh, what? You didn't leave yet? Yeah, I'm like, no, I'm actually working. She'll be like, oh, okay, that's what she realized. I got some work to do. Man, that's a good, that's good. To remember it, you know, because you, it's easy to get caught up in like, hey, this is me and my sprint. I'm the one gonna have to buckle down, you know, sort of thing. So it kind of maybe gets in the way of you thinking, like, hey, it's for other people too, you know, I'm saying, and then that, that additional one words, like, yeah, when I'm done, you got another reward. Cause then if you communicate, they don't need the reward. I mean, you know, depends on who it is, but typically it would, it would make sense for them not to need the reward because we're all good. Good words scenario. You think, don't do it too much. They expect it. But that's a good to, I think. That's good. I'm gonna put down into rotation. Next question, hey, Jocco, a lot of respect for you in your work. I have a question. How do you draw the line between doing things you're uncomfortable with to develop and just torturing yourself unnecessarily? It's pretty straightforward question, actually. And a pretty straightforward answer. Does it benefit you or not? Does it benefit you? And there is some level of torture that benefits you because it just keeps you mentally and physically tougher. So there is benefit to some level of torture, right? There's also a level of torture that is not beneficial for you actually it takes you backwards. And it's gonna injure you, it's gonna break you down. It's gonna break you down mentally, it's gonna break you down physically. There's times, like I've talked about this, like there's times when I've gotten on a plane, where I get on a plane, this is when I know I'm just done training, which is I get on a plane and I, because normally on a plane, I can like really hammer out some work. I can get a podcast, I can read a book, I can just really go hard because there's no, I don't sign up for Wi-Fi on the planes, I just do work. And when I get on a plane and I'm just like, oh, I'm gonna watch him, I'm gonna go into this thing and watch, and remember the last time I did I watched Zoolander, which is a funny movie, but there's zero positive benefit to my humanity by watching Zoolander. But that's it. So I just like, okay, mentally, just need to damn break. You know? And same thing with physical, like there's times where you're physically, like there's times, this is an interesting one. When you're training, you get to, if I have an injury that's recovering, and let's say normally I do eight rounds, 10 rounds. When I have an injury that's recovering, I have to have the discipline to say, you know what, I'm only doing four rounds today, because when you get to the fifth, six round, I'm tired, I'm making mistakes, seven, day, through, now I'm actually gonna get injured again. So I wanna recover from the injury, so I take some, I have to have the discipline to say no. Because the lack of discipline says, I'm just gonna train more, I'm just gonna train harder. And sometimes you have to take a little little bit of a breather. And so if you're doing something, that's uncomfortable, but it's making you stronger, or smarter, or faster, yeah, that's good. If you're doing something that's uncomfortable, and it's not beneficial to you, then that's not smart to do, except for the occasional god check, which is how you're gonna suck. This is just gonna suck, and I'm gonna do it anyways. And that's fine. So, you're kinda different than people. The concept that you're talking about, I think, yeah, that's universal, which is good, like, you talk about, like, going on the plane, right? Even the way you're like, that has no good for humanity, you know, I know that was like a joking way, it's putting it, but the thing is that is good for you. And it's, what is, is it lander? Is it lander, whatever you watch, or something that's not work? Because it's like, you know, compared to a workout, Rob Jones does this a lot, he'll compare it to like lifting weights or workout. Which is good, I think, up near perfect analogy, the work you know, I think. It's essentially just your rest between sets. That's all it is. So if it's like, yeah, you don't get rest between sets. Oh, yeah, see how much weight you can lift in, probably not that much. But there's a difference between resting for like two minutes between your sets and then resting one day. Yeah, I agree. Sometimes though, sometimes you can say, oh, I need a rest, but you don't really do that. What I mean, yeah, you gotta be careful of that. Sometimes you gotta go, oh, this is just torture. So I don't wanna do it, but you really just being mentally weak. So you have to be aware. You have to do things that suck sometimes. Yeah, for sure. Some workouts just suck. Yeah. And they're awful. And they're torture, but they make you stronger. They make you better and they make you tougher. Yeah. So you do them. Yeah. So a perfect, and then if you want to do the workout, and analogy, where you're like, okay, so those two dichotomies, if you will. So it's like, okay, rest between sets, cool, I dig it. You do work, and then you rest between sets. That's the whole thing, right? Format. But you're like, okay, if I need two minutes of rest in between my sets for this specific workout for this specific outcome or results from the workout, then boom, that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna rest for two minutes. So there's difference between, in that case, there's a difference between resting two minutes and then resting 15 minutes. You don't need all that rest. Now you're just cruising. Now you're just avoiding the next set or putting it off or doing whatever. There's a difference. But on the other side, the more extreme the side of the spectrum, the workout can be like not two minutes rest. The workout, the whole workout could last two hours long. No rest between sets. That's the workout. But when the workout's done, you still gotta rest and recover from that workout. So just because you don't have a set amount of sets in your work day to day, still doesn't mean you need that rest between sets or the various rest between workouts. One thing that I got used to in the military and I see it in companies all the time, like I could work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, never stop and never get everything done. Yeah, that's something to think about. So then you have to save yourself, well, how productive am I gonna be and what's important and what's not important? And you gotta make sure that you get your right. If you take no rest, you won't be able to function properly. And for me, like I could write 24 hours a day and not write all the books I want to write. I could do Gigi Gigi 24 hours a day and not get as good as I want to get. I could work out 24 hours a day and not get as strong as I want to get. So you have to figure out how to balance all those different items together to figure out, like, okay, what is an acceptable level at each one of these components? Yeah, and it's gonna take kind of identifying the results that you want that are acceptable to you. So yeah, like a little witty called, there's the, like NASCAR, right? You're watching streets of thunder. I don't know, the long-time cruise. That is a NASCAR. There's something of thunder, days of thunder. Anyway, he's like racing and he's like, hey, you gotta do a pit stop. Everybody gotta do a pit stop. But it seems weird when you're like racing and you're like, hey, I'm ahead of everybody. I'm not gonna stop right now. I'm for word, you know, but, but, you know, your wheels are gonna fall off, right? So you gotta pit stop sometimes. Watch some Zulander, whatever. And then when you're done, you can be way more productive because those tires are new now. So they can fly around the track. Grip everything, seems same. Cooker. So that's part of the game. That's what I'm saying. Next question. How does the introduction you gave to Mike in the equipment room square with extreme ownership? No judgment, just trying to... Oh yeah, so Mike's a rally when Mike's really came into task in a bruiser because his other task had had some leadership issues and Mike was sort of the collateral damage in that whole thing. And so they moved him from that task in it which was task, unit Charlie, into task, unit bruiser. And when he came in, I brought him into the equipment room at Seal Team 3, which is where I would counsel my junior officers. Because there was the, there was construction going on. At Seal Team 3 at the time, there was no ceiling, so everyone could hear you in your office. And so I would go into this equipment room and brief guys if need be. And I just brought Mike's rally in there and I had a counseling letter for him to sign and it said there's no drama in task, unit bruiser. Don't bring any into it. And that's it. It was like really straightforward. I don't know, I'm not gonna ask him if he still has it. But I don't know why this person thinks that that doesn't square with the extreme ownership. This one as I'm concerned that is, I had a guy that was coming into a unit that had been together for seven or eight months, gone through work up and ready getting ready for deployment and I just had to take ownership of the fact that I had a guy that was showing up that I didn't know I did get feedback. I got feedback from multiple people, multiple sources. And my bro source was like, hey, Cernelly, he's fucking good to go. And I was like, okay, cool. So I knew he was good to go, but still, I wanted to set the expectation right for him so that he knew like, man, he might think that, that was his first task unit he was with. He might think this is the way it is. It's like, no, that's not the way it is. So for me, it was just, hey, we're just taking ownership. For me, it was, hey, I'm just gonna take ownership if this makes sure he knows what's going on. Make sure he understands the expectations. Make sure that we're not gonna have any drama in here because we don't have any drama. There's no drama. Like we have problems we solve. We don't backstab each other and tell on each other and stab each other in the back. No, we have a problem. We get together, we solve the problem. That's how it is. And so that's all. You don't know, I don't even think that's, I'm not even quite sure I'd have to get more details on this question to figure out why that didn't seem like the right thing to do for my perspective. It was, you know, it's great when you have somebody come on board and say, hey man, here's the expectations that are going on. Boom. Yeah, maybe because that was before he did anything. It's like he did something and then you were like, hey, you're bringing drama. Don't do that here. It wasn't that it was like, we don't have drama here. Don't bring it in here. Yeah. You know, with that? And Mike's really said, Roger that sir. Yeah, makes it. Yeah, of course. And you know how much drama you brought in? Zero. Yeah. So in a way, I mean, I don't know, looking at it from the outside. It seems like that was, you know, the essence of extreme ownership. You're using some anticipated problems. I'm going to do everything to mitigate whatever all these things. And I'm going to go a pre-empted problem solving mode tactfully. Yeah. And you're way, you know, the locker room. Yeah, I wasn't even like I was like, you better not. It didn't even accuse anything. You know, punty. I literally said there's no drama here. Yeah. Don't bring any. I didn't say like, you, we know, you know, I didn't get to point my finger. No. It was like, hey, man. Hey, cousin, my mind. I'm thinking, we know what I'm thinking of my mind. Hey, I got a prior and listed marine. That's going to be in my tasking it. I got another body. And he's an experienced guy. With, you know, yeah, I was totally stoked. Yeah, I was totally stoked, man. Yeah. So, no factor. No factor. All right. That's why I got time for one more, man. One more question. Sure. How do you stay on the war path when everything seems to be going wrong? Good question. You think that's a good question? Well, here's what I think is strange about that question. It's sort of like the question I had to answer about like sprinting. It's easy to, when things are going right, it's easy to stay on the war path. Right? You don't even need to be on the war path when things are going great. Because everything's happy. There's no war going on. You're at peace. People are delivering food to you. And you're getting a massage. There's no, you're not like, oh, I need to be on the war path right now. While I'm getting a back massage, while I'm getting food delivered to me. That's not happening. When the actual time that you need to go on the war path and you need to go harder on the war path is when things are going wrong, wrong. That's when you need to dig deeper. That's when you need to, that's when the whole idea of saying good. That's when it happens when things are actually when you're getting tested by the world. That's when you want to do it. So when you get tested by the world, that's when you get the opportunity to show the world what's your made of. That's when you get to say, bring it on. Bring it on. Oh, things are going wrong. Bring it on. I actually look forward to that. Because this is when I get to exercise my discipline. This is when I get to show the discipline. I get to put the discipline to work. It's the moment I have been waiting for. Because let's face it. If things were easy, then I could just sit around and slack off. Right? That's what happens. When things are easy, when things are going right, that's when you actually can slack off a little bit because things are going right. I don't recommend it. I recommend actually when things are going right, you go hard. But when things are going wrong, you need to go even harder. So if everything's going wrong, it doesn't matter to me because I'm on the path. I'm going to stay on the path on the war path. I'm going to get my situation rectified. Stat. Get some. All right. That's like two hours or something right now. So let's, I don't know, speaking of the war path. The path. Yes. Yes. How could we get people to, you know, how could we assist? With people being on the war step one, you do to that's in. That's right. Maybe that's step. Yeah, man, that's step one straight up. Made one make. Depends on where you are to begin. So let's face it. Anyway, so you need your, your key right. No need to ask anymore. Get an origin gate origin main.com 100%. 100% made in America. Yes, 100% good to get the gate and also 100% made in America. You made in America from the dirt to the githop straight up. Yeah, because it leads face it from the top soil to the githop. Top, so it tops little to the top of the githop. Yeah, fully. And for those who care about the aesthetics of the github, these aesthetics are, how should I say? Made specifically for you just to for sure. But I do do people. But you do do people? Yes. But they're like, they're cut. You know how they like, they're not like for G2. You can see them. And they look dope too. By the way, if you care about that, can stuff. Yeah, just a little bit. You want to make like you don't care. But you care. No, I am and always have been impressed by specifically dragon weave. Bigger. Come on. Yeah, I did. A dragon weave. You're not like a like, I still am impressed. It is. You know what I mean? Yeah. Have you seen the machine that they, that they figure out how to weave that thing? It's like a old. It's in pizza office. And it's like, it's, I'll have people to picture of it. But it's like, it looks like a mechanical thing from from 1898. I bet just from 1930. I bet you the thing is actually from 1930. Well, I have to ask Pete what year it is. But that's the actual thing. It's the old school thing that you figure out. You program is the work. But it's nothing. There's nothing digital about this. Program, what the fabric is going to look like from this machine. It's freaking, it's cool. Anyways, yeah. So that's a dragon weave. Also, rashguards. Also, 100% made in America. T-shirts, other things. Some cool stuff on that. Yeah. Supplements as well. Yeah. And supplements for your joints, a, for your being as a human. And for your operational capabilities. So join warfare for your joints, krill oil for your being, and joint. And joints, discipline for your operational capability. And lift your cognitive and your physical capabilities. And then, of course, we got that milk. So my additional protein for that. One. Had a big milkshake, put dark chocolate in it, by the way. You said that on the last podcast. Yeah, but you can put it in. Yes. And I put dark chocolate. Oh, dark chocolate. How outstanding. With what flavor, milk? Peanut butter chocolate. Is that your go-to? Currently it is. It was the main thing. It is for me too. Yeah. And it's all based on like how I feel. I'm just going to tell you, I probably have had peanut butter six times in a row, which it used to be not happening. It would be mint six times in a row. And then right now, I'm just so down with that peanut butter. Just down the foot. Yeah, on the peanut butter train. Situation. Yeah. But yeah. So these supplements overall, especially the joint ones, like, markets, it's like a kind of, just me alone with my thoughts. I'm like, this is kind of a glamorous one. The protein hell. Yeah, my muscles. Yeah. But the joint warfare, they don't get like the glamour. Here's what one of my buddies was telling me yesterday, one of my brethren, seals was using vanilla gorilla. And he's like, I'm putting it in everything. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Everything he makes is coffee. Yeah, yeah. I don't know. I don't know about tea, but his main thing was coffee. He's like, yeah. He's putting it in his coffee. Yeah. And he said it's like a sweetener. But obviously it's not bad for you. Yeah. It is sweetener because it makes a great thing. It makes a great thing. He was, you know when you talk to people and they get like the, the like, little, the little kid looking. Yeah. Yeah. He had that. I put the vanilla gorilla there. I could say he was getting fired up when he said he hit it with the blender. Yeah. So technically I do the same thing, but I put the coffee in. It's like a lower and a sprester, whatever, in the milk. Oh, yeah. So it's like a milkshake. It's like the same deal, but I'm sure the rest of the stuff. It's just a different thing. It's like coffee. It is. And that's the thing. So if you, like like coffee ice cream, you know, like that kind of stuff, where coffee ice cream and like black coffee, those are two different experiences for sure. Coffee ice cream, that's the delicious flavor when it's like delicious. So it's kind of the same deal with the milk. Speaking of delicious strawberry and chocolate or your kid milk for your children, I, this, this could get some kind of, you know, I'm not going to put myself in for a Nobel Peace Prize. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But like, hey, we are helping the children of the world in a big way with strawberry and chocolate, where your kid milk. Because there's no other thing that you're just as a kid, as a kid, you're about that little Snickers bar hitter, right? You know, with these bad snacks and the kids. Yeah, bad snack. Yeah, hitters, right? Sure. You right? Yes. And then you're going to have a fun on that one because he understands hitters better than me. But if you can give your kid a strawberry or chocolate, milk, hitter, they're just good to go. So stoked. And they're going to get stronger. Yeah. Literally. Help you. I told Pete, I said, on the warrior kid podcast that warrior kid milk will make you stronger. He's like, I don't know if you can legally make that claim. I'm like, well, it's already been said. Yeah. And it's straight up. How can you, how can you not, how can that not be legally made because does protein rebuild your muscles? Yes. Answer. Yes. Does warrior kid milk have protein in it? Yes. I guess we got to get the kids to jack steel, too. Or just grow up as a kid, healthy. Yeah, you'll get stronger as a kid growing up. You don't have to jack in East. So we are technically and legally authorized to say to the children of the world warrior kid milk will make you stronger. If I get the Nobel Prize for that, you get Nobel Prize for helping children around the world. Yes. Then I deserve it. Yeah. All right. There you go. And enough to go too deep into the whole thing about getting stronger. Like if you make the claim that something's going to make you stronger, I think that is fine, like legally because legally you can't like diagnose. It wasn't with it. There's certain there's a list of things you can do. You can't diagnose. You can't. Oh, treat. You know, they're specific kind of, they're more medically based. I think. But I don't know. Well, the only thing that we really, the only claim that we make, which is scientifically proven, is the deadlift capabilities. If you drink, drop a white TSA 1000 pounds. It doesn't sound. Which I mean, obviously, no one's going to argue with that. No. No. Because that's just facts. So if you want some of the, if you want some, jocco white T because you need a bigger deadlift, which you probably do, then you can get that from Amazon. Well, the cans from Amazon. The cans from Amazon. The key you can get to everywhere. Everywhere meaning online, just go online, man. Okay. Jocco white T. It's on the store. Okay. There you go. On what store? Jocco store. It's called Jocco store. And the website is joccostore.com. It's online. Did you see the website for origin? Or the doc. Yeah. Oh yeah, for all this, the jocco, uh, joint warfare, moalk, the geese, the rash guy, the origin stuff is all that origin main.com. I did say it, but, you know, that's a little reminder. Yeah. But, jocco white T is everywhere, including joccostore.com. Also on joccostore.com is where you can get your shirts when you're representing on the path. See, and that's a big part of being on the path. Actually, that's a good psychological and physical. Yeah. Experience. I don't know. You're going to say, but I know what you're going to say. What? It helps you stand the path. Well, you're not going to eat a donut while you're wearing a discount because we're eating T shirt. Exactly. That's, that's, it's physically impossible. I think so. Yes. You'll be like, you'll, you'll be like the exercise. You just won't be able to stop yourself from throwing the donut box in the garbage can. You know, it's weird and being serious. It's like now. Let me see. No. Like, I can't eat a donut. Even if I'm by myself, like, I can't. It's embedded already because it's like a thousand of the path. It prevents me physically from eating the donut. The only donut I could eat is one that is an actual piece of steak cut into a circle with a piece missing from the middle. Yeah. I might do that. Maybe. I might be like, here's my dough. I can steak donut just to get some. Well, here's the thing though. There's such thing as like little protein donuts. Yeah, but if you look at the ingredients. I don't know. What if it was like a paleo protein or help you when people make paleo stuff? It's like kind of solid. Okay, why not shape it like a stick? Yeah, I know. Really? I think you have a point of it. I'm putting it into a donut. Yes. This scenario. Because I think that's it. I think that's the thing. It's like the fact that it's a donut kind of is that's what kind of creates the little thing in my brain. Anyway, anyway, back to the storage aqua store. Who's on there? Shirts on there. Hats on there. A lot of cool stuff on there. You want to represent? If you're going to represent in the wild, jocostor.com, grab something. Keep your on the deaf core path. Also, okay, we talked about jocqu IT. Obviously, also you want to subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already. That'll kind of keep you in tune. So to speak, seems obvious, I guess, but it'll seem like a small thing. But hey, it's good to subscribe. Staying tuned, staying touch on iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play. Anywhere where you listen to your podcast, go subscribe. Also, the where your kid podcast is the where your kid podcast better than jocqua podcast. I personally don't think so at the end of the day, what do you say? Net net. You ever heard that expression? Net net. My brother says it all the time. Anyway, net net. I like the jocqua podcast better. Here's a thing, though. It's not like just cut and dry. You know what? There's like legit competition. Yeah. There's a thing if you were to observe them from a completely unbiased. You probably don't like the where your kid podcast because you're not in it. I can't freaking rebuttal my stuff. Maybe here's it. Maybe. But here's here yourself. Here's the. No. No. Here's the part that kind of, what is it like, is like a rebuttal to my own opinion. Where could podcasts every single one of those was like 90. Like out to 85 to 100% impactful, like every little thing, like that felt like applied to me where I can like, whether it be an idea or talking about your daughter. No. You're not applied to you. To me, there's a human man. You're something. Something's yes. There are 16 years old or whatever you are. Yeah. Yes. But and I'm not saying it doesn't apply to my daughter. I'm not saying that. I'm saying it applies to me directly, whether it be me in my own life or me, how I'm going to deal with my daughter now or my son or whatever. Like all of the things pretty much like that's kind of the. So net net. Yeah. Jockel podcast sure I like better. Maybe because there's kind of more more thing. I don't know why, but that's my answer. But I will say this. Maybe this. Maybe maybe you might be right. But maybe because there's some, there's not as many where your kid maybe. Yeah. Maybe I need more. I need more to shift over to for that to be better. I don't know. Maybe. That's on iTunes, situ. Oh, yeah. That's on that's a podcast as well that you subscribe to also YouTube. The way you can do to well there's word. Yes, speaking of YouTube. There's the Jockel podcast channel on YouTube. There's Warrior Kid podcast on YouTube which we separated so that your child won't be watching Warrior Kid podcast and then all of a sudden have the rape of Dan King podcast creep into their zone. Right. So we separated them. And they're both up there. They're both available. And also on the Jockel podcast that's where Echo puts up videos with enhancements to them. Make them make the message more impactful in his opinion. Well, hopefully we'll say hopefully. Yeah, like I said though, the Mike in the Dragons video, which is move to the top slot in my opinion for your videos, which is a bold statement. Cool. Yeah. It's a bold statement. People have got tears in their eyes from a two minute video about a kids book. That's pretty impressive. Yeah. Well, I do have to say I even had tears in my eyes. Here's the thing that's I feel. And I'm not going to be like, oh, I'm going to, I don't think it's necessarily because of me making the video. Because like, well, I don't know. I'm only speaking for myself, where, okay. So the king died. This is a story within a story. It's a story of a story in a story. So there's like three layers there. But so the idea of the king dying and then the kid being like young and having this big responsibility, he'd done his shoulder and shoulders and him being scared for some reason. I don't know. I just get just like, oh, whatever about that. Oh, I don't know. Sensitive about that kind of stuff. So when it's like you explaining it and you say it, like you're not being off tough jockel, you know, it seems like you're doing it like appropriately. It seems same. And then so it's like that. That's really what kind of affected me. And I think sure I laid it out in a way where it's like kind of delivered in the appropriate way. But is it? Oh, I was going to ask if it was more impactful because you and I know the whole story. But people that don't know the whole story that didn't have the book yet were like, oh, my god. Yeah. Because you know the whole story. It's like, oh, that's cool. But then people that didn't know the whole story were just like, oh, you know what? Actually, no, no, the thing because Jade said the same thing and he didn't read the whole story. And he and he actually had little tears in his eyes. He's like, yeah, tears in my eyes. I don't know why I like trying to act like it's just so confusing. You know, but you know, he's all like being emotional. Yeah. Yeah. I saw what went on. So that's the YouTube channel. You can subscribe to that. That'd be cool. We appreciate it. And all that stuff. And leave the big thing about if you subscribe to the YouTube channel, you need to comment about echo because the only compensation that echo receives for participation in this podcast is being able to read YouTube comments that say echo is so jacked. Yeah. So go on YouTube, subscribe. And then right echo is yoked echo is jacked echo is looking massive all that kind of stuff because that way he'll be happy. I can just pay him with that. That's what you just paid with. Yeah, that's the worst idea I've ever heard. It's not that bad. Nonetheless. But you do like none. The less you pointed it out. Did you see that? Did you do it? Did you do it? When you were like, you were like, oh, there's always someone that says I look jacked. I never said that. But anyway, anyway, psychological warfare. Okay. If you don't know what that is, is what it is. It's an album with tracks. So on iTunes and Amazon Music and stuff, an album with tracks, Jocco saying, helping you us. It's helping us. That's what he's doing. Jocco is helping us through moments of weakness when they arise. And they're all right. You can't sprint forever. Good boy. And you might instead of taking appropriate action when you realize you can't sprint forever sometimes you might want to take a little bit more rest between sets. You don't have to. But to shoot it. I want to take too much rest. You might want to. Yes, exactly right. And you will not ever jack if you're taking situations between sets. So get psychological warfare. Yes, the documents Google Play and B3. Yes. Yes. And you'll get past those moments of weakness. Because Jocco will just help me through it. Just by telling you, that's the thing that's like a little spot. You know, when you're slack, you're a little spot in reference to weightlifting. Yeah, that's the thing. Right. Because you someone's trying to lift and they can't quite get it. And so they help you lift it a little bit. They give you a little spot. So you're referencing weightlifting. Yes. But in this case. That's how you get jacked. In this case, instead of weights, it's your slacker weakness. That might come. I'm not saying we're all weak, but sometimes some of us, a lot of us are sometimes. Anyway, Jocco's there for you, boom, psychological warfare. Also, if you work out boring, even if it's not boring, get more fitness gear. So I incorporated, okay, get it from on it on it. com slash jocco. Fitness gear, roll battle ropes, rings, kettlebells, of course. To me, if you don't have the kettlebells, I feel like there's like one little element. Big small, I don't know, depends on who you are, but there's one little element of life. That's missing. I'm not a big opinion. But when I got the rings, that changed my whole workout. So what I do, you know, you do a bunch of cool stuff on rings. I only do a handful of things. Actually, I don't even have like two, three things. One of the main ones are like, you know, when you, I make them go super low, like maybe waste, maybe handstand push ups and no bra. I'm still a beginner at the rings. But so I'll hold them in front of me and then I'll do it. It's kind of like a ab roller kind of thing. So it's one arm at a time or both arms. Both arms. And then sometimes I'll go like, why didn't you narrow whatever. So I'll do those. I'll do like sets of 10. And you can adjust like how high it's. So hard and easier it is, whatever. But I'll let me drop the ground. We can go to a full extension. You can't get there. I'm going to get there. Nonetheless, between every exercise, actually, no, between every set, you do a set of 10. That's like the workout. Because it's not super exhausting to do it. You know, so it's like an active rest. Good man, I think it'll it'll take your like workout to the next. The thing people say that to the next level, that doesn't mean anything to the main. I guess even if it doesn't take it, if it takes to the will help you get jacked. Let me briefly explain what that means to the next level. So like when you do, I don't know dead lifts or I don't know shoulder pressure something. Like when you're. God is you can see curls. Oh, big to curls and try to get extension. When you do these things, you're like, since you're like, core, whatever is stronger. And this is just what I'm like, you feel when you, you're, of course, strong as feels like you have way better balance. You have like way better control of of the weight so you get stronger overall. Boom. Just just from rings. Yeah. Anyway, yeah, anyway, on it.com, that's where you get all this cool stuff. If you want to get your mind smarter and tougher and get your brain more jacked. We've got some books, Mike in the dragons, that is out. There are more being printed at this time. I'm printing as many as humanly possible order it immediately so that I know and I can get it to you. It's coming. So it's we've shipped out some. We got some more coming in right now. So yeah, if you haven't ordered it, ordered it yet, then order it now. The feedback is awesome right now. And thank you for posting the reviews on Amazon. That's so cool to read and see little pictures of kids reading the book. And I'm just super stoked on that book. So thank you for that and way the warrior kid for the kids. I don't know, maybe just a little bit older. That's a book about getting on the path for kids. And it's going to help them in every possible element of their life that I can think of right now. It will, it will help them. I think so. It'll make them smarter. It'll make them work harder. It'll make them understand discipline. It'll make them stronger. It'll just help them across the board. That's way the warrior kid and the follow on mission. The follow on book to that is way the warrior kid marks mission. The next is the discipline equals field. The discipline equals freedom field manual, which is a book about how to get after it. Yeah. The book. It's the book about how to get. It is not a throw away. A book by any stretch. No. It is. How would you describe it? I mean, annual. It's a manual, but I mean, instrument. No, what's the word you used earlier? Esthetically. Esthetically. Could you possibly look, just look, the external part, just the cover of the field manual and think maybe I'll do a little extra work today. Yes. That is entirely possible. Yeah. Was you know what's in it? Get after it material. Yeah. And I was thinking about this too, not extensive thought, but there's an audio version of this. True. True. Which is cool, which is good. But it's kind of like one of those things where you kind of like, man, I kind of want the physical book. Even if I'm more of an audio book person, I want that physical book because of it's aesthetics heavy. It's heavy. It has black pages. Let's just put it to you. That. Let's start with that. Have you ever seen a book with black pages? No, you haven't. No. Get the field manual right there. If you do want the audio version, then it's on iTunes, Amazon, and music, Google Play. It's not on audible because I wanted you to be able to use it as a alarm. Some of those things, little warnings. Yeah. Tracks ready to be played at a moment's notice. Yeah. And that's the thing too, where if you time, if you set up a timer, where when you were going to lunch, sugarcooked, or a recorded live play, you can check. Oh, man, perfect example. Because the thing is, some of these chapters or whatever, you're going to identify with more than the next chapter. Especially if you like donuts or pasteries, the sugarcooked live is one. You're going to be referencing that a little bit more, right? So we're sick. Okay. So you have that option now. That's good to put it on the timer. Good. Check. Yeah. Next book is, well, I'll talk about two books together. Extreme ownership and dichotomy and leadership. These are two books about the lessons learned on the battlefield. Myself and Lave Babin wrote the books. He was in task, you know, bruiser as the Charlie Patoon commander. And we took the lessons that we learned over there. We brought him back. We started teaching them to the seals that were getting ready to deploy. And we wrote extreme ownership. When we got out and started working with companies and saw that all the lessons that we learned. Transferred to the civilian sector. And then we wrote the dichotomy leadership as a follow-on book, which some people are saying is better. I don't know which one is better. But I do know that they will make you better. They will make you a better leader. So check those out. Extreme ownership dichotomy leadership. Mikey in the dragons way the warrior kid marks mission and discipline equals freedom. Field manual. You can get your brain jacked. Which is the word of the day. Echo echelon front. That's a leadership consultancy. We solve problems through leadership. So if you have a team, if you have a company, if you have a business and you want to get your leadership aligned. And you want to get them functioning at the highest level. You can go to echelon front.com. We solve problems through leadership. That's what we do. We got the muster coming in 2019. Chicago and Denver. And we're also doing Sydney.

We actually turned people away. We turned a pretty good number of people away from musters. And we're going to have an inseparantist going that. That doesn't feel good. You feel kind of bad. So trying to register early for that. And then of course, EF overwatch. This is where we are taking people from our old community.
