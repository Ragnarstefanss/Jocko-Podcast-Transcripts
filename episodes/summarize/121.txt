and, you know, for a while, you know, I was listening and then, you know, of course I was like, yeah, you know, that sounds like, sounds like you'd be well-prepared for the physical aspects of it. They're just as passionate about that as some guy, like, because that job, it's a little bit different, but a lot of that parts of that job are, you know, when we had Brian Stan on, we talked about this, you know, like Brian Stan was, you get to be in charge of more people, you get, it's a different dynamic, but the combat leadership opportunities and just the combat opportunities. They say, forget where I read this, but people who come back from war, they kind of differentiated where people who were in it, like JPE and you and I just always wanted to do this, to be a combat leader, to be a Navy SEAL, to be a commando, typically people with that kind of attitude, they don't get affected by it because it's kind of like the thing. It was like, if a guy's fractured going in, it doesn't matter if he's special operations or conventional forces or general purpose units, he's, if he's fractured going in, the war's going to mess him up. But when you have to remember that the reason you become a seal is so you can go and fight in wars and you're going to kill people and you're going to be at the risk of dying and you're going to be at the risk of being wounded and that's what's going to happen to your friends if not you. Because it's what he's talking about right here, which is, hey, you know, it's travel and adventure and career opportunities like no, what it is is war and savagery and the worst things that you could possibly experience is what you're going to experience. And so I said, hey, oh man, no, I think, I said, you know, I could tell, yeah, like a high-intite. One day, the men were told that their orders had come and they were packed to leave for Hoboken New Jersey to ship out for France, meaning they were going to war. So that was, you know, he gets pulled out, going back to the book, Lieutenant Colonel Polar is being recommended by General Vandagriff for the Medal of Honor for leading his battalion with seven holes in him continually for 24 hours. Yeah, the special operations and the conclusion for what I was reading there was, people when they go in knowing and kind of how they put it, like forward leaning into the realities of a military situation, it tends to be special operations or guys who want to do it for that reason. Because otherwise the publisher thinks, oh, well, we won't make that many of them because there's not that many people that, you know, we're going to buy this in the wrong because you all are going to buy this. And of course there's a big bunch of reporters waiting for him and they kind of know they kind of know he's got a mouth I want you people to know something, as long as we can get some decent leadership in our country, are youth to today will be better men than their fathers or grandfathers. Write your people back home and tell them there's one hell of a damn war going on out here and that the Raggedy-tailed North Koreans have been whipping a lot of so-called Get-American troops and may do it again. If we make our men tough in the mind before they go to war and give them an honest idea of what war is like, we won't have so much of this trouble. I'm going to like, you happen like to your experience, right? A common touch the men liked Fuller said, though a few of the clouds were its type officers in the rear-ranked Snickard behind his back, the men knew he was real. And he ends up going to the basic school, which is like the officer with the officers sort of get trained in all the fundamental principles of combat for the Marine Corps. You know, it's kind of like when Remo and I was talking about Steve Jobs, a couple podcasts going on. He went up in an elevator with an army doctor who seemed on point on the point of tears, going to the words and see those kids and you'll soon know more about more than you want about Korea. The combat people run things when the chips are down and the country's life is at stake, but when the gun stop, nobody's got use for a combat man. Yeah, that's, that's, I haven't really heard that point, but you know what you knew here people talk about leaders and managers and I've worked with companies and it's a good, a good sentiment, right? Colonel, I'm a field soldier, Lajoon said, I don't give a damn what men look like in the field. I did that because as you know from listening to this podcast, there's some podcasts that are for very mature audiences and you wouldn't want to have your kid listening to that, you know, a kid podcast and all of a sudden a very violent podcast comes on. In order to find out who this man is, we are going to explore a book called Marine, the life of Chestie Polar, written by Burke Davis. Back to the book, General McDougall recommended Polar for a Navy Cross, citing five fights against, so this is after he's been there for a little while, citing five fights against a period of numbers without lost to himself, the nine-known enemy dead and numerous, but uncounted wounded, and the impressive loot of munitions, animals, food, and captured military dispatches. The practice of having command post exercises, Polar said, though he realized that he was trading on prominent toes in his audience, we take skeleton forces of headquarters troops and the like, just a handful and go through exercises so often that we forget we aren't simulating that we aren't simulating actual warfare. He said, only men, I'd rather be toting a rifle in a rear rank than going out now as lieutenant general. Good evening, I'm going to tell you a story and this is a story of war and pain and love and death. The old man would sneak off with Body and go up into the lines, climbing right up into those dams, straight up hills, all the ice and rock going from hold to hole for half the night. Please tell Lewis that I will finally come home and teach him how to shoot and many other things that boys and men must know. But also in the book, you're going to see over and over again that there's a huge dichotomy that he's super hard core, but at the same time, he knows when he needs to give people slack.
