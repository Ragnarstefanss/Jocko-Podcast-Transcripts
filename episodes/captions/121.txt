[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 121 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening,
[00:00:07] I'm going to tell you a story and this is a story of war and pain and love and death.
[00:00:32] And this story, this is a heroic story, quite possibly one of the most heroic stories
[00:00:45] and at the same time, this story is also a tragedy.
[00:00:52] And it is quite possibly one of the most tragic stories.
[00:01:01] And this is a story of a father and a son.
[00:01:04] This is a story that spans six wars, each one more difficult than the next.
[00:01:14] This is a story of life.
[00:01:21] And like all stories of life, this story ends the way that all lives end this story ends
[00:01:31] in death.
[00:01:35] There is no story book ending.
[00:01:38] There is no walking off into the sunset.
[00:01:40] There is no mercy and no quarter and no remorse from death.
[00:01:49] And as I prepared to tell this story, there were times when I started to decide against it.
[00:02:03] Where I began to think it would be too much.
[00:02:11] There was another part of me.
[00:02:14] That spoke louder and spoke stronger and that other part of me that knows that to hide
[00:02:21] from the darkness, he's only to allow darkness to grow and I will not do that.
[00:02:31] I will tell this story and the story that I am going to tell is not just a story,
[00:02:36] it is not made up.
[00:02:40] The story is the real story of the real lives of two men, two marines, a father and a son
[00:02:51] who fought many battles, both literally and metaphorically and who did their best to fight
[00:03:04] and win and who we can both learn a lot from.
[00:03:17] But we can only learn if we listen, we can only learn if we study and we can only learn
[00:03:23] if we remember what these men went through, what they did.
[00:03:33] How they lived and how they died.
[00:03:42] I will begin the story with the father.
[00:03:47] He is the most famous marine in the history of the Marine Corps.
[00:03:54] He is one of the most highly decorated men in American military history.
[00:04:00] He is the only man ever awarded five Navy crosses.
[00:04:08] His name is Louis Polar, better known as Chestie Polar.
[00:04:17] He is to most marines the ultimate marine.
[00:04:22] The godfather of the Marine Corps to this day, the mascot of the Marine Corps, which is a bulldog
[00:04:29] that bulldog is named Chestie after Chestie Polar.
[00:04:36] They are currently on bulldog number 15 named Chestie the 15th in boot camp in Marine Corps
[00:04:45] boot camp recruits saying, good night Chestie at the end of a long day.
[00:04:52] He is embedded in the fiber of the Marine Corps.
[00:05:00] Then you might wonder who was this man and how did he become an icon to a group that
[00:05:08] is one of the most elite fighting forces in the history of mankind in the United States Marine
[00:05:14] Corps.
[00:05:17] In order to find out who this man is, we are going to explore a book called Marine,
[00:05:24] the life of Chestie Polar, written by Burke Davis.
[00:05:33] And I will go to the book.
[00:05:39] Louis Burwell Polar was born June 26th, 1898 into a small boys paradise.
[00:05:46] The village of West Point, Virginia, with a pommunki and Patamoni rivers formed the
[00:05:54] broad York.
[00:05:57] The waters were full of fish, crab and oysters, and the woodlands teamed with game.
[00:06:05] Sounds like a good place to grow up.
[00:06:08] He often talked of his dream of going to the Virginia Military Institute and becoming a soldier.
[00:06:15] He was reading his family traditions, his love of hunting, fishing, and horseback riding.
[00:06:19] He was drawn to a military life in VMI.
[00:06:25] Fifty years later, at the end of a fighting career, he would look back to those days and say,
[00:06:29] I learned more in the woods, hunting and stalking about the actual art of war than I ever
[00:06:34] learned in any school of any kind.
[00:06:37] Those days in the woods as a kid saved my life many a time and combat.
[00:06:44] Where he wanted to go in the military from a very young age.
[00:06:48] And of course, I always have to mention that I'm going to go very rapidly through this
[00:06:53] book.
[00:06:54] They may take a while, but I'm skipping huge parts and trying to hit the highlights.
[00:07:00] But to get the full information, obviously, you need to get the book and read it yourself.
[00:07:04] It's a fantastic book.
[00:07:09] To the book, his efforts at translating Caesar made him inpatient for the true message
[00:07:19] of the soldier author.
[00:07:20] He was so fascinated by the narrative of war that he devoured it in one night.
[00:07:26] It opened a new world for him and began a lifelong career of serious military reading.
[00:07:32] It's a common theme we see with great military leaders.
[00:07:35] They read all the time.
[00:07:36] And it started for him in a young age when he was translating Caesar.
[00:07:42] He was captain of a track team.
[00:07:44] It's champion high jumper and ran well in the 120 and 440 yard dashes.
[00:07:51] So he was fairly athletic.
[00:07:53] Although he's not a big guy.
[00:07:56] He was not a big guy.
[00:07:57] When you see pictures of him, he was pretty, he was relatively small and stature.
[00:08:00] And he was also relatively, you know, he wasn't like a bulked up guy.
[00:08:05] And there's stories on why they called him Chesty.
[00:08:09] The predominant story is even though he was small when he would march on the parade
[00:08:14] ground.
[00:08:15] He would stick his chest out.
[00:08:16] So they called him Chesty Poole.
[00:08:19] Back to the book.
[00:08:20] In the last week of high school, 1917, the senior class played hooky one day on the
[00:08:24] fury which proved to be correct that the principal would not dare expel them all.
[00:08:28] Lewis was the leader of this prank.
[00:08:30] When they returned from a swim and a six mile hike to the river, he helped to bring back
[00:08:35] a dozen or more bull frogs in paper bags.
[00:08:39] Lewis and Dave feel tossed the frogs into a school room window and were rewarded by
[00:08:44] screams and other sounds of pandemonium.
[00:08:49] So he's, you know, I had to tell at least one of those stories that he was a mischievous
[00:08:54] kid, you know, a little bit of a rebel.
[00:08:58] The enrolled he did graduate enrolled in the military military of Virginia military institute.
[00:09:04] And back to the book, Lewis was promoted to cadet corp.
[00:09:07] At the end of the year, academically he stood 177th out of 233 cadets.
[00:09:13] So, well, not like the front runner in the class.
[00:09:16] His subject standings in his class mathematics, 200th English 149th German 138th history,
[00:09:23] 100nd and most significantly military science 89th.
[00:09:29] He had no demerits for the year and almost unheard of record.
[00:09:32] So academically, not exactly crushing it, but military bearing in what not no demerits.
[00:09:40] He was doing well.
[00:09:42] Now this is where things start to get a little bit interesting.
[00:09:44] Obviously, it's 1917.
[00:09:45] So we got World War I is going on.
[00:09:48] And here we go back to the book.
[00:09:50] As Chief Disappointment was that they were soldiers without arms.
[00:09:54] For the rifles were taken by the army as the war in Europe war on and ammunition had been
[00:09:59] two scarce for target practice.
[00:10:03] With that, he said, I'm going to enlist in the Marines.
[00:10:09] He said, I don't want the war to end without me.
[00:10:12] I'm going with the rifles.
[00:10:14] If they need them, they need me too.
[00:10:18] In June 27th, the day after his 20th birthday, Louis took the train to Richmond and enlisted
[00:10:22] in the Marine Corps, bound for boot camp at Parasiland, South Carolina.
[00:10:28] So I wasn't going to sit around and let that war run out on him.
[00:10:35] Shows up for his boot camp.
[00:10:39] There's a drill instructor.
[00:10:41] One of the great things about this book is the guy that wrote the book, Burke Davis.
[00:10:45] He not only sat down and interviewed Chester Poler for hundreds of hours.
[00:10:49] He also went and interviewed all kinds of people that interacted with Chester Puler during
[00:10:55] his career, which he interacted with a lot of people, because he was in the Marine Corps for
[00:10:58] a really long time for decades.
[00:11:01] And so the book has all kinds of research and all kinds of interviews.
[00:11:06] And one of the people that got interviewed was the drill instructor, one of the drill instructors
[00:11:10] that put Chester Puler through boot camp.
[00:11:15] John Structor, I think it was a gun research and Desparais.
[00:11:20] And he said, by God, he's a Marine.
[00:11:23] He looks as if he must sleep at attention.
[00:11:26] You always know I have to tell him to look mean and nasty out there marching, but I never
[00:11:30] had to tell him.
[00:11:31] He's a natural.
[00:11:32] He never makes the same mistake twice.
[00:11:37] And he talked about, he talked about Poler's military history knowledge.
[00:11:40] He said, hell, he gives me an inferiority complex.
[00:11:43] I've read some, but that kid does Von Klausowitz backwards.
[00:11:47] And guys, guys I never heard of.
[00:11:49] By the dozen, he's some kid.
[00:11:51] This stuff is like a religion with him.
[00:11:55] So that's real stuff right there.
[00:11:58] You know, we hear General Mattis talk about that too.
[00:12:00] General Mattis never gets surprised because he's read it before.
[00:12:03] Not gonna surprise me, because I already know, I already seen the situation before.
[00:12:07] I'm not exact, but I at least have an idea of it.
[00:12:10] The non-combs admired Poler's work on the bayonet field where big signs read advance to kill.
[00:12:21] For two months, the class went through intensive drills in the bayonet rifle boxing judo
[00:12:27] and infantry drill.
[00:12:29] So back in the day, they're still getting after it.
[00:12:31] And boxing in judo, by the way, is good combination.
[00:12:33] Very good combination.
[00:12:34] You take down, you get your grappling, and you get some striking.
[00:12:39] One day, the men were told that their orders had come and they were packed to leave for
[00:12:44] Hoboken New Jersey to ship out for France, meaning they were going to war.
[00:12:51] The move was postponed for several days until Arnes disday canceled the orders.
[00:12:57] So the end of the war came.
[00:13:00] He was detached and sent to the third officer's training school.
[00:13:05] So they took him and said, you know what, you did so good in boot camp.
[00:13:08] The war's over, we don't have orders, we're gonna send you to be an officer.
[00:13:12] Back to the book, he became a second lieutenant on June 4th two weeks later when he had
[00:13:16] finished machine gun school.
[00:13:17] The end of the war brought a huge cut in the Marine Corps.
[00:13:20] On June 16th, Poler was discharged with hundreds of others of his rank and he was at
[00:13:26] loose ends, he'd been a Marine officer for two weeks.
[00:13:31] Now as he's kind of processing out, he met a guy named Captain Rupertis at the Marine
[00:13:36] Corps headquarters and this is what the advice he gave him.
[00:13:40] You know, he sees this young hard charter and says, if I were you, I'd go down to Haiti.
[00:13:44] You'll get commissions in the in the constabler down there and they need good men.
[00:13:49] And there's plenty of fighting.
[00:13:51] You'd see action and have some fun.
[00:13:53] So at this point in Haiti, they'd basically built this, it's, it's a John D'Amouri,
[00:14:06] as well as John D'Amouri, as what they call it.
[00:14:08] But it's a military force that also does police work kind of.
[00:14:15] So and there was a revolution in Haiti, there was issues in Haiti and so America actually
[00:14:20] invaded Haiti in 1915.
[00:14:22] And now they had established this force to keep things under control and the way they did
[00:14:28] it, it was run, they took the locals and they put basically hired former Marines to
[00:14:37] be in charge of them.
[00:14:38] And then the goal was as the locals, the native Haitians, started to understand military
[00:14:46] operations, they would get promoted and the American Marines and soldiers could go home.
[00:14:51] That was the plan.
[00:14:52] So let's see, kind of just covered this.
[00:14:56] But Haiti was striped, was the striped torn, western tip of the island shared with the Dominican
[00:15:01] Republic, revolution had been shaken.
[00:15:03] The government's is 1914, after almost a century of freedom from France since 1916.
[00:15:08] At the request of the Haitian government, Marines had police the country, amid violence
[00:15:12] which had taken nearly 2,000 lives, almost all Haitians.
[00:15:16] General Schmedley, smoothly butler who will get to sometime on this podcast, had created
[00:15:22] the John D'Amouri de Haiti with a true disregard for precedent.
[00:15:29] The senior officers were US Marine officers who's briefed tours of two years created
[00:15:33] a supply of field-trained commanders.
[00:15:35] But he chose the Marine and listed men to act as junior officers and allowed them to stay
[00:15:42] as long as they wish on the theory that they became more valuable as they learned the language
[00:15:47] and customs of the people.
[00:15:49] In practice it was these Marines, these Marines and listed men who operated the force.
[00:15:55] Under them were many native soldiers, most of them veterans of the old Haitian army.
[00:15:59] From this pool they were drawn second-to-tenits and sergeants and corporals.
[00:16:02] That's what you have.
[00:16:03] That's the situation.
[00:16:04] So he deployed down there.
[00:16:05] He's not really in the Marine Corps.
[00:16:07] He's a hired hand basically.
[00:16:12] So now he's there, not for very long, and back to the book about 4pm without warning, Lewis
[00:16:18] stumbled into the first fight of his career and proved his instinct for combat.
[00:16:22] The pack train, this is a group he was moving, a group of people through the woods.
[00:16:27] The pack train was ambling around a wooded bent between hills which were littered with stones
[00:16:32] and cactus.
[00:16:33] When it meant an oncoming caco band, this is the revolutionaries I guess you call them.
[00:16:37] The caco band of about 100 equally surprised and in the same formation.
[00:16:42] All their sport is spurred his horse and yelled charge attack.
[00:16:47] The column charged horses, pack meals and all.
[00:16:51] And in the thunder and dust, fierce gels of the caco's broke for the hills, firing a few
[00:16:55] stray rounds.
[00:16:56] So that was kind of his first combat experience.
[00:16:58] You got to bring that up.
[00:17:02] But he was defalte aggressive even in an logistics movement.
[00:17:10] So they got a bunch of pack horses and he's like, oh, charge.
[00:17:14] And it worked.
[00:17:17] Back to the book, another situation that he gets into from the opposite shore, a native and
[00:17:22] Dominican dress wrote out on a magnificent horse, a big buckskin with white mane and tail
[00:17:27] who splashed through the shallows under perfect control, though without a bridal or saddle.
[00:17:33] A wonderful horse, Polar said, I'd surely like to have him.
[00:17:38] Bruno, who's one of the guys, one of the natives that was working under him, muttered
[00:17:42] and creole and a rifle cracked.
[00:17:45] Polar saw one of his men.
[00:17:47] Poled his rifle bolt back and ejected cartridge.
[00:17:50] The beautiful horse stood in the river looking nervous about his rider floated down the
[00:17:55] stream in a stain of blood.
[00:17:59] The stunned polar turned to Bruno.
[00:18:02] Did you order that man shot?
[00:18:04] Tell Sir, you said you wanted the horse.
[00:18:07] Anything the captain says is our command.
[00:18:09] We have discipline here, Sir.
[00:18:12] The man seemed unmoved by the cold blooded killing.
[00:18:15] My God, catch the horse, get the men over the river and see if you can find that man's
[00:18:19] family.
[00:18:20] And the reason I pulled this out is this line right here.
[00:18:26] Lewis never again expressed himself idly before these soldiers.
[00:18:29] So that's a crazy story, right?
[00:18:31] He says, oh, that's a beautiful horse.
[00:18:32] I love to have that horse and they kill the horse riders just to civilian.
[00:18:37] But he realized the power that you have and command.
[00:18:40] And there's sometimes when people don't realize that.
[00:18:42] People don't realize how I run in that with business leaders.
[00:18:45] They'll walk around.
[00:18:46] Oh, this is crap.
[00:18:48] And everyone thinks it's crap that.
[00:18:51] Or you've got to realize that your words have meaning.
[00:18:55] And when you're in a senior position, your words have power.
[00:18:57] And so that was how he learned that lesson in a very horrible way.
[00:19:02] Back to the book, company A had waited the stream without opposition.
[00:19:06] But as they mounted the ridge beyond the rifle fired and there was a terrifying streak
[00:19:10] of a bullet overhead, Polar duct.
[00:19:14] Lieutenant Leigh D. was at his side and said Captain Polar officers do not flinch under
[00:19:20] fire.
[00:19:21] They stand the men take note of this thing.
[00:19:24] It is of first importance.
[00:19:27] So he's going to get plenty of exercise in that.
[00:19:30] And you'll see he becomes well known for never flinching again under fire.
[00:19:36] Here's something about the people they were fighting these Kaco bandits.
[00:19:39] They carry off everybody and every wounded man.
[00:19:43] And when they catch our wounded, well, Captain, if you see one, you'll never forget.
[00:19:47] The Kaco's believe every man who dies must go before the gods.
[00:19:50] And they use their knives to see that when our men go, they are beyond recognition.
[00:19:55] They slash the face to ribbons and tear the body apart.
[00:19:58] You will see, Captain, it's a matter of life or death for the officers and non-commissioned
[00:20:04] officers here to respect, to have respect of the, from the men.
[00:20:09] And something more adulation.
[00:20:11] They must obey orders to the letter without question, though they die for it.
[00:20:15] There's the only way to handle men in combat.
[00:20:18] If you lose control, you lose lives.
[00:20:21] It is as simple as that.
[00:20:23] So there you see the super strict discipline that they're into.
[00:20:26] And this is something that you're going to see this theme throughout the book that
[00:20:30] Chesty has this, this, this reputation, which is earned of being super hard core.
[00:20:38] But also in the book, you're going to see over and over again that there's a huge dichotomy
[00:20:42] that he's super hard core, but at the same time, he knows when he needs to give people
[00:20:46] slack.
[00:20:47] He knows when he needs to be a positive reinforcement instead of a negative one.
[00:20:50] And his, his reputation doesn't have that.
[00:20:53] But that line right there, like, hey, they just need to do whatever you say.
[00:20:57] He doesn't even believe that.
[00:20:59] But it's, it's pointed out.
[00:21:00] And so I brought it up because the contradiction becomes pretty clear or not the contradiction,
[00:21:04] but the dichotomy is very clear throughout this book.
[00:21:09] So back to the book.
[00:21:12] General John A. Lajoon, common don of the core, had come to Haiti on inspection and Lewis
[00:21:17] was anxious to see the hero of the fighting in France.
[00:21:20] And campus union isn't called the campus union for nothing.
[00:21:25] And at this point, Marine Patrol filed pass, and this is a good, another, another good lesson.
[00:21:30] They were unshaven and ill-camped.
[00:21:34] I'm afraid the men are a little ragged and out of uniform, sir, and the company commander
[00:21:39] Clinton said, I'm trying to improve them.
[00:21:43] Colonel, I'm a field soldier, Lajoon said, I don't give a damn what men look like in
[00:21:48] the field.
[00:21:50] Only one thing interests me, and that's ending this war.
[00:21:53] Don't waste your time shining them up for jungle work.
[00:21:56] Our only objective is success, and I demand that.
[00:22:00] So there's a contradiction right there.
[00:22:01] Like, well, not a contradiction, but there's the dichotomy.
[00:22:04] And he's here now, the other side is here and this from General Lajoon, who's saying, look,
[00:22:08] I don't care what these guys look like in the field.
[00:22:10] You don't need to polish them up.
[00:22:12] They need to win.
[00:22:13] They need to be fighting.
[00:22:14] And Chesteepolic becomes very famous for the way he appears sometimes in the field.
[00:22:18] Meaning he's not exactly spit and polish out there.
[00:22:23] He was awarded the Medal military of the Republic of Haiti.
[00:22:32] And he did not go unnoticed by his superiors in early in 1921.
[00:22:39] He was recommended for a permanent commission in the Marine Corps, whereas rank was now
[00:22:44] that of sergeant.
[00:22:46] He served as a agent to Colonel Van Degreff, this is another famous Marine.
[00:22:52] He again became a second lieutenant, US Marine Corps, but this time is a regular.
[00:22:57] I may not have much else to go on, he told a friend, but I have some perseverance.
[00:23:02] He had fought in 40 actions.
[00:23:05] In Haiti, he developed his instinct.
[00:23:08] He developed his instinctive talent for using terrain and battle and learned the lessons
[00:23:12] of jungle fighting.
[00:23:13] He had become strongly prejudiced against barracks and headquarters soldiers.
[00:23:19] Despite his youth, he was one of the most combat officers in the court.
[00:23:23] So he got noticed because he did well in combat.
[00:23:27] He eventually gets hired on into the Marine Corps as a sergeant.
[00:23:33] And then very quickly thereafter goes back to the off-choranks after he's working for
[00:23:37] a Colonel Van Degreff.
[00:23:38] So there you go.
[00:23:40] And you can see he develops his prejudicing, its barracks and headquarters soldiers.
[00:23:44] Re-recial on is what we call him.
[00:23:50] Now after he came back to the state, he gets chosen to run the Marine Corps drill team,
[00:23:59] who has apparently competing and the head had been winning against the Navy and the Army
[00:24:04] and the Coast Guard teams.
[00:24:05] They've been beating them.
[00:24:07] And so he takes over.
[00:24:08] So here we go, private Bob Norris, a company clerk drafted for the detachment, shared
[00:24:12] the astonishment of his mates.
[00:24:14] The lieutenant told us the first day that we would bring home the cup or die trying.
[00:24:18] And from the cold eye, he gave us, we believed it.
[00:24:21] We found out we found we weren't mistaken.
[00:24:23] He took out the silent drill manual and started us from scratch.
[00:24:27] He drove us day after day until we figured we'd never lived to see Boston.
[00:24:31] When he was through with us, we literally thought as if we had one head instead of 80.
[00:24:36] We had somehow, though he was hard as nails, he could be his friendly.
[00:24:40] He could be friendly with us like no other officer we'd ever seen.
[00:24:44] We gave him all we had.
[00:24:45] So there you go, driving people hard, but they love him.
[00:24:48] And they love him because he treats him with respect and he's nice to him.
[00:24:50] And that's the dichotomy.
[00:24:52] And he knows he instinctively how to walk that line in that dichotomy leadership.
[00:24:59] Back to the book a few weeks afterwards, Polar was whisked off to his next duty station.
[00:25:03] A sign is a flying cadet in Pensacola, Florida, a chance, which he had been pleading
[00:25:07] since his first flights and he improvised Jenny Bombered Hayders.
[00:25:10] So I didn't cover this part in the book, but when he was in Haiti, he did flights and dropped
[00:25:16] grenades on enemy locations and he was into it.
[00:25:20] And he gets down to Pensacola and fails his two solo tests.
[00:25:27] He left Pensacola disappointed and interestingly, three years after this happened,
[00:25:35] he tried to reapply.
[00:25:39] And this is an interesting comment.
[00:25:40] The medical board in Washington to answer to his plea for one more chance found him physically
[00:25:45] fit to fly, but not temperamentally adapted for aviation training.
[00:25:51] So that's interesting.
[00:25:52] You know, that this guy who's obviously great combat leaders didn't have whatever they were
[00:25:57] looking for for flying, he didn't have it.
[00:26:01] And he made multiple attempts.
[00:26:06] When he went back home for a little while, he went to a dance.
[00:26:11] And there's some sort of interesting fact that that's the way they did it back in the
[00:26:17] day.
[00:26:18] He went to a dance and he met a woman named Virginia Evans.
[00:26:24] He danced with her three times with fumbling attempts at conversation during the next
[00:26:28] dance.
[00:26:29] He made up his mind.
[00:26:30] His manner became assured, will you marry me?
[00:26:34] She laughed.
[00:26:35] Heavens know how can I do that when I haven't even finished the school.
[00:26:38] You will.
[00:26:40] He spent the night in the stag line watching and dancing with her.
[00:26:43] She noticed that he danced with no other girl after that meeting.
[00:26:47] He did not see her again for almost 11 years, but he never lifted the long range siege.
[00:26:55] He gets his mind committed to something.
[00:26:57] And Virginia Evans was what he was committed to.
[00:26:59] He gets shipped off to Hawaii in July of 1926.
[00:27:05] He shows up there.
[00:27:07] Another interesting story.
[00:27:08] Lewis held firm discipline in his company.
[00:27:11] And some men were probably resentful until they learned that he spared himself less than
[00:27:16] he did others.
[00:27:17] He was ruthless with violators of safety precautions where firearms were involved.
[00:27:21] And every time a man shot a weapon on the base without good reason, the fine was automatically
[00:27:25] $20.
[00:27:26] One day on inspection, Polar saw 45 in the guard house picked it up, released the clip, and
[00:27:32] pulled the slide and the trigger.
[00:27:34] The gun fired unexpectedly in a bullet furled into the ceiling.
[00:27:39] Justi Polar had an AD and accidental discharge.
[00:27:43] So he had taken all the precautions except to look in the firing chamber, Polar fined
[00:27:47] himself $100, which he gave to the guards to buy beer for a Liberty party.
[00:27:54] He bombarded headquarters with police to send him to Nicaragua, where War had broken out.
[00:27:59] And Marines were trying to put down a native bandit uprising.
[00:28:03] So War is going on in Nicaragua and he says, hey, send me down there.
[00:28:08] Back the book, Nicaragua is even more rugged than Haiti than Haiti.
[00:28:11] The green rolling country of jungle and planes dominated by towering highlands upon which
[00:28:16] were tumbled mountain masses.
[00:28:18] For many years, revolutions had torn the land despite the presence of US Marines.
[00:28:22] And now a bitter new war had called them back after years absence.
[00:28:26] In the North lay an unconquered Indian empire, whose people did not recognize the central
[00:28:32] government.
[00:28:33] And there, where he moved back and forth across the border of Honduras was the rebel chief.
[00:28:39] Augusto, Augusto, Caesar, San Dino.
[00:28:44] So that's what's going on in Nicaragua.
[00:28:49] Chester Polar shows up reported to General E. R. Biedle.
[00:28:52] And he says, I'll give you a company up in the Sago V. S.
[00:28:56] In the North.
[00:28:57] I understand you like to mix it up.
[00:29:00] Big mix up.
[00:29:02] Big mix it up.
[00:29:04] So this is again, you know, there's so many things that he does that just build this incredible
[00:29:12] reputation that he ends up with.
[00:29:15] And here's one of them.
[00:29:16] The native boss with a fire eating brigand who had been appointed as the local Hefe
[00:29:23] Polatico.
[00:29:25] Polar invaded his office accompanied by a sergeant and in brief words told the terrorist
[00:29:29] that he had come to restore order and that trouble, trouble makers would be would fair
[00:29:34] badly.
[00:29:35] He ended quietly.
[00:29:37] You will be held responsible for any further disorder with your life.
[00:29:43] As he talked, he saw partially open drawer in the desk before the chief and the butt of
[00:29:47] a revolver.
[00:29:48] The boss looked as if he wanted to snatch the pistol.
[00:29:52] Go ahead, Polar said, use it if you can.
[00:29:54] We'll settle this once and for all, you'd better be fast.
[00:30:00] Like who does that?
[00:30:02] I'll tell you who does that, Chester.
[00:30:04] Polar does that.
[00:30:07] Polar's career as a guerrilla fighter now opened in earnest.
[00:30:10] In February 1930, he was ordered to clear bandits from the area of San Antonio.
[00:30:15] Bill Lee, who had earlier served three years in Nicaragua, had been pleading for a chance
[00:30:20] to return.
[00:30:21] This tall musculoskelet from Massachusetts, who had been 16 years in the corn, was conditioned
[00:30:27] by years of playing fullback on the team of a coal burning battle ship and by boxing
[00:30:32] and pulling an ore on a crew.
[00:30:35] Polar unhesitatingly chose him to help direct company M and Lee and Lewis found Lee, found
[00:30:42] Lewis an ideal commander.
[00:30:46] This is classic.
[00:30:48] This is what Lee says about his commander, which is Chester Polar.
[00:30:52] He never really gave me orders.
[00:30:54] He just told me what headquarters wanted, asked me if I knew the country, and to get
[00:30:59] up the men we needed.
[00:31:01] He was a common sense officer, and you always knew where you stood with him.
[00:31:06] When he was displeased about something I'd done, he never chewed me out, as so many inexperienced
[00:31:10] officers would have done.
[00:31:13] He would say, if I'd been doing that, I'd have done it this way.
[00:31:18] And that would be the end of it.
[00:31:20] We got all my brothers.
[00:31:21] Most important of all, he was not green when he first came to Nicaragua, Haiti had taught
[00:31:25] him jungle fighting, and he took the new country like an native.
[00:31:29] That paragraph right there is just so important, especially again, when people get the
[00:31:36] image of a marine and of justi Polar that he's just going to whip everyone into shape.
[00:31:41] Like no, that's not a good leader.
[00:31:43] That is not a good leader.
[00:31:48] Back to the book, General McDougall recommended Polar for a Navy Cross, citing five fights
[00:31:57] against, so this is after he's been there for a little while, citing five fights against
[00:31:59] a period of numbers without lost to himself, the nine-known enemy dead and numerous, but
[00:32:04] uncounted wounded, and the impressive loot of munitions, animals, food, and captured military
[00:32:11] dispatches.
[00:32:13] The recommendation ended thus by his intelligent and forceful leadership without thought
[00:32:19] of his own personal safety by great physical exertion and by suffering many hardships,
[00:32:25] he surrounded all obstacles and dealt five successive and severe blows against organized
[00:32:30] banditry in the Republic of Nicaragua.
[00:32:34] So there you go.
[00:32:36] That's what he's getting after down in Nicaragua.
[00:32:40] Here's another Captain E.E. Linsert, who is the intelligence officer in the Marine Brigade.
[00:32:47] He saw that some of the people were jealous.
[00:32:50] So he started getting a little bit famous.
[00:32:52] People started writing about him.
[00:32:53] There was an article in the New York Times about him and people started having some professional
[00:32:57] jealousy back to the book.
[00:32:59] And this is Lynette talking.
[00:33:00] Now and then from New York Times, now and then the New York Times got some of these stories
[00:33:05] from Nicaraguan papers and Polar's name became widely known.
[00:33:09] A few officers around headquarters who thought of themselves as clouds of its types, muddered
[00:33:14] criticisms of Polar and said he was a publicity hound.
[00:33:17] I knew that the opposite was true and that Louis spent virtually his whole life in this
[00:33:22] period on the trail, deep in enemy country, while our staff officer friends saw sat on
[00:33:27] their duffs in the cities far removed from the warfare.
[00:33:33] But you get that professional jealousy.
[00:33:34] There's a classic example of it.
[00:33:38] There's a general Julie and Smith talking about Louis Polar.
[00:33:42] He was probably the bravest man I ever knew.
[00:33:46] His was a cool courage, not one of desperation.
[00:33:49] About the only way to contact the enemy there was to let them ambush him.
[00:33:55] He would go anywhere without support knowing that if he got into jam, he had to get
[00:33:59] himself out.
[00:34:00] He never hesitated.
[00:34:01] He invited that kind of work.
[00:34:04] He was getting after it.
[00:34:11] He went home for a little while.
[00:34:12] He visited his younger brother Sam, who was also a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps.
[00:34:19] And then Polar landed in one of the army infantry schools.
[00:34:25] The army street army's infantry school.
[00:34:27] He went to that school while he was there.
[00:34:31] Sometimes had some disagreements with the staff.
[00:34:38] Here's one.
[00:34:39] One lecturer told the students that volume of fire in the field is more important.
[00:34:42] The accuracy.
[00:34:43] That brought Polar to his feet.
[00:34:45] You must have forgotten what happened in the American Revolution.
[00:34:47] He said, we won that war with accurate fire when the enemy had all the volume.
[00:34:52] It won at King's Mountain and Saratoga and every other battle we won.
[00:34:58] Real shooting almost whip the mass firing federal army in the civil war.
[00:35:03] It's still like that.
[00:35:05] Anywhere I've seen men shooting it out.
[00:35:08] You don't hurt them if you don't hit him.
[00:35:13] Great point, even though suppressive fires awesome and massive volume of fire definitely
[00:35:16] will keep the enemy down.
[00:35:18] Heads down.
[00:35:19] You gotta hit him.
[00:35:21] That's, you know, I've talked about this before.
[00:35:23] That's why in Ramadi, our machine gunners were putting scopes on their machine guns.
[00:35:31] They're part of partially doing it for to be able to identify who they were looking at.
[00:35:35] Positively identify enemy looking for weapons because you got a little magnification on
[00:35:38] their scope.
[00:35:39] They also wanted to hit what they were shooting at.
[00:35:41] Obviously our snipers and riflemen were doing that too.
[00:35:44] You gotta hit the bad guys.
[00:35:47] Back to the book.
[00:35:50] And this huge event is at that school at Fort Benning, Lewis left Benning with many new
[00:35:54] friends and all services, but most important carried away a distrust of over-schooling
[00:35:58] military men.
[00:36:02] Here's Polar talking.
[00:36:03] The trouble with this school business is that we've taken it too far.
[00:36:07] We sit around in classrooms and will the conditions of battle.
[00:36:12] Of course, in actual battle, you can't will anything, not a damn thing because the enemy
[00:36:17] will do what you don't want them to do or expect them to do almost every time.
[00:36:22] Then the results of actual warfare are studied back in the schools, the staff officers and
[00:36:26] planners, most of whom have never seen real battles, wonder what went wrong with their
[00:36:31] neat plans.
[00:36:34] You just simply cannot learn warfare in a school room or anywhere I'll accept in combat.
[00:36:40] And you'll never know whether you're fighting man until you're under fire.
[00:36:46] Yeah.
[00:36:47] He goes back to Nicaragua after that.
[00:36:59] Back to the book throughout the latter half of 1932, company M was on unseasing patrol averaging
[00:37:04] 18 to 20 miles daily on the mountain trails, stretching it some days to as much as 40
[00:37:10] miles.
[00:37:13] Aller and Lee and their troops marched more than 10,000 miles in the Nicaragua fighting
[00:37:18] always on foot for they early discovered that horsemen drew fire in every skirmish.
[00:37:23] And so they walked without the mark of officer on their uniforms.
[00:37:30] 10,000 miles.
[00:37:34] On schedule on January 2nd, 1933, the Marines began leaving Nicaragua.
[00:37:42] In February 1933, Lewis was introduced to military society and peaking at the US location.
[00:37:54] His commander pinned on his chest the star for the Navy Cross.
[00:37:58] He'd won a Nicaragua.
[00:37:59] So he won another Navy Cross.
[00:38:03] Less than a month later, he took over the horse Marines.
[00:38:07] Lewis discovered that the 600 man US Marine battalion held only one field exercise each
[00:38:14] week.
[00:38:15] And this was called off in extreme heat or cold or a dust storm.
[00:38:19] But the Japanese did not cancel their training marches for any reason.
[00:38:23] He put his horse Marines through their places daily, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, leaving
[00:38:27] them on long cross country rides with small dust storms boiling in their wake.
[00:38:31] He rode into areas where Japanese were training and effort to observe their details and
[00:38:35] attacked the war.
[00:38:37] We came out and take over and we're just going to tighten things up a little bit.
[00:38:40] One training exercise a month.
[00:38:42] No, daily.
[00:38:43] We're switching to daily.
[00:38:46] Back to the book, Lewis never forgot Virginia Evans.
[00:38:48] That was the girl from the dance and faithfully wrote her his experiences in China.
[00:38:52] In one letter he wrote so emphatically that you can almost see him blurting out the words
[00:38:57] he wanted to hear.
[00:38:59] He wanted to say to her.
[00:39:02] The deer, even if you do marry me and make me a happy man, even then, if I hear the
[00:39:09] beat of the drum, I must leave you.
[00:39:12] I want you to know that.
[00:39:13] Get some.
[00:39:16] She's not even married to him yet.
[00:39:18] She's not even married to him yet.
[00:39:20] And he's like, hey, you know, that's great.
[00:39:22] If you marry me and make me happy man, that's awesome.
[00:39:24] But if I hear the beat of the drum, I'm out.
[00:39:27] I'm going to do what I got to do.
[00:39:32] Here's another.
[00:39:39] He got in trouble.
[00:39:40] He got in trouble a lot because he didn't hold his tongue.
[00:39:44] And you're supposed to hold your tongue, right?
[00:39:48] And he did.
[00:39:49] That's why so many people loved him.
[00:39:51] It's also why he got professional jealousy.
[00:39:53] And it's also why he got in trouble sometimes.
[00:39:56] Here's one example.
[00:39:57] Paul was aware of some American military errors on board the Augusta and he never failed
[00:40:04] to expose them and talks with his with his sentiments.
[00:40:07] Here we have a 10,000 ton heavy cruiser with about 800 men aboard, just one on the
[00:40:14] A'sheatic station.
[00:40:17] The British have three cruisers on duty here.
[00:40:20] You ever notice that we have 37 type writers on this ship?
[00:40:24] The British have just one machine on each of their cruisers.
[00:40:28] Why do you suppose that is?
[00:40:30] You know damn well they don't read all his reports back in Washington when they get there.
[00:40:34] Paperwork will ruin any military force.
[00:40:37] They should have learned that from smedley butler.
[00:40:40] They'll shed this monstrosity when war comes, though, and the fighting people will take
[00:40:45] over.
[00:40:51] So he doesn't like the paperwork, he doesn't like any, and you can see he does the people
[00:40:55] that haven't fought.
[00:40:57] That's where he's just talking about people that don't fight.
[00:40:59] The people that create paperwork because they don't understand how negative and affects
[00:41:05] everyone.
[00:41:06] So they create this stupid paperwork.
[00:41:10] And he ends up going to the basic school, which is like the officer with the officers
[00:41:16] sort of get trained in all the fundamental principles of combat for the Marine Corps.
[00:41:23] And he ended up being instructed there.
[00:41:25] Here we go back to the book.
[00:41:26] This is coming from a guy named Lou Walte.
[00:41:32] Polar was my company commander and to me was the epitome of what the Marine Corps training
[00:41:37] should do.
[00:41:38] Not only in weapons or classroom or field training, he gave us everything hard at every
[00:41:44] break in the field, though he drove us until our tongues were hanging out, men still
[00:41:48] gathered around him.
[00:41:50] He told us tales about fighting in Haiti and Nicaragua, of his patrols living off the land,
[00:41:55] and fighting natives, all his experiences, not just guff.
[00:42:00] Every tale had some point.
[00:42:03] Being under Polar in basic school, did more for me than anything I experienced until I got
[00:42:07] to Guadalcanal.
[00:42:09] He taught us use of terrain like a master, how to use the tiniest bit of covered out
[00:42:14] to our advantage, ground form really meant something when he explained it.
[00:42:18] He taught us to use the bayonet with all the tricks of close-in fighting.
[00:42:22] You couldn't mistake it.
[00:42:24] He knew his stuff cold.
[00:42:26] So again, classic example of when people think, oh, if I'm nicer and I take it easy
[00:42:32] on the truth, they'll like me more.
[00:42:34] Wrong answer.
[00:42:42] Back to the book on a freezing rain swept day just before Polar's marriage, the class of
[00:42:46] 1937 had an uncomfortable experience with him on the drill field.
[00:42:50] They wore nor no overcoats as they marched.
[00:42:54] Teeth chattered, but the ranks moved with precision.
[00:42:57] Lewis saw stray glances at the barracks detachment, which came out for a brief drill, wrapped
[00:43:03] in heavy overcoats and then disappeared.
[00:43:06] Those are barracks Marines.
[00:43:08] He said with an adjunice voice, you're fighting Marines.
[00:43:13] They completed the full schedule for the day, chilled to the bone, and soaking wet.
[00:43:19] So legit.
[00:43:21] That's it's solid yet.
[00:43:27] And he got married.
[00:43:28] And here we go.
[00:43:29] The Polar's left the pleasant life of Philadelphia Navy Yard in the spring of 1939.
[00:43:32] Born for the Orient.
[00:43:33] They had a few days in Hawaii and went to Y.K.
[00:43:37] One morning to ride surfboards with another young friend, Lieutenant Gordon Warner, a champion
[00:43:43] swimmer who had studied under Lewis at the Basics School.
[00:43:47] The two men went out to see a canoe into Virginia's astonishment.
[00:43:50] Lewis rode in with Wagner balancing with his balancing with skill as rollers hurled them
[00:43:56] towards the shore.
[00:43:58] Lewis then returned and rode in on a surfboard alone and turned to Virginia.
[00:44:03] Come on, you're going to try it too.
[00:44:05] You never had so much fun.
[00:44:08] Chester, pull or get in some of that stoke.
[00:44:11] Awesome.
[00:44:13] I just had to bring that out, right?
[00:44:17] Even Chester, pull or like, there's a little bit of stoke.
[00:44:24] Back to the book with a little further delay, Lewis got what he saw from self.
[00:44:27] He would report to the new Marine Base in North Carolina, Swamplands at New River where
[00:44:31] he would command the first Battalion, 7th Marines and prepare them for war.
[00:44:35] So obviously Pearl Harbor takes place and he heads back to the states to take over the
[00:44:39] 1-7 Marines.
[00:44:41] When the Battalion returned from the field late afternoon, Polar called a conference of his
[00:44:47] company officers.
[00:44:49] Gentlemen, my name's Polar.
[00:44:51] Your new commander.
[00:44:52] We have a good deal of work to do together.
[00:44:54] I'll be slow to make changes, but one of them begins tomorrow.
[00:44:58] At the first rest period, after we leave camp, camouflage every man and every piece of equipment.
[00:45:04] We've got no camouflage material major?
[00:45:06] Well, do it anyways.
[00:45:09] The best is in the field.
[00:45:10] Find a mud hole, smear mud on your faces and hands, twigs on helmets and blouses anywhere
[00:45:15] you can stick them.
[00:45:16] Pine foliage is good.
[00:45:17] You'll learn.
[00:45:20] The Battalion began with marches of 12 miles daily.
[00:45:25] This was pushed to 15 and then 20 miles.
[00:45:27] Polar punctuated drills with fight talks to his men.
[00:45:31] They were very young.
[00:45:33] Many them bearded this boys under 16 who must have lied about their ages.
[00:45:37] They were the most obscenely profane men.
[00:45:39] Polar had ever encountered.
[00:45:41] Edward L. Smith, a young battalion doctor, educated at Yale and Harvard, confessed that the
[00:45:46] constant flow of filthy language actually second him.
[00:45:54] Now we had some guys that were marching and some of them followed fall out from the heat.
[00:46:00] And he wrote it and the major polaroid comes by.
[00:46:03] When you were marching this morning, I heard a marine on the roadside say, there goes
[00:46:07] the goddamn seventh regiment.
[00:46:10] I was amazed when you didn't step out of ranks and knock him out cold.
[00:46:18] One of his private's Gerald White, a Yale man from Eastport, Maine, also a direst began
[00:46:23] to take note of Polar.
[00:46:26] He is never obscene, remarkably for the vigor with which he handles us.
[00:46:30] He is tough and demands the utmost.
[00:46:33] But there is always a kindly approach even when he is chewing you out the displays
[00:46:37] of touching sympathy.
[00:46:40] Again, this is what we are trying to do as leaders.
[00:46:44] Balance that dichotomy.
[00:46:50] Here's Polar talking to his troops.
[00:46:53] One more thing, whenever we are at Chow, the privates will be fed first, then the non-combs
[00:47:00] and officers last of all.
[00:47:03] Typical, taking care of the troops.
[00:47:06] And they were tough into that.
[00:47:08] Oh, this is it when they are doing calistenics in all their marches.
[00:47:16] And here we go back to the book.
[00:47:18] When they were tough into that, Polar put them through a series of night marches, beginning
[00:47:21] after midnight.
[00:47:22] The doctors like others learned to read maps and compasses and to handle weapons, including
[00:47:26] mortars.
[00:47:27] The practice of identifying ships and planes, a joke in most units became a serious business
[00:47:32] in 17, some medics learned Morris code.
[00:47:35] The Manila John Basilone, an army-trained veteran machine gunner, traded semifur lessons
[00:47:40] for instruction in first aid.
[00:47:45] Had to bring out the Manila John.
[00:47:47] It's like unbelievable man, that this story is just unbelievable.
[00:47:55] Here's another very cool situation.
[00:48:00] This young lieutenant was practicing some kind of an assault and he gets a little complicated
[00:48:06] and Polar calls everyone as old man.
[00:48:10] Whether they're old and him or younger, he calls everyone old man, which is pretty funny.
[00:48:13] So here we go.
[00:48:14] Polar's talking to this young lieutenant.
[00:48:15] Old man, there's mighty little room for fancy tactics below division level.
[00:48:20] The enemy are on the hill.
[00:48:21] You go get him.
[00:48:22] In the end, you'll save men.
[00:48:24] There are times when you'll have to flank, but don't forget that the shortest distance
[00:48:27] between two points is a straight line.
[00:48:31] Get some.
[00:48:35] I always talk about flanking.
[00:48:38] I'm a big believer.
[00:48:40] Jesse Polar says, hey, sometimes you got a flank, but sometimes you gotta go get some straight
[00:48:44] line.
[00:48:47] Here's another important thing.
[00:48:49] There's a kernel that's running artillery training and he goes and talks to him.
[00:48:53] Colonel, you'll be starting artillery training next week.
[00:48:55] I want you to let me know when you'll fire.
[00:48:58] I want to get my troops under it as often as I can.
[00:49:02] And the Colonel said, there may be accidents.
[00:49:06] And Polar says, we can chance those.
[00:49:07] What I won't chance is taking a bunch of green kids to war before they know the sound
[00:49:12] of big guns.
[00:49:13] I know shells aren't the same going in and coming out, but this will help.
[00:49:20] So he wanted to get them right there under the sound of the guns.
[00:49:25] Lieutenant Cox, now the executive of A company, was impressed by Polar's thoroughness.
[00:49:33] Major Polar never stood aside and said carry on sergeant and most of other officers did.
[00:49:39] He was in there with us packing all.
[00:49:41] He could walk down the best of us, even the kids.
[00:49:44] Other commanders rode cars in the woods, but not Polar.
[00:49:54] Here's another journal entry.
[00:49:56] Private Gerald White wrote for his diary, Polar must have marched twice the distance we
[00:50:00] did.
[00:50:01] For all day long, he kept marching up and down the column, Johnty as a Bantam Rooster, pipe
[00:50:05] clenched in his teeth, ever alert to see that men who were succumbing to the heat, exhaustion
[00:50:11] or blisters were taken care of by corpsmen.
[00:50:14] Many times today, I saw him take a bar, which is a Browning automatic rifle, a big
[00:50:18] machine gun, a bar, machine gun, or mortar off the shoulder of some marine whose fan he
[00:50:23] was dragging and carry it to give the poor guy some respite.
[00:50:30] Here's another situation again, good dichotomy here.
[00:50:34] Somebody, he finds somebody asleep on watch, which by the way, is like incredibly horrible
[00:50:40] thing which you can get severely punished for.
[00:50:43] Back to the book, Polar shook the boy awake.
[00:50:44] Old man, it's dangerous to pull a trick like this.
[00:50:48] Suppose Captain Rogers had caught you.
[00:50:50] He'd made a big fuss and then I'd have to court marshal you and slap you into the
[00:50:53] brick.
[00:50:54] Maybe that's what I should do, but I'll give you another chance.
[00:50:58] Pretty soon, now we'll be fighting for keeps and you'll stay awake or risk the lives
[00:51:04] of every one of us.
[00:51:05] You understand me?
[00:51:07] So I mean, talk about it way to endure yourself to the troops.
[00:51:11] That's so awesome.
[00:51:13] Hey, if the Captain would have caught you, then would have been a big fuss.
[00:51:18] Luckily I caught you.
[00:51:21] Polar was, so they, they deploy overseas.
[00:51:24] Polar was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel on Samoa.
[00:51:28] He wrote to his wife, life is so short.
[00:51:33] When I was a child, I thought it would last forever, never.
[00:51:37] My love for you will Virginia, even into the next life and then on.
[00:51:41] The hardest thing that I've ever done was tell you goodbye.
[00:51:44] That was a black Tuesday and I pray that will never be another separation.
[00:51:49] Yeah, you're not right.
[00:51:54] You know, they're going, they're heading into a gaudal canal.
[00:51:57] So that's going to make everyone think life can get pretty short.
[00:52:03] Back to the book, Fire came from the Seaward Japanese ship stood close in, unchallenged
[00:52:07] and battered the area.
[00:52:08] Much of the grove was combed by flying fragments and men screamed in agony.
[00:52:12] These were torn and broken and many tumble to the ground.
[00:52:18] People reported hearing general polar or at this time Colonel polar.
[00:52:22] It's all right, men.
[00:52:23] Stayed down and they can't hurt you.
[00:52:25] This one last forever tomorrow will be our turn.
[00:52:28] So they're just getting, they landed on the beach and they're just getting hammered with
[00:52:35] a jab from Japanese ships, big artillery from the big naval guns.
[00:52:41] The battalion left that left the perimeter that afternoon, a file of more than 800 men.
[00:52:47] The tail of the battalion had hardly cleared the perimeter when they were firing ahead.
[00:52:51] Captain Hayes was near the Colonel at the moment.
[00:52:54] Every man hit the deck except polar.
[00:52:58] We dive for the growth beside the trail, but he walked up and down the line, talking
[00:53:01] is if he were on parade.
[00:53:03] He told us it was all right and this was nothing to worry about just small stuff.
[00:53:07] We began to get up again.
[00:53:09] Then in there he commanded that battalion as it never imagined it could be commanded.
[00:53:15] The men saw what kind of man they had and the word went down the column as fast as light.
[00:53:21] We lost our fear or some of it.
[00:53:26] On a grassy null above the tangle where the night's bivouac was planned, the column
[00:53:31] met an ambush, two bobhaggries, platoon were killed, two bobhaggries, platoon were killed,
[00:53:38] and the unit broken to tiny groups leaving Haggry without a command.
[00:53:42] He lane-covered and watched polar.
[00:53:44] It was the greatest exhibition of utter disregard for personal safety I ever saw.
[00:53:55] He definitely, like I said, whatever that officer was in Haiti that told them don't show
[00:54:02] fear under fire, he took that one to the bank.
[00:54:07] Back to the book, a runner just began jumping around just from different combat scenarios.
[00:54:12] A runner just behind polar was hit in the throat and died quickly.
[00:54:15] Everyone else hit the ground except for Colonel Polar.
[00:54:18] First Sergeant William Pennington retained a vivid memory of the moment.
[00:54:21] Colonel stood there in that grazing fire with that little old stump of a pipe in his face,
[00:54:25] yelling B company second-pultoon in line here.
[00:54:28] Machine gun fire kicked up dust all around me and I stayed down in that knee high-cune
[00:54:32] I grass like everyone else in the ranks.
[00:54:35] He was the only Marine you could see standing on that hillside.
[00:54:41] Get this.
[00:54:42] Here we go.
[00:54:43] A grenade fell near the old man.
[00:54:46] No more than eight yards away.
[00:54:48] Nothing Captain Zach Cox estimated, but Polar turned when he saw a company scatter and
[00:54:54] yelled, oh that damn thing ain't going off.
[00:54:59] It helped the steady the men.
[00:55:01] The grenade was a dud.
[00:55:05] Yeah.
[00:55:09] So they get done.
[00:55:10] They're kind of like a situation.
[00:55:13] First few days of fighting back the book.
[00:55:15] Polar's battalion had 24 dead and 23 wounded.
[00:55:18] The next day back in the main defense line of the perimeter he called together the
[00:55:23] battalion officers.
[00:55:24] His voice was hard and his face unsmiling.
[00:55:28] Gentlemen, at least we've all been blooded now.
[00:55:31] I don't want you to be moaning over our losses and feeling sorry for yourselves or taking
[00:55:35] all the blame on your shoulders.
[00:55:38] We've all got to leave this world someday.
[00:55:41] We're all in the same pickle.
[00:55:43] And there are worse things than dying for your country.
[00:55:46] Some things about our action in the last four days I want you to remember forever.
[00:55:50] There are some we'd all like to forget, but they'll be in your mind's eye as long as you live.
[00:55:57] I hope we've all learned something.
[00:55:59] Now take care of your men and make yourselves ready.
[00:56:02] We haven't seen anything yet.
[00:56:06] One other thing, back there on the hillside at Mount Austin, I had trouble getting company
[00:56:10] officers up.
[00:56:12] I hope you saw that cost us casualties.
[00:56:15] Never do I want to see that again in my command.
[00:56:18] I want to see officers leading.
[00:56:21] I want you to know that your leaders and not simply commanders.
[00:56:24] You cannot operate a military force in the field under these conditions with commanders alone.
[00:56:31] Civilians wouldn't know what I was talking about, but you've found out now that it's true.
[00:56:35] There aren't many qualities in a man, but one that is absolutely necessary in an infantry
[00:56:39] leader is stark courage.
[00:56:41] Give that idea to your men in your own way.
[00:56:46] Don't worry over the things that are done that we can no longer help.
[00:56:50] Concentrate on building a better combat unit because that's the best hope of all of us surviving.
[00:56:57] None of us could help the fact that I was the only combat trained man in our outfit when
[00:57:00] we began.
[00:57:01] I was lucky enough to get the joke when I was young.
[00:57:05] You'll come along fast and they'll be worked for us.
[00:57:08] That's be ready when our time comes.
[00:57:14] Yeah, that's, that's, I haven't really heard that point, but you know what you knew here
[00:57:18] people talk about leaders and managers and I've worked with companies and it's a good,
[00:57:24] a good sentiment, right?
[00:57:25] Hey, our leaders are leaders, our leaders are leaders.
[00:57:28] They're not managers.
[00:57:29] Well, this is an interesting one of saying, look, it's not commanders.
[00:57:33] Leaders, not commanders.
[00:57:34] Yeah.
[00:57:35] And if you think about the difference between commanders, me and I'm going to command you.
[00:57:37] You know, leaders are going to lead.
[00:57:39] The very, very cool distinction between those two words.
[00:57:48] Back to the book, he still missed nothing involving the morale of his men.
[00:57:52] Reagan Fuller, who began to feel the stark drama of the situation after the first severe
[00:57:56] fight grew a beard and swaggered around the perimeter like a desparado.
[00:58:01] Puller took him aside.
[00:58:03] Oh, man, you're carried away with this war business.
[00:58:06] You're feeling too self-important about it.
[00:58:07] That's dangerous.
[00:58:09] This is just a matter of killer be killed.
[00:58:12] I got to read that again.
[00:58:14] This is just a matter of kill or be killed.
[00:58:18] And we've got to stay on our toes to have a chance.
[00:58:22] Clean yourself up.
[00:58:23] Here's some shaving gear.
[00:58:24] And when you're through, you can take a drink from that bottle if you like.
[00:58:32] Again, connecting with your troops and recognizing that a guy is starting to go sideways
[00:58:40] a little bit and pulling him aside and talking to him.
[00:58:45] All right.
[00:58:46] Now, again, they're just engaged in a fierce battle at this point back to the book at
[00:58:51] the peak of this.
[00:58:52] Pollard had a telephone call from the regimental commander in the rear.
[00:58:55] Pollard, we've got to change in orders.
[00:58:57] Execute the reconnaissance and force with your battalion along the coast road.
[00:59:01] Do not become involved in a large action.
[00:59:04] Be prepared to withdraw to maintain communications.
[00:59:07] Reagan Fuller was within the air shot of Polar.
[00:59:10] As Polar shouted in rage, how the hell can I make a reconnaissance when we're engaged
[00:59:14] down to the last man?
[00:59:15] We're fighting tooth and nail man.
[00:59:17] If you'd get off your duff and come up here where the fighting is, you could see the situation.
[00:59:26] Boom.
[00:59:27] Again, this is why he wasn't always super popular up the chain of
[00:59:31] command because he spoke the truth.
[00:59:36] Sometimes in the most, not the most tactful way.
[00:59:41] Now, Polar's battalion actually ends up getting the upper hand there and he gets them
[00:59:47] kind of pinned down in crushes.
[00:59:53] Back to the book.
[00:59:54] When it was over, the regimental headquarters called back, relieving Polar of any necessity
[00:59:57] of a reconnaissance patrol and permitting him to return to the perimeter.
[01:00:01] There was also a call from Hanukkah and a request to bring back his wounded.
[01:00:06] Polar's men carried in all casualties from the two battalions.
[01:00:10] Two battalions.
[01:00:11] Polar's battalion had five dead and 21 wounded.
[01:00:14] Total losses were 65 dead and 125 wounded for the operation.
[01:00:18] Polar estimated that the enemy losses to be at least five times that.
[01:00:23] And it was later revealed that the Japanese fourth infantry had lost almost an entire battalion
[01:00:27] with 690 dead, the result of Polar's strike in the crater.
[01:00:34] Now, like I said, he speaks his mind and remember, I mentioned Colonel Vandagreff, who
[01:00:43] he worked for when he was a young lieutenant.
[01:00:44] Well, now Colonel Vandagreff is a general and general Vandagreff, they're having a little
[01:00:49] conversation.
[01:00:51] Back to the book, the whole process was assinined.
[01:00:54] They mixed up outfits as badly as they possibly could.
[01:00:58] There was no overall commander.
[01:01:00] Division gave orders to Hanukkah and Wailing and Me.
[01:01:04] Wailing was senior, but orders did not come through him.
[01:01:06] My regimental commander was behind the river and not on scene.
[01:01:09] Thus, when they found two battalions stopped cold in the fight, communications were so
[01:01:13] bad they pulled these two outfits and left me to face all the enemy.
[01:01:17] We were blind lucky to come out as we did.
[01:01:19] Imagine them ordering me to go on some damn reconnaissance when I was fighting with every
[01:01:24] man I had.
[01:01:25] Proper designation of authority would have made everything clear.
[01:01:29] Boom.
[01:01:30] There you go.
[01:01:33] Proper designation of authority.
[01:01:36] People need to know who's in charge.
[01:01:37] And you need to put someone in charge.
[01:01:39] That's the way it's got to work.
[01:01:42] When you don't have that, you get confused and you get issues.
[01:01:45] Now there's like a field doctor there.
[01:01:50] Dr. Smith noted in his diary that Polar seemed more concerned over losses.
[01:01:55] He has become almost fanatical in his desire to see that men are properly cared for.
[01:01:59] If a man's body is lost, he is greatly disturbed and frets about the time lost before
[01:02:03] he can recover the body and give it a decent burial.
[01:02:10] There you go.
[01:02:13] There was one unpleasant matter.
[01:02:16] The young Philadelphia who had earlier been a disciplinary problem on Samoa had failed
[01:02:20] the Colonel on the crater march.
[01:02:22] Polar called Jim Hayes the legal officer.
[01:02:24] I want you to have her tried for dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy.
[01:02:28] He threw away his load of mortar shells because it was too heavy and he cost me the lives
[01:02:32] of several men damn his time.
[01:02:35] I'll draw a recommendation.
[01:02:37] I'm going to have him shot.
[01:02:42] I don't think I covered it.
[01:02:48] The reason I pointed that out is because that guy redeems himself in the future.
[01:02:53] It's one of the times where Polar says, okay, you're good.
[01:02:58] He does some incredibly brave and crazy things.
[01:03:01] Here we go back to the book.
[01:03:04] The major Japanese attack was expected along the mat and cow in most of the division strength
[01:03:14] was placed there.
[01:03:15] The Japanese move to attack these positions on October 15th with the second division,
[01:03:22] assigned to swing far inland and hit the Marines from the south in an area where Polar's
[01:03:26] men awaited.
[01:03:27] Nine infantry battalion set out on this march total of 5,600 men excluding artillery
[01:03:32] and other support troops.
[01:03:33] The soldiers carried or dragged everything, even guns over the rough trails.
[01:03:37] They were late in making their attack and abandoned many guns on the trail.
[01:03:40] So the Japanese are coming in there, coming aggressively.
[01:03:45] A company was weaker by one platoon than the other companies for despite protests of
[01:03:50] Conner Polar.
[01:03:51] There was an outpost of 46 of its men, some 3,000 yards to their front, commanded by
[01:03:57] Sergeant Ralph Briggs Jr., a fort Edward's Wisconsin.
[01:04:01] These men have been out for several days to warn of an enemy approach.
[01:04:04] Colonel Polar was on the field phone during the day of digging in, trying to persuade
[01:04:08] his regimental commander to have headquarters with draw, bricks and his patrol.
[01:04:12] But going to sacrifice those men, that's all.
[01:04:15] We don't need any bait on the hook as you say.
[01:04:17] If they're coming, they're coming.
[01:04:19] This is foolishness to throw away that platoon and they do a great job in the mini-series,
[01:04:24] the Pacific of kind of showing this.
[01:04:27] And if you ever watch the Pacific, I mean, just watch it, watch it about 10 times.
[01:04:31] I've probably watched it in 20 times.
[01:04:35] And he tries to keep them as safe as he can.
[01:04:39] Back to the book.
[01:04:40] All righty said, let's get this straight.
[01:04:41] Hold your hold fire until you get an order for me.
[01:04:44] The outpost must get clear before we open up.
[01:04:46] If the bastard's breakthrough, use the bayonet and keep someone at every phone.
[01:04:51] Wait.
[01:04:52] Puller looked at his watch. It was 10 o'clock. Yells rolled from the right.
[01:04:57] Japanese voices shouting in English, blood for the emperor.
[01:05:01] Marine you die.
[01:05:02] A Marine bellowed back to hell with your goddamn emperor.
[01:05:09] Sergeant Manila John Boselon's nest of guns is about the center of sea company in the
[01:05:13] middle of the line with a slight decline in his front.
[01:05:16] The enemy drove toward him so persistently that he covered the hill with their bodies.
[01:05:21] And when the first fury of attack faded, he sent men to push down the wall of enemy bodies
[01:05:27] to clear the fire lane.
[01:05:32] Of course, that's John Baselon who is awarded the Medal of Honor for those actions that
[01:05:36] night.
[01:05:39] Now there's a artillery commander, a little bit to the rear named Devol.
[01:05:46] And Polar is asking Devol for massive artillery support because they're like going to
[01:05:52] be overrun.
[01:05:53] Polar called the Valle again, give us all you've got.
[01:05:56] We're holding on by our toenails.
[01:05:57] I'll give you all you call for Polar, but God knows what will happen when this ammo we
[01:06:01] have is gone.
[01:06:03] If we don't need it now, we'll never need it.
[01:06:05] If they get through here tonight, there won't be a tomorrow.
[01:06:10] That's a situation that they were in.
[01:06:12] They can follow or call from the CP from the flank, Colonel, I'm just about running out of
[01:06:16] ammo.
[01:06:17] I've used almost three and a half units of fire.
[01:06:20] You got bayonets, haven't you?
[01:06:21] Fuller?
[01:06:22] Sure.
[01:06:23] Yes, sir.
[01:06:24] All right, then.
[01:06:25] Hang on.
[01:06:26] And the heaviest of the firing when Polar left the CP, Regimental headquarters called for
[01:06:32] him.
[01:06:33] Not here, sir, the wireman said.
[01:06:34] Colonel Polar's up front.
[01:06:36] Find him, get him on the phone.
[01:06:37] After the crew had made several calls to the line position, Polar returned and talked to
[01:06:41] Regimental Commander, the few remaining in the pit heard Polar's explosive reply.
[01:06:46] What do you mean what's going on?
[01:06:47] We're neck deep in a firefight and have no time standing here, bull flinging.
[01:06:51] If you want to find out what's going on, come up and see.
[01:07:00] He was that good.
[01:07:03] He was that good.
[01:07:04] That he was able to do that.
[01:07:07] You know, it's kind of like when Remo and I was talking about Steve Jobs, a couple podcasts
[01:07:11] going on.
[01:07:12] I was like, hey, look, he was a, he was not a good leader.
[01:07:14] He was abusive and he was, but he was so good at his other skills.
[01:07:18] Well, he, Polar's such a great leader down the chain of command.
[01:07:22] And he's such a great tactician and he's so brave and so, do, do dominant on the battlefield.
[01:07:28] Then he does this stuff and like basically gets away with it.
[01:07:31] Yeah.
[01:07:32] Yeah.
[01:07:33] Back to the book.
[01:07:36] There was one enemy prisoner, a little sullen war officer who refused to talk when
[01:07:41] he was brought to Polar.
[01:07:42] The Colonel was so stung by the insolence of the prisoner that he slapped him with a flat
[01:07:47] end of an entrenching tool.
[01:07:49] Teeth spilled from the Japs mouth, but they were false teeth.
[01:07:51] He gave no information, even then.
[01:07:54] A later prisoner talked freely with Polar and Polar asked him, why didn't you change your
[01:08:01] tactics when you saw you weren't breaking our line?
[01:08:03] Why didn't you shift to a weaker spot?
[01:08:06] That is not the Japanese way.
[01:08:08] The plan had been made.
[01:08:09] No one would have dared to change it.
[01:08:12] It must go as it is written.
[01:08:15] That's why we have decentralized commands.
[01:08:19] That's the opposite of decentralized command.
[01:08:21] That's called centralized command.
[01:08:22] Here's the plan.
[01:08:23] This is what you will execute.
[01:08:24] Don't do anything different.
[01:08:30] Back to the book.
[01:08:31] And this is kind of after this thing settled down.
[01:08:33] That's why they have prisoners.
[01:08:34] That's why he's doing interrogation.
[01:08:35] That's why he's asking why didn't you change your tactics when you broke the line.
[01:08:39] Back to the book.
[01:08:40] Polars, Polars men found 250 Japanese dead inside their lines during the day.
[01:08:44] About 25 of them officers who want to major who had committed suicide, leaving a final entry
[01:08:49] in his diary on the loss of his colors and troops.
[01:08:53] I do not know what excuse to give.
[01:08:55] I apologize for what I have done.
[01:08:57] I am going to return my borrowed life today with short interest.
[01:09:01] Yeah, I thought that that was worth bringing up because you always hear about the fanaticism
[01:09:07] of the Japanese, but there you go.
[01:09:09] That's it.
[01:09:10] I apologize.
[01:09:12] And I'm going to kill myself because I didn't succeed in my mission.
[01:09:18] Polars casualties for the battle were 1930 wounded and 12 missing.
[01:09:23] Two or three days later when the stench of bloated bodies in his front made his men
[01:09:29] wretch, Polar persuaded division to make count of the enemy casualties and bury the corpses.
[01:09:35] This burial detail counted 1,462 bodies and spent two days in the grizzly work.
[01:09:42] Bulldozers, ground, gouge holes and covered the enemy dead in great pits.
[01:09:47] So that's incredible.
[01:09:50] Incredible.
[01:09:51] That killed ratio.
[01:09:56] The Colonel washed in the river with the troops and Reagan Fuller noticed that even
[01:10:01] when he washed his uniforms, he stripped with the enlisted men in the river.
[01:10:05] A common touch the men liked Fuller said, though a few of the clouds were its type officers
[01:10:10] in the rear-ranked Snickard behind his back, the men knew he was real.
[01:10:14] That he never put on an act and they loved him.
[01:10:22] And again, here's the dichotomy of it.
[01:10:24] We know what a hard ass he is.
[01:10:27] Back to the book, Polar Shield is shielded as men from unnecessary work.
[01:10:31] A young officer who insisted that they police up the batagon area, removing jab beer cans
[01:10:36] and the debris of the battle was stopped by the Colonel.
[01:10:40] Forget it old man.
[01:10:41] Let the boys get in their sacks and leave them the hell alone.
[01:10:44] They're half dead from fever and fighting and they'll have to hop to it again any day now.
[01:10:50] So there you go.
[01:10:51] That's the act like he just nails that he's perfect.
[01:10:59] Another situation, Polar was 300 to 400 yards behind the point of his column.
[01:11:04] The first salvo of Japanese fire burst just in front of him.
[01:11:08] For the first time in his combat career, spanning 23 years, his luck ran out under enemy
[01:11:13] fire.
[01:11:14] He was blown from his feet by a spray of flying metal.
[01:11:17] Michelle fragments his torn his legs and lower body and he was bleeding freely.
[01:11:22] The field telephone was carried by a Marine just in his rear.
[01:11:26] Call had quarters old man.
[01:11:28] Polar said, I can't serve the wires been cut.
[01:11:31] The Colonel struggled unsteadily to his feet and tried to help the communications man repair
[01:11:35] the wire.
[01:11:37] As he stood an enemy sniper shot, an enemy sniper shot him twice through the flesh
[01:11:41] of his arm with a small caliber bullets.
[01:11:43] He sank back to the ground.
[01:11:46] The target, pending to him, come up by now and he helped Shepard lift Polar into a
[01:11:50] poncho and get him off the ground to avoid tetanus infection.
[01:11:55] Shepard bent over Polar.
[01:11:57] Are you able to stay in command sir?
[01:11:58] Yes, of course I am.
[01:12:00] I'll be okay.
[01:12:01] I can't leave these men.
[01:12:03] May I call for artillery fire if I can get ready or phone working?
[01:12:06] Yes, if you know how.
[01:12:08] Men shoveled out a fox hole for Polar and lowered him into the poncho.
[01:12:14] The telephone is placed in the hole with him and when the line was repaired he cradled
[01:12:17] the phone in one arm and talked to headquarters.
[01:12:20] Pendington listened as he discussed a mortar barrage across the river the next morning
[01:12:24] and the launching of a dawn attack.
[01:12:28] He's all shot up and blown up and he's planning an attack for the morning.
[01:12:32] Shepard called in the artillery fire, shell soon burst in the thick it's across the
[01:12:35] stream and the enemy was quiet for the rest of that evening.
[01:12:39] Late in the night Polar realized that he could no longer walk and call division headquarters.
[01:12:45] I find myself unable to proceed by leading my troops.
[01:12:49] He said after the delay word came back, Major John C. Weber will assume command of your
[01:12:54] battalion within a few hours.
[01:12:56] He is leaving the perimeter immediately.
[01:13:03] So that was, you know, he gets pulled out, going back to the book, Lieutenant Colonel Polar
[01:13:12] is being recommended by General Vandagriff for the Medal of Honor for leading his battalion
[01:13:17] with seven holes in him continually for 24 hours.
[01:13:21] It's a good recommended for the Medal of Honor.
[01:13:24] This did not develop at the Division Commander in addition to commanding Polar's battalion
[01:13:28] for its perimeter defense and putting in for a third Navy cross for its commander also
[01:13:33] to run.
[01:13:34] I have known Lewis Polar since 1919.
[01:13:36] He was one of the best combat patrol officers I knew, just as he is in an outstanding officer
[01:13:41] today.
[01:13:42] He did a wonderful job with his battalion on Guadal Canal and every phase in the operation.
[01:13:46] I am as proud to have him as a friend, as I was glad to have him as a Marine.
[01:13:55] January 1st 1943 was warm and sunny and the loading went smoothly.
[01:14:00] The gear was all stowed in the last of the first Marine Division troops were going aboard.
[01:14:05] It was only then that their condition became apparent, men who had fought for four months
[01:14:09] in the foulest climate in the Pacific and had been sheldon bombed or shot up by snipers
[01:14:14] almost constantly between battles seemed to collapse at the same moment.
[01:14:19] Scores were unable to climb the nets into the ships and had to be carried aboard.
[01:14:23] They had shocked expressions with glazed sunken eyes.
[01:14:28] For weeks, most of them would be patients with malaria, dysentery, assorted fevers and fungus
[01:14:34] infections.
[01:14:35] Virtually, every man in the Division had malaria by now.
[01:14:39] Polar said it isn't so much that their sick are even worn out.
[01:14:43] It's the reaction from the discovery that they're finally leaving this damn place and yet
[01:14:48] a lot of them grew into men here.
[01:14:51] The Division's dead were 1,242 and 2,655 had been wounded.
[01:14:59] Sickness was near total.
[01:15:01] No one could yet grasp the importance of the island fighting on the day of loading out.
[01:15:05] The longest of the Pacific island campaigns had been fought and the pattern of future victories
[01:15:10] had been set.
[01:15:11] The Japanese had paid a higher price here than they would pay again and had thrown all their
[01:15:16] disposal.
[01:15:17] The ships, planes, men and machines.
[01:15:22] More than 50,000 men had been lost on the island or on the ships trying to reach it.
[01:15:27] In Japan it was already known as the island of death.
[01:15:32] For more than a year radio Tokyo was to call the First Marine Division the Guadalcanal
[01:15:39] butchers.
[01:15:45] So that's Guadalcanal.
[01:15:49] He actually heads home and here we go back to the book.
[01:15:56] An aide in the office in Washington.
[01:16:00] General Thomas Holcomb jolted in with the news.
[01:16:02] The general's given you to the army, Polar.
[01:16:05] I mean all alone.
[01:16:06] For three or four months General Marshall wants you to explain the Guadalcanal fighting
[01:16:10] to his troops all over the country.
[01:16:13] You needn't fret about leaving your men.
[01:16:14] The division will be in Australia for the next six months before we can get back into
[01:16:17] action.
[01:16:18] I expect you'll rejoin it in time for another big show.
[01:16:23] So there's time between these big island campaigns and he goes home to America to take
[01:16:28] over or spread the word about what the fighting was like.
[01:16:33] Back to the book.
[01:16:34] He often spoke three times daily.
[01:16:35] He was on and off planes until he all but lost track of his route.
[01:16:38] He told the story of his fight for the perimeter of Baz alone pushing the wall of enemy
[01:16:42] bodies down the hill of burials by bulldozer and of weapons they used.
[01:16:47] He told of patrols and thick growth but never of his wounds.
[01:16:53] I can't tell you the japs are no damn good he said because they are good.
[01:16:57] But we're better.
[01:16:59] One American properly trained can handle two of the yellow bastards.
[01:17:04] They have discipline and they use the jungle cover better than we do but they can't think
[01:17:08] on their own.
[01:17:09] That's a critical dichotomy.
[01:17:22] The discipline which obviously is something that I am passionate about.
[01:17:29] But if you put so much discipline in two much discipline in place people don't think
[01:17:32] for themselves anymore.
[01:17:34] They just wait.
[01:17:38] They never change battle plans once they're made regardless of costs.
[01:17:42] They think they lose face.
[01:17:43] They have no artillery compared with ours and our guns chew them to pieces.
[01:17:47] They get the jungle rot just as much as we do.
[01:17:50] They're not superman and will whip the hell out of them and you'll be helping to do it
[01:17:54] soon I suppose.
[01:17:56] If you take your training seriously then there's nothing to worry about.
[01:17:59] But you'll have to be hard and you can be hard when you write with your families.
[01:18:05] You try to convince them that we're in a war to the finish and that all these strikes
[01:18:10] and softness and confusion will have to go.
[01:18:14] I can tell you one more thing.
[01:18:16] There are worse things than dying for your country.
[01:18:22] When you spoke to the war production board officials in Washington here's what he said.
[01:18:25] I want to ask you why American troops shouldn't have the best.
[01:18:28] The world's best fighting equipment.
[01:18:29] On Guadalcan now we saw our trenching shovels break at first use.
[01:18:33] All from men now have jab shovels because they're better and more dependable.
[01:18:37] Jab field glasses are better too.
[01:18:40] I have good ones myself, German glasses that I've carried for 20 years.
[01:18:43] Why should American glasses be so poor?
[01:18:45] Not worth the damn in the tropics.
[01:18:47] They fog up and they are improperly sealed.
[01:18:50] Once they get damped they're done for.
[01:18:51] I've seen hundreds of pairs tossed away in the jungle or sea because men know they can
[01:18:56] see as well with the naked eye.
[01:18:58] What kind of American ingenuity or patriotism produce those?
[01:19:04] He doesn't play.
[01:19:06] This is a little part about humility.
[01:19:10] We'll have to get over the idea that where the greatest people on earth and every respect,
[01:19:13] that we're infalible and that no one else has ideas worth considering.
[01:19:18] One of the reasons we had to fight against the odds on Guadalcan now was this insufferable
[01:19:23] American notion of superiority and our carelessness in the face of danger.
[01:19:28] It goes back to Pearl Harbor and far beyond.
[01:19:30] He said, you got to stay humble.
[01:19:33] He can't be arrogant.
[01:19:37] He was summoned before the high command of the Marine Corps and gave the same fourth
[01:19:42] right picture of the fighting he had seen.
[01:19:46] Gentlemen, we have some of the same old troubles.
[01:19:49] Staff officers who've never seen combat issue unrealistic orders that cost lives
[01:19:53] time, money and ruin morale.
[01:19:57] For example, we were out there on that island trying to defend a perimeter when they
[01:20:02] wanted to send a patrol outside the command never used a single regiment but sent out three
[01:20:07] mixed battalions.
[01:20:09] The logical thing would have been a regular regiment with one battalion leading the
[01:20:12] other and the other two covering.
[01:20:15] Officers and men would be familiar with each other and there would never be questions
[01:20:18] about who is in command.
[01:20:21] When we did go out, it was almost always with mixed battalions.
[01:20:25] It may look good in the staff officers chart here at headquarters but it didn't work.
[01:20:30] Brought us only stumbling and confusing and casualties.
[01:20:34] More than once, we were out in the jungle, nobody really knew who is in command.
[01:20:39] I could cite you the names of many a man I lost because of that.
[01:20:42] It was inexcusable.
[01:20:43] This is something that it absolutely is very important to understand, especially for
[01:20:49] guys that are, I guess anybody.
[01:20:52] You work in your train in a certain way.
[01:20:55] As much as you can, stay in the groups that you work in train with.
[01:21:01] For them to just randomly, who knows why they did this, but I'll tell you what I've seen.
[01:21:06] I've seen this where let's say there's some operation.
[01:21:12] That's a high visibility operation that everyone thinks, wow, that'd be a cool operation
[01:21:16] to do.
[01:21:18] Instead of just taking, let's say, one company, they go, okay, well, we want to get multiple
[01:21:25] different people to get to be able to be involved in this operation.
[01:21:28] So, take one, one, put two in from this company, one put two in from this other company,
[01:21:32] and we'll just send them all out there.
[01:21:35] That's exactly what he's talking about.
[01:21:36] No, no, hey, sorry, you guys aren't going to go on this operation.
[01:21:41] We're sending an alpha company or a bravo company or whatever.
[01:21:44] That's the way you do it.
[01:21:46] Play around.
[01:21:47] Here's a little comment because I love machine guns.
[01:21:57] A little comment on the art of machine gunnery.
[01:21:59] These guns are the most important firepower to infantry.
[01:22:05] I'm just making that statement.
[01:22:07] Cool.
[01:22:08] Tested, chesty-polar.
[01:22:09] Statement.
[01:22:10] Machine guns go be a machine gunner.
[01:22:18] You know what I'm saying?
[01:22:19] I know, I was so fired up one day, we were at the gym and I walked in.
[01:22:22] There was some kid was signing up and he was, no, I call him a kid.
[01:22:27] He was probably, oh man, 24 years old, yeah.
[01:22:29] And so I said, hey, oh man, no, I think, I said, you know, I could tell, yeah, like
[01:22:36] a high-intite.
[01:22:37] I was like, oh, are you in military?
[01:22:38] He goes, yeah, I'm in the Marine Corps.
[01:22:40] I said, what are you doing the Marine Corps?
[01:22:42] He said, machine gunner.
[01:22:44] Dig it.
[01:22:45] S.
[01:22:46] Awesome.
[01:22:48] All right.
[01:22:50] Here's another comment.
[01:22:57] We just don't know all we ought to know about warfare on land or sea.
[01:23:02] Just off-Grawl Channel, not long ago, we lost three cruises.
[01:23:05] Cruisers blasted down by jab guns as they sat there, sitting ducks, that's all.
[01:23:09] I'll tell you exactly why we lost him.
[01:23:11] The Admiral and Charred got a plane report that the jab force was approaching at 14 knots
[01:23:15] by daylight.
[01:23:16] So we figured at this speed the enemy couldn't arrive in his waters before the next
[01:23:20] dawn.
[01:23:21] After dark, of course, the jab stepped up through speed to 28 knots and got to the
[01:23:26] scene at 3 a.m. when our men were not even at battle stations.
[01:23:30] Instead of keeping, it happened like that.
[01:23:33] I'm positive.
[01:23:34] And instead of keeping such thing secret, we ought to have them emblazoned on the
[01:23:38] gate at every naval station.
[01:23:41] We must not be too proud or too stupid to profit by armistakes.
[01:23:48] And God knows that we make them.
[01:23:50] Have you ever heard the term profit from armistakes before?
[01:23:52] No, but I really like it.
[01:23:54] Yeah, I think I really like it too.
[01:23:56] Why not?
[01:23:58] Profit from your mistakes.
[01:24:00] It's brilliant.
[01:24:01] Yeah, kind of puts it more into, you know, they say, learn from your mistakes, right?
[01:24:05] Yeah, they learn cool.
[01:24:06] So when you say proud to say something, so much more valuable.
[01:24:08] Yeah, talks a little bit about, uh, well, the psychological impact of combat.
[01:24:17] I know something about the strain of combat for five years in Nicaragua, March, at least
[01:24:21] 20 days a month under constant foot out of enemy ambushed.
[01:24:26] But I never saw those, but I never saw those Indian troops any sign of battle fatigue or
[01:24:31] anything resembling it.
[01:24:32] In a pacific, I saw a lot of our people break down. my reaction is this, what does it matter?
[01:24:38] How you're killed if you're killed in battle?
[01:24:40] Why does the louder noise in a fight with every artillery embombs makes such a difference?
[01:24:44] I think the difference is entirely in the mind and the preparation of men for combat.
[01:24:50] In Haiti, actions when I fought, the men were all picked volunteers, professionals who were
[01:24:55] paid to fight and realized they might die in the trade.
[01:24:59] I'm sure from my own experience that it's the mental attitude.
[01:25:03] I went through the worst days they had on Guadalcanal and I didn't suffer a bit.
[01:25:07] I lost some weight, but that was because we didn't get the proper food.
[01:25:11] If we make our men tough in the mind before they go to war and give them an honest idea
[01:25:17] of what war is like, we won't have so much of this trouble.
[01:25:22] Why do we have to baby them with all this crap about careers and opportunity and foreign
[01:25:27] travel?
[01:25:28] Oh, yeah.
[01:25:31] You know what I mean?
[01:25:33] You know what I mean?
[01:25:34] Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[01:25:37] They say, forget where I read this, but people who come back from war, they kind of differentiated
[01:25:46] where people who were in it, like JPE and you and I just always wanted to do this, to
[01:25:53] be a combat leader, to be a Navy SEAL, to be a commando, typically people with that kind
[01:25:57] of attitude, they don't get affected by it because it's kind of like the thing.
[01:26:01] They get affected less.
[01:26:02] Yeah, generally.
[01:26:03] You are correct.
[01:26:04] Generally, guys that like special operations, guys, that's what they wanted to do.
[01:26:10] There's a little bunch of other things that play into that as well.
[01:26:14] The training, because he's talking about hard training, well, that's what, in special
[01:26:17] operations, you do get harder training.
[01:26:20] You have a tighter, or you have a real close relationship with all your guys and you
[01:26:25] stay together with your guys.
[01:26:27] That is helpful too.
[01:26:30] It's not any tighter relationship that you have in an infantry, because in trust me, I've
[01:26:33] seen those in Marine Corps and Army infantry and military units get tight, doesn't matter
[01:26:38] whether your special operations are not.
[01:26:40] But the training, they step up the training, they make it really hard.
[01:26:44] That plays a role, but I think your right is that guys that think that that's what they
[01:26:48] want to do, then that helps as well.
[01:26:51] There's a bunch of little factors, but I think what his point is, like there's two,
[01:26:57] there's two points.
[01:26:58] Number one, make the training hard as, I guess there's three points.
[01:27:01] Number one, make the training hard as hell.
[01:27:03] Number two, make sure people know it too expect and don't talk to them about the career
[01:27:09] opportunities.
[01:27:10] Right.
[01:27:11] I just answered this question on the way of the warrior kid bought cast, right?
[01:27:13] Well, I answered the question, the question was, is it fun to be an AV seal?
[01:27:17] And I answered the question, hey, is it fun?
[01:27:21] Yes, absolutely, it's fun.
[01:27:23] That's part of it.
[01:27:24] But the other part of it is you are going to go to war and you could die.
[01:27:29] And that's a harsh thing to tell a nine-year-old or a ten-year-old.
[01:27:32] But that's exactly what you should tell a nine-year-old or a ten-year-old.
[01:27:35] Because that's what you're signing up for.
[01:27:38] I was doing another interview recently and I told this story and I've told it before,
[01:27:44] but it was like the first time some woman that I had been working with a company and some
[01:27:50] woman that had her husband or something.
[01:27:54] Anyways, the woman said, can you meet my son?
[01:27:58] He really wants to be an AV seal.
[01:28:00] And I was, you know, I said, oh, yeah, sure.
[01:28:03] The kid was whatever 17 or 18 years old.
[01:28:05] He was a junior senior in high school and he was this strapping kid who was, you know,
[01:28:11] looked like a great athlete and she wanted to bring me to lunch with him.
[01:28:15] So we went to lunch and it was, you know, the details of the story.
[01:28:20] I don't recall exactly, but it was basically, you know, my son, he wants to be an AV seal.
[01:28:26] He's on the swim team and he's on the track team and he played football and he just loves
[01:28:29] working out and he just, I think he'd be great.
[01:28:32] He just, he can do 28 pull-ups and the kids like, yeah, I love working out and I plus
[01:28:37] I surf too and I love the ocean.
[01:28:38] I love the water.
[01:28:40] It was like cool and, you know, for a while, you know, I was listening and then, you know,
[01:28:45] of course I was like, yeah, you know, that sounds like, sounds like you'd be well-prepared
[01:28:50] for the physical aspects of it.
[01:28:53] But when you have to remember that the reason you become a seal is so you can go and fight
[01:28:56] in wars and you're going to kill people and you're going to be at the risk of dying
[01:28:59] and you're going to be at the risk of being wounded and that's what's going to happen to
[01:29:03] your friends if not you.
[01:29:07] And when I got done saying like on that sentence, the mom's face completely changed.
[01:29:12] Because it's what he's talking about right here, which is, hey, you know, it's travel
[01:29:17] and adventure and career opportunities like no, what it is is war and savagery and the
[01:29:24] worst things that you could possibly experience is what you're going to experience.
[01:29:29] That's what you need to tell people.
[01:29:31] Yeah, the special operations and the conclusion for what I was reading there was,
[01:29:36] people when they go in knowing and kind of how they put it, like forward leaning into the
[01:29:44] realities of a military situation, it tends to be special operations or guys who want to
[01:29:49] do it for that reason.
[01:29:51] Not the guy who got sold on World Travel, the way I got to college.
[01:29:54] That guy is definitely going to have a rough time with it.
[01:29:58] And you've got to remember, too, there's hundreds of there's a massive percentage of Army
[01:30:04] infantry, Marine Corps infantry, guess what they want to be?
[01:30:07] Marine Corps infantry, they want to be, that's what they want to do.
[01:30:09] They're just as passionate about that as some guy, like, because that job, it's a little
[01:30:14] bit different, but a lot of that parts of that job are, you know, when we had Brian
[01:30:18] Stan on, we talked about this, you know, like Brian Stan was, you get to be in charge
[01:30:24] of more people, you get, it's a different dynamic, but the combat leadership opportunities
[01:30:30] and just the combat opportunities.
[01:30:33] I mean, when we were in the body, the guy's the infantry in the body, let's guys
[01:30:37] were freaking getting after it.
[01:30:38] They were just, it was insane to watch those guys.
[01:30:42] So, you know, there's plenty, I mean, there's the vast majority or there's plenty of guys
[01:30:48] in the regular conventional forces.
[01:30:51] They do just as good after combat as the special operations guys do.
[01:30:57] So it's more, and we talked about this Peter Tia.
[01:30:59] It was like, if a guy's fractured going in, it doesn't matter if he's special operations
[01:31:03] or conventional forces or general purpose units, he's, if he's fractured going in, the
[01:31:08] war's going to mess him up.
[01:31:09] Yeah.
[01:31:10] If he's solid going in, he's going to do well.
[01:31:13] So that's the determining factor.
[01:31:15] The training definitely helps.
[01:31:17] The telling people the truth upfront definitely helps, but you don't know what you're going
[01:31:23] to get.
[01:31:24] Yeah.
[01:31:25] And there's also plenty guys' special operations that do have serious issues.
[01:31:28] Yeah.
[01:31:29] And the article wasn't about like special operations.
[01:31:31] That's not what it was about.
[01:31:32] It was more about the state of mind.
[01:31:33] I think special where I know that special operations was just like an example of some
[01:31:38] point that they were making.
[01:31:39] Well, we talked again, I'm referencing all these different podcasts, but when Jordan Peterson
[01:31:43] was on, we talked about like the offensive mindset.
[01:31:46] Right.
[01:31:47] And the offensive you can be, generally, the more psychologically comforting that is.
[01:31:52] It's psychologically uncomfortable to be on the defensive.
[01:31:55] Yeah.
[01:31:56] And it's more psychologically comfortable to be on the offensive.
[01:31:59] Right.
[01:32:00] Did I just get that right?
[01:32:01] Yes.
[01:32:02] Psychologically uncomfortable to be on the defensive psychologically more comfortable.
[01:32:06] It's not necessarily comfortable because you still have bad things that can happen when
[01:32:10] you're on offense, but it's definitely psychologically more comfortable.
[01:32:13] Yeah.
[01:32:14] So those things play a role.
[01:32:15] Yeah.
[01:32:16] I'm going to like, you happen like to your experience, right?
[01:32:19] You consider an experience.
[01:32:20] It's like, I'm going to happen to this experience rather than this experience.
[01:32:23] It'll be offensive.
[01:32:24] It's a defensive.
[01:32:25] Absolutely.
[01:32:26] We will say, hey, how life is life treating you versus how are you treating life?
[01:32:33] You know that old saying.
[01:32:34] Yeah.
[01:32:35] You see what I'm saying?
[01:32:36] I'll go with it.
[01:32:37] Yeah.
[01:32:38] Just go with it.
[01:32:39] Here's another thing that he calls out.
[01:32:41] And this is very interesting.
[01:32:43] And everyone that's in the military will hear this and kind of shake their head.
[01:32:48] The practice of having command post exercises, Polar said, though he realized that he was
[01:32:53] trading on prominent toes in his audience, we take skeleton forces of headquarters troops
[01:32:58] and the like, just a handful and go through exercises so often that we forget we aren't
[01:33:03] simulating that we aren't simulating actual warfare.
[01:33:06] It has become so bad that even platoons are carrying out command post exercises.
[01:33:11] In battle, of course, once you set up a CP, which is a command post, you stop for all,
[01:33:17] you stop all forward motion.
[01:33:19] Because the commander sit on their duffs in relative security.
[01:33:23] And when you halt forward motion, you get in trouble immediately.
[01:33:27] I have to admit, we have to learn.
[01:33:30] I admit we have to learn how to handle commands, but we've carried it to a ridiculous
[01:33:34] extreme.
[01:33:37] They do a lot of that command exercises.
[01:33:40] The most unrealistic thing about it is like he's saying that you'll have not a real
[01:33:44] platoon, but like a small representation of a platoon.
[01:33:49] So the commander can move that platoon around really easily because it's this little thing.
[01:33:52] But then when you have a real platoon that takes real vehicles and real, it's like moving
[01:33:58] pieces on a board that's opposed to like, well, you move this battalion from here to there.
[01:34:04] All you do is just move this move their piece on a board.
[01:34:08] That was real easy.
[01:34:09] You look at what actually happens in the field when you move that piece of a battalion.
[01:34:13] It's massive.
[01:34:14] It's this incredible project to make it happen.
[01:34:19] Yeah.
[01:34:20] To move a battalion, you know, four miles or two miles or whatever.
[01:34:25] It's like, this is what it's going to take.
[01:34:28] Fuel and food and ammunition and wounded and planning and all this stuff.
[01:34:32] But the person up top just goes, oh yeah, we'll just have that entire day.
[01:34:34] Yeah.
[01:34:35] One morning as he approached a company of his men lounging among their tents, a newly
[01:34:40] arrived lieutenant, barked in order and the reen scramble to their feet standing and
[01:34:44] attention.
[01:34:45] What the hell's wrong with you, Polarord?
[01:34:46] Don't you think I've got more sense than to manned that you put on a show every time
[01:34:50] I come with him pistol range, get back down on your duffs.
[01:34:54] You ought to know me well enough that I'm no damned, banned box soldier.
[01:34:59] Take it easy.
[01:35:00] There's enough for you to do when we get to our next assignment.
[01:35:03] Again, dichotomy.
[01:35:04] It's okay.
[01:35:05] You don't need to snap to attention every time I come around.
[01:35:09] There's an army quartermaster and the general showed up and they had asked for a bunch
[01:35:16] of shotgun shells.
[01:35:18] Here we go back to the book.
[01:35:19] He's asked for 10,000 brass buckshot shells.
[01:35:22] What the devilities he want with those?
[01:35:24] To kill Japs with Sir doesn't Colonel Polar know that Buckshot is prohibited by the Geneva
[01:35:29] Convention.
[01:35:30] Sir, Colonel Polar doesn't give a damn about the Geneva Convention anymore than the
[01:35:34] Japs did at Pearl Harbor.
[01:35:43] Now as they're getting ready to go and assault, Gloster, the enemy had word of the coming
[01:35:52] assault.
[01:35:53] Radio Tokyo Blair'd one afternoon in late December the first American Marine Division
[01:35:58] Assorted cutthroats, degenerates and jail birds has been chased out of Melbourne is now
[01:36:05] in Camp and New Guinea and will try to invade Cape Gloster.
[01:36:09] I'm pleased to add that our soldiers are fully prepared to repulse the Sinslow attempt.
[01:36:13] The jungles will run red with the blood of the Guadalcanal butchers.
[01:36:17] So that's the propaganda cutthroats degenerates and jail birds.
[01:36:24] So now they're going to Gloster.
[01:36:25] Cape Gloster.
[01:36:27] On the early morning of December 26, they stood off Cape Gloster.
[01:36:30] Big guns on the fleet rolled for a half for an hour and a half beginning before dawn
[01:36:35] in the Marines in their traditional D-Day Breck.
[01:36:37] Eighth their traditional D-Day Breckfist of Staken Eggs.
[01:36:41] While Salva's shook the holes beneath them.
[01:36:44] Third Battalion 7th Marines landed first quickly followed by Polar's old Battalion which
[01:36:48] floundered through a marass behind the beach and pushed up the tall noll already known
[01:36:54] to aviators and shipgunners as target hill.
[01:36:57] An hour after the 7th was ashore, the first Marines came, turned toward the airfield
[01:37:01] and walked into a well-laid Japanese ambush.
[01:37:04] Tank's came into clear the enemy from their hidden bunkers and by nightfall the first
[01:37:10] was well on its way to the airfield.
[01:37:12] A falling tree in the soggy forest injured one Marine and otherwise they were only 20 killed
[01:37:18] and 22 wounded on D-Day.
[01:37:20] The most dangerous casualties were estimated at 50 on December 30th the first and fifth secured
[01:37:26] the field after hand-to-hand fighting in which they had to call on tanks for help.
[01:37:32] One sergeant remembered a moment from a mortar attack by the enemy.
[01:37:36] A kid sitting there in his foxhole he didn't have any head.
[01:37:39] He just had a neck with dog tags on it.
[01:37:41] A gray faced youngster nearby was muttering as he fled, as he fired his rifle, it don't
[01:37:46] do any good.
[01:37:47] I got three of them but it don't do any good.
[01:37:49] The Japanese sniper said infiltrated the line and killed Marines at short range and one unit
[01:37:54] tried to waive the stream was broken.
[01:37:58] It survivors driven to hide in the weeds on the edge.
[01:38:02] From midstream a boy who failed to make it over hung over a log is body riddled by a
[01:38:08] score of bullets.
[01:38:09] For an half an hour or more he called to his mates before he died.
[01:38:12] I'm here.
[01:38:14] Here I am.
[01:38:16] The attack had stalled, but line had now become you-shaped with a pocket of the enemy holding
[01:38:21] back the center.
[01:38:24] General Rupertus from division relieved the commander of the third battalion seventh
[01:38:28] Marines and sent Polar into action once more with orders to reorganize and drive forward
[01:38:34] the unit.
[01:38:38] So they weren't making any progress.
[01:38:45] The commander said you know what, I'm pulling Polar back in action.
[01:38:49] Send the wolf.
[01:38:52] The trouble was the same and here's Polar talking to his guys as he showed up.
[01:38:57] The Polar was the same old thing.
[01:38:59] The trouble was the same old thing.
[01:39:00] Staff officers don't know the meaning of terrain and how it conslowed down troops and
[01:39:05] cost lives.
[01:39:06] I went up to the front about two in the afternoon.
[01:39:08] I called the company commanders and told them as briefly as I could what I had in mind.
[01:39:12] I've been sent to take over, your commander has been relieved.
[01:39:15] I don't intend to believe you can bet on that.
[01:39:19] We're going to attack here in the morning.
[01:39:21] There were protests that the jab bunkers could not be seen and that they were cutting
[01:39:25] up our line.
[01:39:26] I told them I had the medicine for that.
[01:39:27] I ordered up some of Joe Buckley's half-tracks because I knew their guns could deal
[01:39:31] with the bunkers.
[01:39:33] The resistance was fairly light, but the staff orders were so foolish that we were just
[01:39:38] sitting targets that we were making sitting targets of our people.
[01:39:41] The blockley did a great job there as he always did.
[01:39:43] They had orders and these battions to guide both right and left in order that can't be
[01:39:48] followed well even on a pernate parade ground.
[01:39:51] Any beginner knows that you can guide left or you can guide right or even center, but
[01:39:56] you can't follow two leaders on either side at the same time.
[01:39:59] The line will buckle and cause gaps.
[01:40:01] We were frustrating the troops with delays to reform the line.
[01:40:06] I just said now we will go forward and forget about all this guiding business.
[01:40:10] We forget there is anybody on the flanks.
[01:40:12] We have enough power here to drive and we are going to drive, blow your way through
[01:40:16] think of nothing else.
[01:40:20] So important part there once again.
[01:40:23] You can't follow multiple leaders at the same time.
[01:40:26] He's talking about a physical example.
[01:40:28] Guiding in the military is when you are marching, you line up with a person to your left
[01:40:35] usually.
[01:40:36] These people say no line up with a person to your left and the person to your right.
[01:40:40] How the hell are you going to do that?
[01:40:43] You'd not.
[01:40:44] That's the answer.
[01:40:47] Before the gun stopped a staff officer from division, a staff officer from division went
[01:40:57] up on the line.
[01:40:59] And here he says, I went up there in the heaviest of the action when fire was flying all
[01:41:02] around us.
[01:41:03] Polar walked around outside the wire at hill 660 and stopped that every dugout to talk
[01:41:08] to some kid.
[01:41:09] He'd say, how's things going there old man?
[01:41:12] Just as if he'd come next door to borrow a couple of sugar.
[01:41:16] Those kids thought it was the greatest thing that ever happened.
[01:41:18] You'd think you'd been handing out $1,000 bills down the line and there was someplace
[01:41:22] to spend them.
[01:41:24] Polar had found one demoralized boy sitting stonely in his hole looking out with a tell
[01:41:29] tale thousand yard stare.
[01:41:30] He muttered over and over.
[01:41:32] Colonel, we got to get the hell out of here.
[01:41:35] That's no way to talk old man.
[01:41:37] I'm going to let the boy a few paces to the rear and sat with him for 10 minutes or so.
[01:41:41] Look old man, I want to go home too.
[01:41:43] I'm not getting any younger.
[01:41:44] Hell, I'm 45 years old.
[01:41:46] You know that?
[01:41:47] I got a family at home.
[01:41:48] I know this dump is no good, but neither of us is going home until we lick these bastards.
[01:41:54] We've got to make, we've got to help make our folks at home safe too.
[01:41:59] I'll try and get you some hot chow up here old man.
[01:42:02] So again, you just got a guy that's totally gets it.
[01:42:14] Lots of heavy fighting.
[01:42:15] They get plaster secured in February 1944.
[01:42:19] Polar had a physical examination in the cape and the camp at Cape Gloster and aside from
[01:42:24] a notation of a recent attack of malaria was found in perfect condition.
[01:42:28] On the same day upon hearing rumored that one third of the veterans of Gwala Canal was to
[01:42:32] be rotated back to the states, Polar wrote general Holcomb, the common dont in terms which
[01:42:37] would have been appreciated by a Caesar or Napoleon.
[01:42:42] It is respectfully requested that my present assignment to a combat unit be extended until
[01:42:48] the downfall of the Japanese Empire.
[01:42:54] Freaking gets them.
[01:42:58] The division recouped in Drew placements, the first of the new weapons began to appear
[01:43:02] in quantities.
[01:43:03] The Springfield is almost disappeared now to Polar Sorrow.
[01:43:07] He was interested in the first of a new style flame frower when an officer brought one
[01:43:11] by.
[01:43:12] The youngster proudly explained the work of the deadly torch and looked to Polar for approval.
[01:43:18] Where's the bayonet fit on it?
[01:43:21] The another like famous quote from Chestie Polar.
[01:43:25] There's a flame frower but you need to put a bayonet fitting on it just in case.
[01:43:31] He's counseling his officers about showing being brave and stepping up.
[01:43:41] At the same time, here's the, here's the dichotomy.
[01:43:44] He says, I don't want you to go up under the guns just for show.
[01:43:48] It's only the idiots and green kids who think they're bulletproof, but if you don't
[01:43:51] show some courage, your officers won't show it either.
[01:43:54] And the kids will hang back.
[01:43:56] It's that, it's that kind of an outfit that always has trouble.
[01:44:03] Next we go.
[01:44:04] Polar returned to Pavuvo to find a new stern the camps.
[01:44:07] The Allied landings in France were expanding.
[01:44:10] The new B-29s had begun to bomb Tokyo, Saipan and Falun, whole fleets of cargo ships had
[01:44:16] brought the first division new equipment to Pavuvo and there was a word of an independent
[01:44:20] role for the Marines in a new operation.
[01:44:23] General MacArthur would follow his own southern course on island hopping, but the core would
[01:44:27] stab into the central Pacific.
[01:44:30] Polar occurred hardly conceive of the scope of the new Marine Corps, which he had known
[01:44:34] to as a force of a mere 19,000 as pre-war days.
[01:44:38] They were now five divisions and, and a brigade in the Pacific and another division in training
[01:44:43] in California, well over a hundred thousand men.
[01:44:47] In late July, on that same day Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman were nominated
[01:44:52] for the coming elections back home, Marines landed on Guam.
[01:44:57] A few days after Louis got the news.
[01:45:01] Lieutenant Colonel Sam Polar had been killed, shot through the heart by a machine gunner's
[01:45:06] bullet.
[01:45:08] His intonates notice a new reserve in the Colonel in these days, but it was not long before
[01:45:13] still another false report which added to the growing Polar legend.
[01:45:18] As whispered that, when he got ordered of Sam's death, he had said grimly, those who lived
[01:45:24] by the sword must die by the sword.
[01:45:28] The loss of Sam had in fact touched Louis deeply.
[01:45:32] He covered it with silence and a hurry turning to other topics when officers spoke
[01:45:36] of his brother's death.
[01:45:39] On Pavu-vu, the division intensified its work and swed it at war games on the beaches
[01:45:45] and in the palm groves, there was a new watchword.
[01:45:48] The Pelaloo, the next target.
[01:45:57] So his brother, Lieutenant Colonel Sam Polar was killed and he got word about.
[01:46:06] Hundred-only-hundred-thousand Marines that might seem like a lot, but that's not a lot.
[01:46:12] You consider the tasks they had before them.
[01:46:20] So now they're heading to Pelaloo, the next target.
[01:46:26] When the big fleet left for the Polars to follow the bombardment ships, there was but
[01:46:31] a single somber note.
[01:46:33] A board one of the vessels were stacks of many hundreds of white wooden crosses far more
[01:46:38] than a two-day supply.
[01:46:44] Two days from Pelaloo, there was a report from the underwater demolition teams who's
[01:46:48] met at boldly swam into shore and inspected, jab defences.
[01:46:52] Nothing serious they said the way would be cleared.
[01:46:56] Polars' mind was not relieved.
[01:46:58] He had never before felt pessimism at the opening of a battle.
[01:47:08] Now we're starting the invasion.
[01:47:12] There was no moon.
[01:47:13] The sky was filled with stars and there was not a trace of cloud.
[01:47:16] Toward the dawn of September 15, the transports had come into position.
[01:47:20] All the horizon, the guns, the guns of the fleet spurred in fire.
[01:47:24] For hours the thunder was unbroken, but as gray-edge sky, as gray-edge the sky, pace,
[01:47:31] slowed and the fire became disultry.
[01:47:34] The island was invisible.
[01:47:39] The troops had breakfast before daylight, staking eggs again.
[01:47:44] When the first of them came to the decks, the chain of the Polars lay in a black silhouette
[01:47:50] across the sea.
[01:47:52] There was a moderate swell, a breeze sprang up coming from the island of Pelaloo.
[01:47:58] The guns broke into a full cry once more and the final shelling struck target.
[01:48:02] The two assault battalions of the first Marines went aboard the big landing vehicles on
[01:48:06] the decks.
[01:48:07] The moths of the ships clanked open in the amphibious tractors were spewed forth, milling
[01:48:11] as they formed lines ready to move forward toward the breach.
[01:48:15] They were 4,000 yards out.
[01:48:17] Vast flights of planes came over.
[01:48:20] Weeling in from all directions, they dived, bombed and climbed over Pelaloo for an hour
[01:48:24] or more and soon after the first of the bombs fell a slow, hesitant curtain gathered over
[01:48:30] the land.
[01:48:31] It seemed impossible that anything living could have endured, but at last as the assault began,
[01:48:36] a puff of anti-aircraft smoke flowered in the sky and a plane dropped in flames.
[01:48:42] Just before 830, the first wave started shoreward.
[01:48:45] Pelaloo watched for the signal flag to dip from the yard arm of a control boat in his
[01:48:49] front.
[01:48:50] The amtrecks fomed away on the broad wakes.
[01:48:54] At almost 830 precisely, the vehicle ground on the sand, Polar never forgot the scene.
[01:49:00] I went up over the side as fast as I could, scrambled and ran like hell at least 25 yards
[01:49:05] before I hit the beach flat down.
[01:49:07] When I looked back to the amtrak, I saw 4 or 5 shells hit it all at once.
[01:49:12] A few men were killed getting out too slow, but most of them were saved because they
[01:49:15] got out before we stopped moving.
[01:49:18] We lost our communications officer.
[01:49:20] His leg was blown off and he couldn't be saved.
[01:49:22] I looked down the beach and saw a mess.
[01:49:24] Every damned amtrak in our wave had been destroyed in the water by the enemy or shot
[01:49:28] the pieces the minute it landed.
[01:49:31] I tried to get a line set up for defense.
[01:49:33] The wiremen were there fast as soon as I was doing their job without further orders.
[01:49:37] And we lost several of them in the hop fire.
[01:49:40] Every puttune leader was trying to form a line of his own.
[01:49:43] Just as I was.
[01:49:44] Runners were going up and down the beach as we tried to get organized.
[01:49:48] That big promatory on my left hadn't been touched by all the ship's guns and planes.
[01:49:53] And we got a whirlwind of machine gun and anti-tank fire.
[01:49:58] Polar second battalion drove through a heavy growth of woods now torn by the shelling and
[01:50:03] by 930 ad driven 350 yards ahead.
[01:50:07] To the edge of the airfield, they tied on the line of the fifth Marines.
[01:50:11] Casualties were reported as heavy but the trial of the second had only begun.
[01:50:15] The new position was faced by an obstacle marked on none of the invasion maps.
[01:50:19] A sheer coral ridge whose sides were honeycomb with Japanese positions from foxholes to
[01:50:25] gigantic dugouts of reinforced steel and concrete.
[01:50:29] Some of them with four levels, each of which could be closed off with steel doors.
[01:50:35] For eight hours the regiment endured the most savage fighting of the Pacific War.
[01:50:46] General Smith had come a short 1130 a.m.
[01:50:52] When the phone line was spliced, spliced late in the afternoon and he talked with Polar
[01:50:56] he had only one.
[01:50:59] He had only a com report.
[01:51:00] We're dug in solid and we've got the 01 phase line all right.
[01:51:04] Polar night made no mention of especially heavy casualties or of need for help.
[01:51:09] It was estimated that the first Marines had lost 500 men during the day.
[01:51:14] The first water that had come ashore and oil drums and was foul.
[01:51:18] Polar shouted his rage to the officers on the ships, bellowing for new supplies.
[01:51:26] Here's Polar's report.
[01:51:29] Enemy well dug in, opposition strong, little damage done by our preliminary fire, hard
[01:51:35] fight ahead, casualties over 20%.
[01:51:39] I've ordered no man to be evacuated unless from bullet or shell wounds, request further
[01:51:44] supply, fresh water, are still und drinkable, men wretched.
[01:51:58] Polar called division and talked with Colonel Seld in the chief of staff.
[01:52:03] He remembered the year the conversation years later.
[01:52:05] Johnny half my regiment has gone, I've got to have replacements if I'm to carry out division
[01:52:10] orders tomorrow morning.
[01:52:12] You know we have no replacements, Louis.
[01:52:14] I told you before we came ashore that we should have at least one regiment reserve.
[01:52:18] We're not fighting a third.
[01:52:20] We're not fighting a third of the men we brought in.
[01:52:22] All these damn specialists you brought.
[01:52:26] Anything wrong with your orders, Louis?
[01:52:27] No.
[01:52:28] I'm ready to go ahead, but you know my casualties are 50%.
[01:52:32] What do you want me to do?
[01:52:33] Give me some of those 17,000 men on the beach.
[01:52:36] You can't have them, they're not trained in for infantry, given to me and by nightfall
[01:52:40] tomorrow they'll be trained in infantry.
[01:52:43] Polar went out with a runner stumbling through the night to find post of his battalion commanders
[01:52:48] and pass on the order.
[01:52:49] We press attack at 80 clock in the morning, no change, full speed, use every man.
[01:52:58] He fell more than once and cut himself on the coral.
[01:53:02] He left for an order and others left at headquarters noticed that the Colonel was beginning
[01:53:06] to limp and that his left leg is swollen.
[01:53:10] Seldon called back, pulled in.
[01:53:11] You got my orders okay?
[01:53:13] Yes, you need an explain further.
[01:53:15] I just came back from my battalions.
[01:53:17] We're going to take ground tomorrow without replacements.
[01:53:20] We're willing to try, but don't forget we're just going to add 10 or 15% to our casualties.
[01:53:30] In the sun rose on September 18th, 200 of the 473 men in Polar's third battalion were
[01:53:35] headquarters personnel, many frontline units had been decimated.
[01:53:40] Long before noon, there were cases of heat prostration, the blazing sun was hotter than ever.
[01:53:46] Faces and lips were cracked and bleeding.
[01:53:48] Salt pills became scarce again.
[01:53:51] Polar was optimistic, for they started the attack from high ground, but the crucial
[01:53:55] days still lay ahead.
[01:53:58] Tank atoms came by Polar's command post and found him half-clad and filthy, sweat soaked
[01:54:03] trousers with a heavy beard on his face.
[01:54:08] I'm coming back this afternoon, Colonel.
[01:54:10] Do you want me to bring you a fresh uniform?
[01:54:12] Hell, Hank, I've got no time for that.
[01:54:14] Every man in the outfit will get clean before I do.
[01:54:18] Lieutenant Colonel Lou Walt, now the executive officer of the fifth Marine saw Polar at
[01:54:23] a command conference during the day.
[01:54:27] He was absolutely sick over the loss of his men.
[01:54:39] The enemy fought hand-to-hand until daylight, beating off charges that no survivor could
[01:54:44] count.
[01:54:46] As first light spilled over the ridge, the shrunken company beat back the last Japanese
[01:54:50] attack with stones, ammunition boxes, bare fists, and bayonets.
[01:54:57] Several of the enemy were flung bodily off the cliff and fell shrieking into the splintered
[01:55:02] coral below.
[01:55:12] But they did it.
[01:55:15] At the end of the day, the regiment reported a total of 1,878 men lost since day.
[01:55:22] The fighting went on without a break until September 23rd when the first Marines rested
[01:55:26] in lines without advancing.
[01:55:29] They beat off several counterattacks and patrols pushed out 1,000 yards down the west coast
[01:55:35] without serious opposition.
[01:55:38] The regiment was relieved at 2pm of this day by the 320 first regiment of the 81st Army
[01:55:44] Division.
[01:55:45] The new commander took one look at the forward command post Polar at a occupied and ordered
[01:55:51] it moved more than 1,000 yards to the rear.
[01:55:57] In nine days on the line, Polar's regiment had eliminated one major blockhouse and 144 defended
[01:56:03] caves in lesser pill boxes.
[01:56:06] Division reported that 3,942 Japanese had been killed in the regiment's zone.
[01:56:11] No enemy had been captured.
[01:56:14] Polar's total casualty of men were 56%.
[01:56:17] The highest regimental losses in the history of the corps.
[01:56:23] First battalion had lost 71%.
[01:56:26] The second 56% the third 55%.
[01:56:30] Headquarters and weapons companies 32%.
[01:56:36] General Smith, who walked the terrain after it was finally captured, said it seemed impossible
[01:56:40] that men could have moved forward against the intricate and mutually supporting defenses.
[01:56:45] The Japanese had set up.
[01:56:48] It can only be explained as a reflection of the determination and aggressive leadership
[01:56:53] of Colonel Polar.
[01:57:05] Now, Polar, that's the last major combat for Polar.
[01:57:10] Was it Pelaloo?
[01:57:12] He ends up going back to the states for a bit and while he's back on the states, back
[01:57:17] in the states, America drops the atomic bombs on Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the war is over
[01:57:28] and shortly thereafter, they order General Polar to our Colonel Polar at this time to the
[01:57:41] reserves.
[01:57:42] Now, like I said, he didn't get along with some people, especially up the chain of command.
[01:57:51] And he didn't want to be sent to the reserves because that's not what a career marine
[01:57:57] wants to do.
[01:57:58] So here we go back to the book.
[01:57:59] Colonel, you've been ordered to reserve duty in New Orleans.
[01:58:03] It's a big district.
[01:58:04] You know, and very important to the corps.
[01:58:09] Polar was not misled.
[01:58:11] He realized what it meant to be shown to reserve duty into a side pocket.
[01:58:16] Many marine career had ended that way.
[01:58:21] One of the inevitable problems with the Marine Corps, and this is Polar talking, one
[01:58:25] of the inevitable problems with the Marine Corps or any other military services that staff
[01:58:30] officers take over the minute of war is ended.
[01:58:34] The combat people run things when the chips are down and the country's life is at stake,
[01:58:38] but when the gun stop, nobody's got use for a combat man.
[01:58:43] The staff officers are like rats.
[01:58:45] They stream out of hiding and take over.
[01:58:47] It's true.
[01:58:48] Just watch what happens to paperwork.
[01:58:50] God in peacetime, they'll put out enough to sink a small, sized nation into the sea.
[01:58:54] And when the war breaks out, most of it just naturally stops.
[01:58:58] That's the way they do everything.
[01:58:59] There must be a staff of people, of course, or we never get everything done.
[01:59:03] But if we don't stop this empire building of staff, somebody's going to come along
[01:59:07] and lick us one of these days will be so nodded and red-daped that we can't move.
[01:59:14] Well, we've never seen that seal-team thing.
[01:59:27] You put it on a T-shirt or something, but it's Freddy the frog, the little symbol of the frog
[01:59:33] man, the Freddy the frog, and he's like in a glass jar.
[01:59:37] Or a glass casing.
[01:59:40] And it says in case of war break glass, because you don't want the guy around when peacetime
[01:59:44] is going on.
[01:59:45] Right.
[01:59:46] That's what that's what chess.
[01:59:47] That's another chess-ty-puller, right?
[01:59:50] They don't want him during peacetime, because he's...causes, he speaks up.
[01:59:55] Well, peacetime lasts that long.
[02:00:00] On June 25th, 1950, North Korean troops poured across the 38th Paradella in strength and
[02:00:05] war had returned.
[02:00:07] Polar recognized all the signs.
[02:00:09] He immediately asked for a modification of his orders and said urgently to headquarters
[02:00:13] attention is invited to the fact that I served as an officer in Haiti in Nicaragua and
[02:00:17] in the Pacific Theater for eight years prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, this
[02:00:22] experience will prove a value in an assignment to combat duty in Korea.
[02:00:30] Well, the senior personnel know that and he gets what he asked for.
[02:00:36] Polar arrived in Southern California in the heat of late July and found San Diego in
[02:00:40] area of Bedlam.
[02:00:41] Marine reservists thronged in every corner of the nation's thousands of vehicle
[02:00:46] storage since World War II were being overhauled and driven to port.
[02:00:49] Trains bore regulars from the east coast, unattached officers came from everywhere without
[02:00:53] a call volunteers for war.
[02:00:56] The first Marine Division was being created almost from scratch.
[02:01:02] So they had dismantled so much of the service after World War II and now they've got
[02:01:07] to rebuild it all very quick.
[02:01:09] They do.
[02:01:10] They talk about it in the book.
[02:01:11] I skip over that, but we know what that consists of hardcore training, getting people
[02:01:16] ready for war.
[02:01:17] Finally, they get, he gets to Japan and they're waiting now to go in Korea into Korea.
[02:01:24] Polar hailed a passing medical corpsman and went to a nearby army hospital.
[02:01:28] I want to talk with some of the casualties.
[02:01:29] I've got to find out what's happening in Korea.
[02:01:32] He went up in an elevator with an army doctor who seemed on point on the point of tears,
[02:01:37] going to the words and see those kids and you'll soon know more about more than you
[02:01:40] want about Korea.
[02:01:43] Take a look at all the self-inflicted wounds we've got and those kids are so green.
[02:01:47] They don't even realize how obvious it is, just from the powder burns.
[02:01:52] Polar walked down many rows of beds, talking with the men, many of them frightened and broken
[02:01:57] and heard their tales of Korea.
[02:02:00] Polar was sobered, but not despair.
[02:02:04] He told some young, younger officers that night, there's nothing wrong with American
[02:02:08] kids.
[02:02:09] Their leadership has just all gone to hell.
[02:02:12] There's a whole hospital full of babies you might say.
[02:02:16] They were never given a chance to grow into men.
[02:02:18] It won't be that way with our Marines.
[02:02:24] I'll tell you that.
[02:02:26] You're prepared for D-Day in Inchon, to one of the biggest amphibious operations.
[02:02:33] They're getting ready for that and he has a little chat with his officers.
[02:02:39] We're the most fortunate of men.
[02:02:42] Most time, professional soldiers have to wait 25 years or more for a war.
[02:02:46] But here we are with only five years wait for this one.
[02:02:50] During that time, we've sat on our fat, duff, strong, or pay.
[02:02:53] Now we're getting a chance to earn it to show the taxpayers where a worth it.
[02:02:57] We're going to work at our trade for a little while.
[02:03:01] We live by the sword and if necessary, we'll be ready to die by the sword.
[02:03:05] Good luck.
[02:03:06] I'll see you ashore.
[02:03:10] And listen up old men.
[02:03:12] You have something to say to your officers or men, make it snappy.
[02:03:16] The fewer words the better.
[02:03:18] They won't believe it if you shoot bull.
[02:03:22] When you face ranks of men and try that, you can hear them sign despair when you open
[02:03:27] your mouth if they sense you're a phony.
[02:03:30] They can usually look at you and tell.
[02:03:32] Maybe it doesn't sound like it, but it's an important thing in a Marines career.
[02:03:40] Don't try and.
[02:03:42] Don't try and what does he call it?
[02:03:43] Shoot bull.
[02:03:44] Don't try and shoot bull.
[02:03:46] Tell the boys what's going on for real.
[02:03:48] They see right through you.
[02:03:51] Road is wife a letter before he leaves.
[02:03:53] Sweet.
[02:03:55] I will be unable to write you again for a few days, but you, Virginia, Virginia, Mac,
[02:04:02] Martha Lee and Lewis, those are his kids.
[02:04:06] We'll be constantly in my thoughts.
[02:04:08] And they God bless you, always, and provide for you, giving you much happiness and useful
[02:04:14] lives.
[02:04:17] You, my children, must take advantage of all opportunities and develop into good Christians,
[02:04:22] much love to all of you.
[02:04:24] I love you, Virginia.
[02:04:26] I always have.
[02:04:28] And I always will.
[02:04:36] You are going to in John.
[02:04:39] By 530 in the afternoon when the first waves the Marines reach the shore, the men of
[02:04:44] the fleet could no longer see in John.
[02:04:46] Hundreds of boats milled in the outer harbor in their turn, crossing the embarkation line
[02:04:51] and moving toward land where they disappeared into a bank of smoke and dust.
[02:04:55] Pulling wind into his objective at Blue Beach with the third wave in a twilight hasened
[02:05:00] but hastened by smoke, Paul, and climbed a 15 foot sea wall in one of the scaling ladders
[02:05:05] improvised on a ship in route.
[02:05:14] They meet some fairly light resistance.
[02:05:18] Here's what Pauler says, it won't amount to much tonight.
[02:05:21] We took him by surprise.
[02:05:24] Pauler's casualties had been light and the divisions total for the day was only 20 killed
[02:05:28] in 170 wounded.
[02:05:31] Pauler was awake at 330 a.m. calling the battalion commander making plans for an attack
[02:05:35] at dawn.
[02:05:37] Pauler's swift drive, hurried a joining forces in an effort to keep pace, capped and
[02:05:42] raised styles of ridges battalion saw that the secret was not only in Pauler's incisive
[02:05:50] orders.
[02:05:51] He gave us pride in some way I can't describe.
[02:05:54] All of us had heard hundreds of stories about him.
[02:05:56] And today that we couldn't actually see him doing great things, he kept building up on
[02:06:01] morale higher and higher just by being there.
[02:06:05] When we were moving up two companies from the adjoining battalions marched to breast and
[02:06:08] got a little mixed, one of the kid yelled, one of the kids yelled, what, what outfit are
[02:06:13] you with, Mac?
[02:06:15] Fifth Marines, how about you?
[02:06:16] I got a better.
[02:06:18] I'm in Polars.
[02:06:20] The troops in the first thought of the old man before they thought of their regimental
[02:06:24] number.
[02:06:28] By September 17th, D. Day plus two, General MacArthur was impatient to go ashore from
[02:06:33] the command ship Mount McKinley.
[02:06:35] He saw that his blow to Korea cut it into two and it taken the enemy by surprise and
[02:06:39] that chances of ending the war were good.
[02:06:45] He radioed Vice Admiral Arthur D. Strubel, the task force commander after the first
[02:06:50] good news from shore, the Navy and Marines have never shown more brightly than this
[02:06:55] morning, MacArthur.
[02:07:05] On one of the fiery days of the drive towards Seoul, a popular chaplain, father, Keating,
[02:07:10] captured five North Korean soldiers and herded them along as prisoners.
[02:07:15] He hailed a passing Marine Jeep driven by private wolf.
[02:07:19] On take these prisoners off my hands and get them to the rear before their hurt.
[02:07:23] I can't father, I'm running ammo into the edge of town and they're getting low.
[02:07:27] I can't stop to do it.
[02:07:29] Private, that's an order.
[02:07:32] Take them over.
[02:07:34] Wolf looked rearward at the burning city.
[02:07:37] You mean they're mine now under my responsibility?
[02:07:40] Yes.
[02:07:42] Wolf pulled up a light machine gun and sprayed the troops.
[02:07:46] sprayed the group killing all five prisoners.
[02:07:49] The outraged Keating went to polar and demanded action.
[02:07:52] Colonel Lisson's carefully ordered Wolf arrested and the priest went away, content that
[02:07:58] he had done as duty.
[02:08:00] Ten minutes later, polar acetone, what outfit was it that lost all those boys last night?
[02:08:06] Barrow's company, sir.
[02:08:08] All right.
[02:08:09] Give that boy wolf a bar and send him up there.
[02:08:15] Once took the story to his cronies as an example of the military justice at its best,
[02:08:20] it spread through the outfit to become part of the polar legend.
[02:08:27] Yeah.
[02:08:31] Yeah.
[02:08:32] That seems like a pretty square the way I think to do.
[02:08:36] There's like a platoon that's getting completely destroyed and they've taken a bunch
[02:08:41] of casualties and you got this kid that did something wrong.
[02:08:45] And we could arrest him and put him in prison or whatever, and we could send him up to
[02:08:50] fight.
[02:08:51] Polar sons of up to fight.
[02:08:56] In the seven days since D.A. there had been a 1,148 Marine casualties, 145 of these killed
[02:09:03] 20 more died of wounds and five were missing.
[02:09:08] The North Koreans, Polar Sedan, his deep drawing voice are defending the city in such
[02:09:13] a way as to force us to destroy it.
[02:09:16] There's a billion dollars worth of publicity in this.
[02:09:18] So this is when they're trying to get into Seoul and the North Koreans are defending Seoul
[02:09:22] very hard and polar basically has to get ultra aggressive in trying to take Seoul.
[02:09:34] Back to the book, the fire of artillery and mortars had set the record for the Korean war,
[02:09:38] the four battalions of artillery had fired all shells at hand and had depleted and nearby
[02:09:42] Army dump.
[02:09:44] The four point two mortars had fired 326 rounds and the big 81, 650 rounds.
[02:09:50] The 50 caliber machine guns had used 120 boxes or 30,000 rounds.
[02:09:55] The Knights battled, put Lieutenant Joe Fisher, Lieutenant Joe Fisher's item company to
[02:10:00] the test.
[02:10:01] Fisher dug in for the night on an isolated hill in the city's factory district, overlooking
[02:10:05] the roadblock which was on his left flank.
[02:10:08] The midnight to dawn he beat off waves of attack.
[02:10:13] Fisher called for artillery at the same time.
[02:10:16] Other frontline commanders asked for help.
[02:10:18] But between barrages from the North Korean swept up Fisher's hill in a bonsai charges
[02:10:24] urged by shrill force commanders in their rear.
[02:10:28] Item companies weapons including machine guns fired at top speed and bodies piled up
[02:10:33] below them toward the end when the attacks weekend.
[02:10:35] The fight turned into a turkey shoot and Fisher's men slaughtered the enemy.
[02:10:41] They were glad to see the sunrise.
[02:10:43] Fisher never forgot that daybreak.
[02:10:45] I looked down the hill behind me and saw a man hurring up towards our position.
[02:10:49] I could see that he wasn't lugging any ammunition and thought it must be an important message
[02:10:53] too hot for the radio.
[02:10:56] Then I saw that it was Colonel Polar's runner and he had brought us a bottle of black
[02:11:01] and white scotch.
[02:11:03] My God, were we glad to see that.
[02:11:05] It was passed down to the Paltoon with the most casualties and they rationed out to those
[02:11:09] who needed it most.
[02:11:11] We knew then that the old man was thinking of us and in fact never forgot us.
[02:11:20] Polar came upon Marines dug in around a barricade taken cover from fire down the street.
[02:11:25] He walked among them with the pipe stub and his mouth.
[02:11:27] Get up boys, get up and go.
[02:11:29] That's the quickest way to get it over.
[02:11:31] If you're going to get it, you can get it in holes too.
[02:11:36] The line moved.
[02:11:37] Joe Fisher saw Polar in the street.
[02:11:39] He was going along where the fire was heaviest.
[02:11:42] Just like he was back in Pendleton.
[02:11:43] As if he didn't know there was a fight within miles.
[02:11:46] I couldn't express how much good it did me and my troops to see him steady like that.
[02:11:50] Just puffing that pipe.
[02:11:52] It made us feel like we could do no less than he did.
[02:11:55] If there has ever been another one like him in the Marine Corps, I never saw him in my
[02:11:59] day.
[02:12:00] Bill Faringo, the veteran who is the field sergeant major had a glimpse of the Colonel.
[02:12:10] It was like going through hell passing down that soul street and who should we pass in
[02:12:15] the middle of it but chesty.
[02:12:17] It was so hot that I fought the grenades and ammunition.
[02:12:20] We carried wood explode.
[02:12:21] The flames almost met over our heads from the burning houses, but the Colonel didn't
[02:12:26] seem in the least concerned.
[02:12:27] It gave us an extra push.
[02:12:36] One of the most they wrap up this in-challenged invasion.
[02:12:39] One of the most demanding operations in Marine history had ended.
[02:12:42] The division had sustained 2,430 casualties, 414 of them dead.
[02:12:47] Of this total, 1,064 had been in the last five days in the streets of Seoul and its
[02:12:52] outskirts.
[02:12:54] His fifth Marines had the worst of it with 1,038 casualties, 177 dead.
[02:12:59] Polar had a total of 787 with 92 dead.
[02:13:04] Litsonberg, 368, 72 dead.
[02:13:12] Polar wrote another letter to his wife.
[02:13:16] Everything is quiet now and I have a little to do except get my reports prepared and submitted.
[02:13:20] I wish I had a flare for writing, as then I am certain this regiment would get the credit
[02:13:26] do when the history of this operation is finally written.
[02:13:30] Now everyone knows, but in a few years what is written will govern.
[02:13:35] Rest assured that I will do a better job of getting the facts in my reports than I did
[02:13:40] in the past war.
[02:13:42] I will also claim everything do the regiment.
[02:13:44] Many times I have regretted that my English education was cut short during the first
[02:13:48] war.
[02:13:50] Please do your best to impress upon our children the necessity of taking advantage of every
[02:13:54] opportunity in this hard old world of ours.
[02:14:03] He recognized this sad thing.
[02:14:06] It is the reality though.
[02:14:08] If you are in a leadership position in the military, you have to be able to write well.
[02:14:12] He regrets that he wasn't a little better at it.
[02:14:18] Intention in the English class folks.
[02:14:26] Polar Winners Shore, they were back at sea, Polar Winners Shore, and one of major treadwell's
[02:14:31] landing craft to be met broadly by a grinning Oliver Smith.
[02:14:35] Congratulations, Louis, you made it.
[02:14:37] Your board has selected you for Brigadier.
[02:14:41] Polar Wagged is head.
[02:14:42] By God if it hadn't been for this war, I had never got in that star.
[02:14:45] It was a mild celebration of Shore that night for the new general to be.
[02:14:49] He picked up his first star, as a general.
[02:14:55] Like he said, if it wasn't for the, you know, he'd been put down in some reserve unit
[02:14:59] new Orleans.
[02:15:00] He wasn't going to make general there.
[02:15:02] But the case of war, break glass.
[02:15:05] Now he makes general.
[02:15:06] Polar wrote home daily.
[02:15:08] He sent Virginia $5 check for her good school in Mark.
[02:15:11] You're good school marks, adding some parental advice.
[02:15:16] I'm very proud of my family and expected to do well plus in everything you undertake.
[02:15:21] The difference between success and failure in this life of ours is mostly hard work.
[02:15:27] So you must constantly work to try and improve yourself.
[02:15:32] I think we could just frame that statement.
[02:15:38] On November 10th, the Marine Corps's birthday, Polar used a captured North Korean sword to slice
[02:15:44] a hundred pound cake.
[02:15:46] He shouted to his troops after he got done delivering the article from a manual.
[02:15:54] He shouted out, now that that's complied with, I want to tell you something straight.
[02:15:58] Just do one thing for me.
[02:16:00] Write your people back home and tell them there's one hell of a damn war going on
[02:16:04] out here and that the Raggedy-tailed North Koreans have been whipping a lot of so-called
[02:16:08] Get-American troops and may do it again.
[02:16:11] Tell them there's no secret weapon for our country but to get hard to get in there
[02:16:14] and fight.
[02:16:15] I want you to make them understand.
[02:16:18] Our country won't go on forever if we stay as soft as we are now.
[02:16:21] There won't be any America because some foreign soldier would invade us and take our
[02:16:28] women and breed a hard year race.
[02:16:30] Yeah, there you go.
[02:16:36] He's not playing around.
[02:16:37] Is it interesting that we hear the same things now?
[02:16:40] Like, America's getting soft and that's what Polar was, General Polar was saying.
[02:16:49] After the Marines had taken soul, the 8th Army of the United Nations forces had driven
[02:16:52] through the capital moving rapidly northward along the Korean coasts.
[02:16:56] To meet them, Chinese Communist armies had marched 1,800 miles northward since
[02:17:01] Migrant Mid-August.
[02:17:02] The Chinese strategist had first concentrated against the 8th Army position in the northwest
[02:17:08] and hills but when the Marines landed, they hurriedly switched much of the power to meet
[02:17:13] the meat and overwhelm them in the chosen reservoir.
[02:17:17] The Chinese drove between the Marines and the 8th Army and maneuvered into a position
[02:17:22] from which they could attack each force at will.
[02:17:27] So, podcast number 53, colders in hell is about the chosen reservoir and there's another
[02:17:37] one I forget the number but we've done two podcasts about the chosen reservoir.
[02:17:43] Listen to those.
[02:17:44] I'm going to touch on it here as well.
[02:17:48] On the hills on every side of the perimeter, Chinese fire was heavy during the day.
[02:17:52] The enemy blew a tunnel and a bridge on the railroad below, co-to-re-position, cutting
[02:17:57] the line to ham-hung and the Marine basins on the sea.
[02:18:01] For two days, Polar called in heavy air strikes upon concentrations of Chinese in the
[02:18:06] surrounding hills.
[02:18:08] Things were even worse than the two positions to the north of Polar.
[02:18:12] At least six Chinese divisions had been identified in the area where Murray and Litson
[02:18:16] Berg fought.
[02:18:18] On November 26, these two posts lost 95 dead and 543 wounded in night long attacks.
[02:18:27] Haggaru was preparing to fight for its life.
[02:18:32] An offensive launched by the fifth Marines was called off after the day's grim news from
[02:18:36] the west.
[02:18:37] The 8th Army had collapsed.
[02:18:41] One wing of it was torn to pieces and the Chinese were slashing deep into the lines.
[02:18:46] This must now defend themselves in an enemy free, against an enemy free to approach from
[02:18:52] any direction through the frozen mountains.
[02:18:57] The night of November 27 tested the men at Udomni when the three Chinese division
[02:19:04] divisions fell upon two Marine regiments.
[02:19:07] The enemy cut the road to Haggaru and sent their assault battalions in quilted uniforms
[02:19:12] and sneakers into the Marine lines with disregard for casualties.
[02:19:16] The first waves were driven off with great losses but the others were thrown into thrown
[02:19:21] in through the night and the next.
[02:19:24] To the dismay of the Chinese commanders, not even the development of Marine command post
[02:19:29] slowed the tempo of fighting and the American stage vicious counter attacks even when many
[02:19:34] platoons had been reduced to the size of squads.
[02:19:37] There were not enough tent from Marine wounded and the less seriously hurt were piled
[02:19:42] outside close together for warmth covered with straw as doctors worked over the more than
[02:19:49] 500 casualties.
[02:19:55] It now became clear that the three Marine positions in the chosen area were surrounded.
[02:20:01] Polar's reaction to the dread news was given to newspaper men who flew into Coatoree.
[02:20:07] There's what Polar said, we've been looking for the enemy for several days now, we finally
[02:20:11] found them, we're surrounded.
[02:20:14] That simplifies our problem of getting these people and killing them.
[02:20:18] Yeah, you wonder, there's no wonder why this guy's a legend.
[02:20:28] Polar prepared to open the road to Haggaru with Task Force Drysdale, a British commando
[02:20:32] unit of Royal Marines under Lieutenant Douglas Drysdale accompanied by Captain Carl Citer's
[02:20:38] company of Ridges Battalion and a company from the 31st Army Regiment which had come in.
[02:20:44] The road had been blocked in several places, two bridges were out and the Chinese squarmed
[02:20:49] on heights overlooking the route.
[02:20:53] The party met bitter opposition and within a few minutes had 14 casualties in three hours
[02:20:58] and half, three hours and a half, they moved only two miles with eight more to go.
[02:21:03] Polar sent tanks to support and men came down from the hills to walk with them.
[02:21:08] They fought through road blocks and around a blown bridge but a dusk in narrowed
[02:21:13] defile.
[02:21:14] The metronam bush and took serious casualties.
[02:21:19] By radio, Polar, Oliver Smith and Drysdale agreed that the unit must push on to Haggaru
[02:21:24] whatever the cost. The Royal Marines finally reached Haggaru perimeter at 1.30am with 90 of its 255
[02:21:32] men casualties. Citer had 63, only 70 of the 210 Army men made it.
[02:21:39] A truck column sent behind this ill-fated party was virtually destroyed after a long fight
[02:21:45] and parlay with the Chinese who captured all the trucks and most of the men.
[02:21:50] The survivors of this party were crucial to the defense of Haggaru.
[02:21:57] They're added firepower, helped turn back another massive Chinese attack.
[02:22:01] The companies of Citer and Joe Fisher killed the enemy in droves and by the next dawn,
[02:22:06] their lines, they'll bent, had held.
[02:22:09] On the night of December 7, the bulk of the division was in Polar's perimeter after the 38-hour
[02:22:22] battle from Haggaru. The cost 103 dead, 506 wounded, 7 missing.
[02:22:29] But now the force of 10,000 and its 1000 vehicles was at Citerri. The perimeter could hardly
[02:22:36] contain them all. After supper, the Colonel disappeared. Only Sergeant Jones and I haven't
[02:22:46] mentioned much about Sergeant Jones. He's like, he's, he's Polar's right hand man through this
[02:22:52] through all kinds of crazy stuff. And Sergeant Jones, only Sergeant Jones knew where he was.
[02:22:57] The old man would sneak off with Body and go up into the lines, climbing right up into those
[02:23:02] dams, straight up hills, all the ice and rock going from hold to hole for half the night. He would
[02:23:07] go to every man he could find in a fox hole and say, how you doing old man, what's your field
[02:23:11] of fire? Who's on your flank? You getting enough chow? On the way back, he would check the warming
[02:23:16] tense to see if there'd been casualties and how the men were doing. Early on December 8,
[02:23:23] the Marines began clearing the ridges on either side of the road, south, but the going was slow
[02:23:29] and the trucks bearing the bridge sections made little project progress. A funeral for 117
[02:23:36] Marines in a common grave brought the day to an end in the perimeter. It was a scene that lived
[02:23:43] in Polar's memory, the burial of frozen bodies by a tank battalion which crushed them under
[02:23:48] frozen ground. A Marine photographer took movies of the burial. Polar said, how I wish our
[02:23:55] people could have seen the site to see just what happened to us in Korea. He later heard that army
[02:24:03] censorship in Washington kept the film from the public. And now they're, again, that's very
[02:24:16] compressed story, but they're breaking out and they're heading south, getting heading back to the
[02:24:20] scene back to safety out of the out of being surrounded. Back to the book, the 5th and 7th
[02:24:27] Marines had now passed through Polar's ranks and the first was the rear guard for the entire
[02:24:31] division responsible for covering the withdrawal down the frozen loops of the road.
[02:24:36] Polar started down and hundreds of men saw him for he thought that his job had only begun.
[02:24:42] He shouted to every passing unit to cheer the men yelling until he was horse. Don't forget
[02:24:47] that your first Marines, not all the communists and hell can overrun you.
[02:25:02] When he got back, reporters found him and they wanted a statement from him. And he said,
[02:25:10] remember, whatever you write, this was no retreat. All that happened was we found more Chinese
[02:25:16] behind us than in front of us so we about faced and attacked. Smith recommended Polar for a
[02:25:29] Navy Cross for his work in the reservoir campaign. His fifth and a Marine Corps record.
[02:25:38] Polar's letter to his wife revealed his unusual concern for his family and the midst of the
[02:25:42] campaigning. Please tell Lewis that's his son. Please tell Lewis that I will finally come home
[02:25:47] and teach him how to shoot and many other things that boys and men must know. Tell him to be patient
[02:25:52] and the swords and the helmet I send him will arrive. Tell him to change his bait in the rabbit
[02:25:57] trap every few days. A piece of apple lettuce carrot celery turn up and he must not go near the
[02:26:03] trap or touch it except to change the bait when the door is sprung. Also he must keep the dog away from it.
[02:26:08] 20 still on his boy. He continues on and a letter to his wife. I haven't minded the hardships
[02:26:20] here but the killing and crippling of young men is awful. Due to the weather, our wounded die,
[02:26:25] blood plasma freezes before it can be administered. I realized that this war is for harder
[02:26:31] on you than it has beyond me than it has been on me and I'm sorry to have caused you all the worry
[02:26:37] and pain. And he goes on to say, the Pentagon is largely responsible for this mess out here.
[02:26:46] They weren't even given. They were given the money to provide us and train an army. When I entered
[02:26:52] the service, the regulation stated that the object of all military training is success in battle.
[02:27:00] This short sentence has been rewritten on three pages and I defy anyone to read over three or
[02:27:05] more times and then explained to me what the object of military training is.
[02:27:10] Even the Pentagon has not the slightest idea why they're commanding forces of the United States.
[02:27:18] In fact out here, we wonder if we are part of the United States.
[02:27:24] And here he talks about his son again telling his wife, I will not influence my son as
[02:27:29] to choosing a profession. It will be up to him. I will not even recommend the service. I've
[02:27:36] had to stand with my mouth closed on too many occasions and then carry out orders from too many
[02:27:41] half-wits. So as much as he loves the Marine Corps and the military in the country, he's saying
[02:27:50] look, I might not even, I'm not going to even recommend that my son joins. He gets his pinning of his
[02:28:02] star. Finally, he's actually being officially made a general and he makes a speech. All the credit
[02:28:07] for this star belongs to the non-combs, junior officers and enlisted men. You all know that.
[02:28:14] I've tried to do my duty, but we'd never get anywhere except for you fellows in the ranks. This is a
[02:28:20] great regimen and it's going to hurt me to leave you. I'll never forget you. To the man of task force,
[02:28:27] polar, he also issued a formal memorandum in compliance with orders. I am today leaving this command
[02:28:33] for assignment as division commander, assistant division commander. It is not without misgivings
[02:28:39] and a certain reluctance that I carry out these orders. All of you officers in mental like
[02:28:45] realize I am sure what the first Marine regimen has meant to me. I ask one more thing of you.
[02:28:52] Give my successor the same full measure of cooperation and willingness. You have always given me
[02:28:57] and the first Marines will be worthy of the name it is already one. I first commanded you on new
[02:29:04] Britain later on the bloody hills of Peleu and it has been my honor to command you in Korea
[02:29:11] where by your deeds you captured the city of Seoul then successfully covered the withdrawal of
[02:29:17] our division from the chosen reservoir area. I shall look to future to your future movements and
[02:29:25] shall expect to hear and see still greater deeds and higher reputation one on the field of battle.
[02:29:46] I talked a little bit about the dichotomy and his reputation.
[02:29:50] Pollars reputation grew among the men but Sergeant Jones noted that the old man was regarded as a
[02:29:58] man-eater. They would ask Bodian me over and over how the hell we kept our stripes. They thought he
[02:30:06] chewed on people all the time and when there was a fight recklessly exposed his people.
[02:30:12] And of course we knew better. It was hard to convince guys who had heard so much about him but didn't
[02:30:19] really know him. When you got close to him you found he had a heart as big as all outdoors.
[02:30:34] They continued to not make friends up the chain of command. We can't help to win. We can't
[02:30:40] hope to win future wars and we got the hell beat out of us in Korea unless we have discipline
[02:30:45] and it's going to take some brutality to get it. As last days in Korea we're frustrating to
[02:30:53] pull her who found things suddenly different. He wrote his wife. Now age has probably changed me.
[02:31:00] And the core has changed too. I suppose to man being what he is today. I never thought this change
[02:31:07] could or would happen. Maybe I have been wrong from the beginning. Now he gets back to America.
[02:31:20] And of course there's a big bunch of reporters waiting for him and they kind of know they kind of know
[02:31:26] he's got a mouth right so they're they're fired up to talk to him. And
[02:31:33] he starts talking to the reporters and here we go. What the American people want to do is fight
[02:31:41] a war without getting hurt. You can't do that anymore than you can go into a bar room
[02:31:47] brawl without getting hurt. Unless the American people are willing to send their sons out to
[02:31:52] fight in aggressor. There's just not going to be any United States. A bunch of foreign soldiers will
[02:31:58] take over. Air power can't live up to its billing out here. Somebody not so much the aviators as
[02:32:05] the aircraft manufacturers has sold the American people a bill of goods as to what air power can do.
[02:32:11] From what I've seen one bomb will hit a section of railroad track and 100 bombs will missed
[02:32:17] some of them by miles. The enemy puts coolies on the track with picks and shovels and in
[02:32:24] 24 hours they're rolling again. The answer is infantry. Our officer corps has had far too much
[02:32:34] schooling and far too little combat experience. They can't learn war like that. Push button
[02:32:42] war is as far off as in the days of Julius Caesar. The rifle hand grenade and bandat are still
[02:32:51] the most important weapons. We are going to lose the next war if we don't get back to them. Why
[02:32:57] half our infantry out there is still armed with carbines against the enemy with their fine Russian
[02:33:03] rifles. He then turned on the training of Marines which could be which he would soon be conducting
[02:33:10] at Camp Pendleton. We've got to get him tougher to survive for all these girls out of camp. Get
[02:33:15] rid of the ice cream and candy. Get some pride in them. That's what we need most of all. Pride.
[02:33:22] A reporter piped up. What do you think of the protest of the women's Christian temperance union
[02:33:27] over sending free beer to the troops? It's news to me, Polar said, but if a few cans of beer
[02:33:34] or snort of whiskey will make the men fight better, it might not be a bad idea. At least it's
[02:33:39] better than ice cream and all this soft training. There's too much damn recreation and military training.
[02:33:46] We should have only one purpose to fight and win. They're not being taught that now.
[02:33:57] So, he's an outspoken guy. He was astonished the next day to see the following headlines.
[02:34:03] Major general wants beer and whiskey for the troops. Ice cream, G.I.s lambasted by Polar,
[02:34:10] Marine General Blast the Air Force. The fear reached across the nation. There was actually protests
[02:34:20] against general Polar. Here's, there's, they've actually put one of these letters in the book.
[02:34:26] We hear by petition to the, to the government or to the Pentagon. We hear by petition to
[02:34:33] you to use every ounce of influence that you possess to keep Brigadier general polar from
[02:34:38] inaugurating his beer and whiskey campaign in US military training camps.
[02:34:47] But the panic did die down and he got to the business of training Marines.
[02:34:55] And in August of 1953, Polar took examinations from major general that's two star,
[02:35:01] the board which chose the new group of officers of rank approved him unanimously.
[02:35:07] In July of 1954, he was sent to Camp Ligion to lead second division. His first major
[02:35:13] peacetime troop command.
[02:35:21] There was a little, an incident, hellf issue.
[02:35:24] And one of the guys called up for general polar his wife and said brace yourself. We've taken
[02:35:29] Lewis to the hospital. They can't say what's wrong. He looks pretty sick.
[02:35:35] And he basically, he gets pretty sick. He kind of recovers from it. But the, like I said,
[02:35:47] this guy made enemies. So here we go back to the book and this is Polar talking. I could see
[02:35:52] then what the game was. They were going to retire me despite all, all the doctors had said
[02:35:58] back at Ligion. They pulled me up to Washington to get rid of me. I didn't mind retiring all that
[02:36:04] much, but the way they did it made me sore. I had all the service and honors. I needed or wanted.
[02:36:09] I'd come all the way from private to major general. But I was boiling mad about this thing. I saw
[02:36:15] lots of officers around Washington and poor condition than I was, but that wasn't going to matter.
[02:36:21] He remained in the hospital in the thested for about two weeks. After many consultations,
[02:36:26] the doctors found him unfit for duty. He wrote his wife, daily from his room on the 16th floor.
[02:36:33] Please do not worry. We must take things as they come in life. There doesn't seem much we can do
[02:36:39] to change events. So, yeah, just to tell that story a little bit more, he had like a,
[02:36:46] some got to health this. It wasn't, I don't know what it was and they didn't really seem to know
[02:36:49] what it was. But then he kind of recovered from it and he was back in his job and then they pulled
[02:36:53] him up to Bethesda and to give him a bunch of screenings and tests and see if he was fit for duty
[02:36:59] and they found that he was unfit for duty. So, that's it. That's how it ended. That's how it's
[02:37:05] career ended. A day or so before he went out, there was a party in the non-commissioned officers
[02:37:10] club on base. Polar had declined and offered from the officers club, but he could not turn down
[02:37:15] the enlisted men. It began as an intimate party, but when Polar arrived, he found a crowd of more
[02:37:21] than 5,000 who'd come to say goodbye. 20 pigs were barbecued and there was feasting and drinking
[02:37:27] until late in the night. The general made one of his shirt, Burst talks when they shouted for him
[02:37:36] and Sergeant Orville Jones remembered it. He said, only men, I'd rather be toting a rifle in a rear
[02:37:44] rank than going out now as lieutenant general. Now if you're a Marine, you're all Marine. You'll put
[02:37:51] the corps above your family, your country, even God and all else in some cases. You stick to your
[02:37:59] corps. God bless you. Polar had broken tradition to the last. It was unwritten regulation that the
[02:38:10] senior Marine officer on the post would pin Polar's third star on his shoulder as he retired,
[02:38:16] but Polar had called for Bob Norris the senior non-commissioned officer and the oldest man
[02:38:21] available who had served with him. The reporter who followed him got a formal statement. In
[02:38:29] having Sergeant Major Norris attached my third star at my retirement, I wanted to show my great
[02:38:34] admiration and appreciation to the enlisted men and junior officers of the Marine Corps. I fully
[02:38:41] realize that without the help of the enlisted men, I'd never have risen from private to lieutenant general.
[02:38:47] I've commanded everything from a squad to a division and without the help of men and junior officers,
[02:38:53] these units would never have gone forward and achieved their objective regardless of almost certain
[02:38:58] death. My only regret is that things now are, I will not be present for the next war.
[02:39:07] I also want to express my regret at the deaths of many hundreds of Marines and the crippling and
[02:39:12] maiming of other hundreds who followed me blindly into battle. Again, I would like to thank all
[02:39:21] Marines for their feelings toward me. Louis, Polar went home to Virginia. It was just 37 years,
[02:39:31] four months and two days since he had boarded the train in South Carolina. First South Carolina
[02:39:36] to exchange the uniform of a VMI cadet for that of a Marine Corps boot. But his career with the
[02:39:45] Marines wasn't quite over. Back to the book on a dimly lit night of April 8, 1956,
[02:39:55] a platoon of marine recruits at Paris Island South Carolina was marched into a title arm of
[02:40:00] broad river by 31-year-old veteran drill instructor staff sergeant Matthew C. McIllum.
[02:40:06] Six recruits drowned. The common don, General Randolph, McCall, paid immediately,
[02:40:15] relieved the commanding officer of the recruit depot and told Congress that McIllum
[02:40:20] would be punished to the full extent allowed by our uniform code of military justice.
[02:40:25] There was a nationwide outcry from the press, pulpit and scores of civic organizations.
[02:40:31] A court inquiredly, inquiry descended upon Paris Island. McIllum became a national
[02:40:37] cause to celebrate a sailed by prohibitionists as a brutal drunkard, as a symbol of military
[02:40:45] tyranny which must be destroyed, as a racist, bigot near duet. There were cries for harsh punishment,
[02:40:53] even execution. Now, he ends up going to trial and for this trial, the defense brings in
[02:41:04] Chess DiPolar, who we know believes in hard training. And here we go. This is a court scene.
[02:41:14] Burman, who's the lawyer, used the general like a master's showman, the defense desires to call
[02:41:19] to the stand of Lieutenant General Polar. Seviers, one of the lawyers, sir, how do you know the
[02:41:27] accused? Polar, I don't know him except by his pictures and the newspapers and what I've
[02:41:31] read about him. Then Burman took over and questioned the general about his careers in Marine.
[02:41:36] Burman, how long were you in Korea? Polar, about nine months.
[02:41:43] Burman, were you in combat? Yeah, were you decorated? Yeah, without going into any other,
[02:41:48] any of your other decorations, isn't it true that you've received five Navy crosses? Correct.
[02:41:55] Burman asked his opinion of the Marine Corps's mission. The definition of military training is
[02:42:01] success in battle. In my opinion, that is the only objective of military training. It wouldn't
[02:42:07] make any sense to have a military organization on the backs of the American taxpayers with any
[02:42:12] other definition. I believe that ever since I was better Marine. What is the most important element
[02:42:19] of that training? I'll quote Napoleon. He stated that the most important thing in military training
[02:42:25] is discipline. Without discipline and army becomes a mob. Now then, in that context,
[02:42:33] can you tell us whether you have an opinion based on your experience as to whether or not the training
[02:42:37] in discipline is for all situations confined to lesson plan or syllabi or training regulations?
[02:42:44] No. The training of a basic Marine is conducted almost entirely outside in the field on the
[02:42:51] drill ground, on the rifle range. That kind of work. The Marine gets an idea of how the Marine
[02:42:56] Corps's run during this training, but his training is outside work.
[02:43:00] Can you tell us general of the things you learned here as a recruit? Well, the main thing
[02:43:08] that I've remembered all my life is the definition of a spree decor.
[02:43:13] Now my definition, the definition I was taught that I've always believed in,
[02:43:17] is that a spree decor means love for one's military legion. In my case, the United States Marine
[02:43:23] Corps. I also learned that this loyalty to one's corps travels both ways up and down.
[02:43:33] And he continued through this trial. And that night, he went to the enlisted man's club
[02:43:45] and big crowd, of course, was there. And they start shouting and yelling for him to speak and
[02:43:52] find the Eastans up and says, I've talked enough for today. This will be my last request. Do your
[02:43:56] duty and the Marine Corps will be as great as it has always been for another thousand years.
[02:44:04] The applause was deafening. And he went back to his hometown of Saludah and he was not forgotten
[02:44:15] there. There he was getting interviewed by a graduate student who was trying to learn about psychology
[02:44:25] in the general said, I've never studied psychology. I had only one year of college and always thought
[02:44:30] I would go back but enlisted instead. I think the Marine Corps is the best place to learn the art of war.
[02:44:40] And then again, this reflects back people now say that America is getting soft and they
[02:44:45] are youthful. So they're saying the same thing, everything's going bad and they have a panel of
[02:44:52] experts to deal with the decline of the nation. And it's rising tide of juvenile delinquency.
[02:45:01] The consensus, the consensus was that the country was going to hell in a hand bucket.
[02:45:06] General Polar, while this big meeting is going on, General Polar stood and intended, and his
[02:45:13] intended mildness of tone as usual came forth as a brazen war. I want you people to know
[02:45:18] something, as long as we can get some decent leadership in our country, are youth to today
[02:45:22] will be better men than their fathers or grandfathers. I saw enough in Korea to make sure of that.
[02:45:28] Are four fathers at Valley Forge have been mentioned here tonight as they often are.
[02:45:33] Well, I can tell you that Valley Forge was something like a picnic compared to what your
[02:45:37] younger Americans went through at the chosen reservoir and they came out of it fine.
[02:45:41] It was never anything like 25 below zero at Valley Forge either. I admit we don't seem to have
[02:45:49] the proper leadership at the top, but there's nothing wrong with the kids today.
[02:45:53] My wife and I follow the ideas, my mother used on her kids, making them study each night
[02:45:58] after this after supper, and when they report that they have mastered their lessons,
[02:46:04] quizzing them, our children don't need to be coddled and they shouldn't be condemned. A
[02:46:10] above all for heaven's sake, let your sons alone and let them grow up to be men.
[02:46:21] It's interesting that I would say that still applies in very many ways.
[02:46:26] He also had people visiting him all the time and asking him questions and he was again.
[02:46:38] He remained a outspoken guy. I'm afraid we haven't recognized the most important lesson from
[02:46:45] Korea. The communists have developed a totally new kind of warfare, a warfare of whole peoples.
[02:46:51] And under that no modern nation can be conquered. We saw something like that in China when
[02:46:56] Japan was nibbling away at the mainland. The Japanese controlled only a square yard where a soldier stood
[02:47:02] and nothing beyond that. In Korea, the reds improved on that. This is total warfare.
[02:47:08] Yet small and scope and its design to neutralize our big nuclear weapons.
[02:47:14] Look at Vietnam, the French outnumbered the communists 2-1, yet they were massacred.
[02:47:19] If we don't design some way to meet this, they'll whip us in the end. Don't forget that regular
[02:47:24] armies have never fared well in irregular warfare. That lesson was old when Rome fell.
[02:47:32] It's amazing that he's saying this. It's just a man that the Frenchman would be,
[02:47:36] we don't think we were even in Vietnam yet. In fact, we weren't Vietnam yet when he's making these statements.
[02:47:43] We didn't pay attention to it.
[02:47:44] Finally, he goes to a, and there was some kind of a rift between him and the first Marine Division
[02:47:57] Association and they sorted out that rift and he went to a big reunion of the Marine Corps,
[02:48:05] the first Marine Division Association. Back to the book, General Smith blanked against the spotlight
[02:48:10] and turned to the blackness at the far end of the table. I now give you
[02:48:15] Chestee and the roar, the roar was so loud at drowned out the speakers' voice and shook the walls.
[02:48:22] The spotlight swung to the last place at the table to reveal polar and a linen suit waving his hand
[02:48:27] and flashing his broad crooked grin. As the clamor increased, he marched to the microphone and started
[02:48:35] in a bobbing circle of light. General Smith shouted to the tempest of the sound. I see you all
[02:48:39] know Chestee Polar. Men in the crowd danced among the tables, world each other about and pounded
[02:48:46] their neighbors on the backs, some climbed on their chairs, shouting wordlessly, tears streaming
[02:48:52] on their cheeks. Others hammered the table with Kotlery or embraced women who were staring
[02:48:59] in cregiously at Polar. The men broke into chance, we want Chestee, we want Polar. They called for a
[02:49:09] speech, but it was almost five minutes before the howling ceased. Polar faced them with a rise smile
[02:49:16] that looked as if it had been run from his face by force. When quiet returned, he grasped the microphone
[02:49:25] and called in an astonishingly penetrating voice. Marines! Pandemonium broke out once more as if he
[02:49:33] had shouted some secret watch word whose implications were known only to these men. Half the crowd
[02:49:38] was still on its feet a moment later when Polar could be heard again. If you believe the newspapers
[02:49:46] and radio is in television, our country is in a hell of a shape. I don't believe it.
[02:49:53] So long as we've got the first Marine Division, we'll be okay. The crowd shouted him in
[02:50:03] silence again. He was tired when he got home to Saluda and that evening, Virginia Polar
[02:50:12] found him pensive and destructive. Distracted. They sat on the screened porch looking out
[02:50:21] into the Virginia dusk lit by fireflies. Lewis, is there anything you'd wish for?
[02:50:29] Now that it's all over? Well, he said, I'd like to do it all over again. The whole thing.
[02:50:39] She's side. More than that. More than anything. I'd like to see the face once again
[02:50:56] of every Marine I've ever served with. And that is where this book ends. But that is not where
[02:51:20] this story ends. Because as I mentioned, and as the book mentioned,
[02:51:29] Jestie Polar had a son. And his son also became a Marine Corps officer, but his son
[02:51:39] experienced in the Marine Corps in combat. And in life was very different from his fathers.
[02:51:50] And I will tell that story in the next episode number 122, which is available now, so you can
[02:51:59] listen to it immediately. Because these stories are linked. And so we are linking them in this series
[02:52:13] of podcasts. And in the meantime, before you listen to that echo, if somebody wants to support

[02:56:45] Check and you know, speaking of subscribe and subscribing. We have a new podcast out and it's
[02:56:53] actually separate from this podcast. The new podcast is called the Warrior Kid podcast,
[02:57:00] Ask Uncle Jake. Like I said, it's a separate channel. So you have to subscribe to it separately.
[02:57:05] I did that because as you know from listening to this podcast, there's some podcasts that are
[02:57:11] for very mature audiences and you wouldn't want to have your kid listening to that, you know,
[02:57:19] a kid podcast and all of a sudden a very violent podcast comes on. So we separated them,
[02:57:26] the Warrior Kid podcast questions for Uncle Jake and I think Uncle Jake has lessons for everyone.
[02:57:34] We're going to listen to each other. Yeah. You know, I think teachers and parents and big-tem would
[02:57:40] want to listen to that as well. Yeah. Got some great feedback so far on it. So that's called the Warrior
[02:57:45] Kid podcast. And on top of that, there's a new Warrior Kid book. It's called Mark's Mission.
[02:57:50] If you actually want it, you should order it now through whatever channel you want to order it
[02:57:57] from. Go to your local bookstore, go to Amazon, go to Barnes and Noble order it. So that you
[02:58:04] have it when it comes out so that the publisher knows how many to make. Because otherwise the publisher
[02:58:09] thinks, oh, well, we won't make that many of them because there's not that many people that, you know,
[02:58:12] we're going to buy this in the wrong because you all are going to buy this. So if they don't know that,
[02:58:17] they don't make enough. It takes too long to get it once it comes out. So order it now.
[02:58:23] Other books you can order extreme ownership, combat leadership for business and life.
[02:58:30] Discipline equals freedom field manual. It's about getting after it. And actually,
[02:58:34] late afternoon, I have a new book coming out, a follow up to extreme ownership. It's called the
[02:58:39] dichotomy of leadership. It is available for preorder right now. Same thing order it now. So that
[02:58:45] you get your copy when it comes out. Otherwise, you'll be waiting.
[02:58:50] I have a leadership and management consulting company. It's called Ashilon Front. If you
[02:58:54] want information about that, go to Ashilonfront.com. We have the Master, which is a leadership
[02:58:59] conference coming up. If you want to come to it, go to extreme ownership.com. And also, if you
[02:59:06] want to attend the role call, which is for military law enforcement firefighters, paramedics,
[02:59:12] other first responders. If you want to do that, you can also sign up for the role call at extremotorship.com.
[02:59:19] And with that, as I just mentioned, these podcasts, these three podcasts that we're doing right now,
[02:59:27] are all linked. It's one big story with a thread running through it. And we are releasing them all at the
[02:59:37] same time. So the next one will be 122 and 123. Go ahead and go listen to them right now.
[02:59:46] Until then, this is echo and jockel out.
