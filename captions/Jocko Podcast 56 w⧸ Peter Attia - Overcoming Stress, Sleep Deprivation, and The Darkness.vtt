00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 56 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo.

2
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Silent screams and broken dreams. AddX, junkies, pushers and feens.

3
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Crowded spaces and sad faces never look back as the police chase us.

4
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Consumed slowly by chaos, a victim of the streets.

5
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Hungry for knowledge, but afraid to eat.

6
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Life of destruction, it seems no one cares, a man child alone with burdens to bear.

7
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Trapped in a life of crime and hate, it seems the ghetto will be my fate.

8
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:06.000
If I had just one wish, it would surely be that God would send angels to set me free.

9
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Free from the madness of a city running wild.

10
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Free from the life of a ghetto child.

11
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And that is a poem written by a young, deandre macula, a criminal drug dealer who, when he wrote that poem, was doing time.

12
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
After being one of the main subjects in a book called The Corner, which is written by David Simon and Edward Burns,

13
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
which documents the violent drug trade in Baltimore, Maryland.

14
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And that sort of morphed into an HBO series that was called The Corner as well, which paved the way for another series,

15
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
which is called The Wire, which is just an outstanding mini series that came out on HBO.

16
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But The Wire is fictional, even though it's based on kind of the same situation in Baltimore, but The Corner's real.

17
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The book The Corner's real, and it gives a very clear, any very grim view at the life of drugs and crime in the inner city, namely in Baltimore.

18
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And I'm going to go back to the book now.

19
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We can't stop it.

20
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Not with all the lawyers, guns, and money in this world.

21
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Not with guilt or morality or righteous indignation.

22
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Not with crime summits or task forces or committees.

23
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Not with policy decisions made in places that can't be seen from the lost corner of Fayette and Monroe.

24
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000
No lasting victory in the war on drugs can be bought by doubling the number of beat cops or tripling the number of prison beds.

25
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
No peace can come from Kingpin, statutes, and civil, civil forfeiture laws and warrantless searches.

26
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And whatever the hell else is about to be tossed into next year's crime bill.

27
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Down on Fayette Street, they know.

28
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Today, as on every other day, the shop will be opened by mid-morning, and the touts will be on the corners, chirping out product names as if the stuff is street legal.

29
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The runners will bring a little more of the package down, and the fiends will queue up to be served.

30
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000
A line of gaunt, passive, supplicant, stretching down the alley and around the block.

31
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000
The corner is rooted in human desire, crude and certain and immediate.

32
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And the hard truth is that all the law enforcement in the world can't mess with desire.

33
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Down at Fayette and Monroe, and every corner like it and Baltimore, the dealers and fiends have won because they are Legion.

34
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:24.000
They've won because the state of Maryland and the federal government have imprisoned thousands and arrested tens of thousands, and put maybe a hundred thousand on parole and probation roles, and still it isn't close to enough.

35
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
By raw demographics, the men and women of the corners can claim victory.

36
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:44.000
In Baltimore alone, a city of fewer than 700,000 souls, with some of the highest recorded rates of intravenous drug use in the nation, they are 50, perhaps 60,000 strong.

37
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Three of them available for every prison bed in the entire state of Maryland.

38
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:58.000
The slingers are manning more than 100 open air corners serving up the product as fast as they can get it off the southbound metro liner.

39
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And the fiends are chasing down that blast 24-7.

40
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:16.000
In neighborhoods with where no other wealth exists, they've constructed an economic engine so powerful that they'll readily sacrifice everything to it.

41
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And make no mistake, that engine is humming, no slacking profit margins, no recessions, no bad quarterly reports, no layoffs, no naturalized unemployment rate.

42
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Get it straight, they're not just out here to sling and shoot drugs.

43
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:44.000
In drug markets, in cities across the nation, lives without any obvious justification are given definition through a simple self-sustaining capitalism.

44
00:05:44.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The corner has a place for them every last soul, doubts, runners, lookouts, mules, stick up boys, stash dealers, and forces, fiends, burn artists, police snitches, all necessary in the world of the corner.

45
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Each is to be used, abused, and ultimately devoured with unfailing precision.

46
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000
It's about the fiends, thousands of them who want that good dope, they need it.

47
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
The way other souls need to breathe air.

48
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.000
It's about the slingers, the young crews working the packages, all of them willing to trade a morality that they've never seen or felt for a fleeting moment.

49
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:48.000
They're working the package with the hidden knowledge that they will fall, that with rear exception, the money won't last, and the ride will be over in six months, or four, or three.

50
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Violence.

51
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Violence is no longer the prerogative of the professional, but a function of impulse and emotion.

52
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:12.000
The contract killers and the well-planned assassinations of earlier eras are mere myth on these corners.

53
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Now, the moment a truth generally comes down to some man-child with hurt feelings waving a 38 around spraying bullets up and down the block.

54
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:32.000
The accidental shooting of bystandards is now commonplace.

55
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Even 15-year-old hoppers have loaded 38's hidden in the alley.

56
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:49.000
The job is a little better than a death wish.

57
00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:04.000
In the end, the corner best serves the hard core, the junkyard dogs with neither the time nor the inclination for pity.

58
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
The corner proves itself every day.

59
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.000
It destroys whatever it touches.

60
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And eventually, the corner destroyed DeAndre, McCullough.

61
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Even though he received the second chance in his life, and he actually got to play a small role in that series that came out on HBO, the wire.

62
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.000
He got some other jobs in the entertainment industry as well, but the corner called them back.

63
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And that guy, DeAndre, who wrote that poem, he ended up dead over heroin overdose in 2012 at the age of 35.

64
00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Now, there's a reason I'm bringing all this up, and that is because we have a guest tonight.

65
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:09.000
A guest that is actually more responsible for this podcast than anyone, and we'll get to that later.

66
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
But his name is Peter Atia.

67
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And he grew up a boxer, been a long distance, and during South Leigh,

68
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:28.000
got his degree in medical engineering and applied mathematics, and then got his doctorate as an MD from Stanford.

69
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And it is residency in surgery.

70
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And the reason that I started off this whole talk about the corner is because he did that residency at a place called John Hopkins Hospital,

71
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
which is about three miles from the actual corner of Fayette, Monroe Street.

72
00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:06.000
The war zone that's pictured in the book, the place where DeAndre, McCullo lived, and where violence was, and in many ways still is just a part of life.

73
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And Peter was at Ground Zero in the war zone.

74
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And saw more darkness and suffering probably than any person should have to, and learned a lot from it.

75
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And we're going to get to that in a bit. But first of all, Peter Atia, welcome to the show.

76
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Thank you for having me, sir.

77
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Glad to have you on finally.

78
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And you grew up. We'll get right into it.

79
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
You grew up, tell us a little bit about just growing up. You grew up in Canada.

80
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000
You know, you've covered, if for those of you that hadn't listened to the Tim Ferriss interview with you, listen to him, what does that three of them?

81
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Yeah, I think there's three of them. You can listen to those and get more details on Peter, his whole background.

82
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
But for those that are just listening right now, you grew up in Canada, gives a little, little statement about that.

83
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:17.000
I grew up in Toronto. You know, immigrant parents, so grew up, you know, sort of in the wonderful lower middle class, not the best suburb of Toronto.

84
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.000
It's Toronto, like New York has five boroughs. Four of them are nice. One of them is not. I grew up in the one that's not so nice.

85
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And meaning it's just a dump. I don't know how to like, it's, you know, it's not like a war zone or anything.

86
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And I have lived now in the United States for about half my life. So I high school in college was in Canada and then everything from Med School beyond has been here.

87
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And I am now a dual citizen of the town.

88
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
How did that transition work? Because you didn't, you obviously applied mathematics degree.

89
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And then you worked in the civilian world a little while with that degree, right?

90
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:05.000
So my plan was always to do a PhD in aerospace engineering. And so that's why I did the mechanical engineering and applied math.

91
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:14.000
I did the two things for undergrad got it. And then was sort of just in the almost about ready to go and start that PhD in aerospace.

92
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And then I had just a complete change of heart and decided I wanted to go into medicine.

93
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:28.000
So that, so what I had to do for a year then was you got to take this thing called the M cat, which of course I didn't have any of the courses to take it.

94
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
So I had to sort of teach myself the chemistry and biology that summer took the M cat.

95
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
But then I still have a lot of times that's what I do in the summer time. I'll teach myself you.

96
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Yeah, chemistry and biology.

97
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Yeah, I didn't do that well.

98
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And then I had to do what's called a post back year where you go back in the process of applying to medical school without actually having the courses to get in.

99
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So if you get in it's conditional.

100
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And so that year because I'd already graduated, I just taught calculus.

101
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.000
So I was like a, you know, adjunct lecture at the university and taught calculus, which I always enjoyed.

102
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
I mean, because I taught it for a couple years before.

103
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And so that's why you're waiting to get into medical applying and then and getting my courses like I forget what I had to take biology and psychology biochemistry.

104
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I'd to take a few prerequisites to get it because in engineering and math I'd never taken a single course.

105
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000
In fact, the day before I took the M cat, this, this is only going to be funny for geeks who get biology.

106
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So I'll, okay, I'll find a moment.

107
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
But that won't be made.

108
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Yeah, I'm studying for the M cat this summer that I'm supposed to take the test and the whole time I'm studying.

109
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
I'm like, you know, I can't believe how sloppy these textbooks are.

110
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
They keep confusing myosis and my toesus.

111
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Like why can't they just spell it the same way both times?

112
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Like they, I didn't realize that it was two separate things, right?

113
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Myocies is when a cell separates.

114
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Separate spirits and they.

115
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
But doesn't replicate its DNA.

116
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
My toesies is when it creates an equal copy.

117
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And I literally not until the day before the M cat realized that those were two separate things.

118
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And that's how how how clueless I was going into this test.

119
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Yeah, and it was a lucky reason I knew that was because I was helping one of my daughter study for their biology something.

120
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Yeah, anybody who took any biology course should know that.

121
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
But I hadn't taken any.

122
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
So it's like you get in medical.

123
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Yeah.

124
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
You go there.

125
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
What's that?

126
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Four years?

127
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Another four years of school.

128
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Uh-huh.

129
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And then you get done with that.

130
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And now it's time to do your residency.

131
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So, you know, do you get to pick where you're going to go?

132
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Not sort of.

133
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
So it's a funny system called the match system.

134
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
So when you're in your.

135
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Yes, you're beginning your fourth year of medical school.

136
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
By that point, you have to figure out what you want to do.

137
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Do you want to be a surgeon?

138
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Do you want to be an internist?

139
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Do you want to be a pediatrician or radiologist?

140
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Whatever you want to do.

141
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Because all of those have different programs.

142
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And then you have to apply to those programs.

143
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So let's say you wanted to do orthopedic surgery.

144
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
You would send out your application to all the orthopedic programs in the country.

145
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Hopefully you'd get interviews to a good number of them.

146
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
You'd go do the interviews.

147
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And then you would submit to a match system, a rank order, of the places you'd want to go.

148
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And you don't put something on there that you don't want to take.

149
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
So if you.

150
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
If you.

151
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
You know, if you applied to 30 programs, you got interviewed at 15 and you liked 10.

152
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
You rank those 10 in order.

153
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Similarly, the programs after they interview everybody do the same exercise.

154
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And they do the rank.

155
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And then a computer matches you one to one.

156
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
That's actually pretty square to a.

157
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Yeah, so you.

158
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
The only way you're going to guarantee you know where you're going is rank one program and hope you get it.

159
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:49.000
So in my case, I think I ranked five programs.

160
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And I ranked Johns Hopkins first for surgery.

161
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And I'm not because I wanted to live in Baltimore though, in many ways, I think it was a blessing to do so.

162
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
But you know, because.

163
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
At the time, I don't know that this is true today, but at the time it was probably the best general surgery training program in the country.

164
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And that was a combination of two things.

165
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
One is you had these kind of legendary surgeons there that had pioneered.

166
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Some of the most complicated.

167
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
What are called hepatobiliary surgeries, surgeons, you know, surgery of the pancreas and the liver and stuff like that.

168
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
But at the same time as you alluded to, it was in a war zone.

169
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
And so the other aspect of training to be a good surgeon is having great exposure to penetrating trauma.

170
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
So trauma, you always want to divide into blunt and penetrating.

171
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Blunt trauma is not often operative.

172
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
So people that get hit by cars and things like that.

173
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
You know, ends up being more orthopedic.

174
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
But if you're a general surgeon and you need to be able to cut open the chest and the abdomen and things like that.

175
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
It's penetrating trauma.

176
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
It's it's you want knife and gunfight.

177
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Not that you want it. But that's that's the training ground to be in.

178
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
So and and sort of Baltimore would have been, you know, probably in the top five.

179
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
What year was this?

180
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
2001.

181
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
2001. Yeah.

182
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
2000.

183
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Okay.

184
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And when you were what was it?

185
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
What was the thing that slipped or this is going backwards a little bit?

186
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
What was the thing that transitioned in your mind?

187
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Were you all the sudden one?

188
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Do medicine?

189
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Well, yeah, it's funny.

190
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I don't know if I've ever talked about this publicly.

191
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:29.000
So when I was in engineering school, I in my second year I started doing some volunteer work.

192
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:36.000
And I this the reason why is too complicated, but I started volunteering with.

193
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Some kids that were in a in a shelter that had been abused.

194
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
So it was a home for sexually abused kids.

195
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
And that got me interested in sort of volunteering in a hospital.

196
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:53.000
So I was volunteering at a hospital that had you know, it was a pediatric cancer ward.

197
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
So you would just sort of, you know, you'd go up there and you'd kind of hang out with kids and just play with them and stuff like that.

198
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000
And so between that experience and then I was still doing this volunteer work with these kids who had been sexually abused.

199
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
A lot of those kids were suicidal.

200
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
So I also found myself in the hospital a lot with these kids after they attempted to kill themselves.

201
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:19.000
And I think somewhere in my senior year of engineering, I kind of had this, you know, I don't know what the word is.

202
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
I don't think it's an existential crisis as much as maybe a nervous breakdown.

203
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
But just a bunch of things were kind of going on probably some undiagnosed psychiatric issues on my part.

204
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:39.000
But I realized like, I love engineering and math intellectually, but there's no emotional connection outside of the joy of solving a problem,

205
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
which by the way is probably plenty enough.

206
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
But I wondered if there was something else that I'd be more interested in that could scratch two inches, right?

207
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
It could scratch sort of the intellectual inch, but also maybe an emotional inch.

208
00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And so I spent the majority of my senior year thinking about, was there something else I ought to do?

209
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
But I'd been successful in my undergrad, so it was sort of a given that, you know, if you're going to graduate at the top of your class,

210
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
you're going to go off and do the best PhD program.

211
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
So at the very end, when I sort of declined to do that and I turned down a bunch of scholarships,

212
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
it seemed a little odd that I would go and do medicine.

213
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
But that's really the reason it was kind of this epiphany I had one day actually,

214
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
while I was in the hospital when I was sort of had this.

215
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Actually it's really funny, we just moved as we were talking about earlier.

216
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
And one of the things moving is great for is cleaning up stuff.

217
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:41.000
And I actually found my essay that I wrote when I applied to medical school back in, you know, whatever, 95 or 96.

218
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
And it was really interesting to go back and read the story because it's exactly kind of how I remembered it, right,

219
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
which was like this moment I had this sort of insight that this is what I wanted to do.

220
00:19:49.000 --> 00:20:00.000
So, so that's kind of the series of events that led me to have that seemingly or thog and all change in direction.

221
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Okay, so now you go through that, you end up, you get your accepted do you residency at John Hopkins, you show up there.

222
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
What's that like?

223
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Well, I remember when I interviewed at Hopkins for medical school as well,

224
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
and I was lucky enough to get in there for medical school.

225
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
And at the time, I think Hopkins was technically the best medical school in the country.

226
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:29.000
I think it was Harvard and Hopkins where the best two and Stanford was, you know, maybe third, fourth, fifth.

227
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
But I remember when I interviewed there for medical school at the end of the interview,

228
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
like I had to spend the night there.

229
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
And so they put us up in the dorms for the med students, which is great idea you get to meet your upper classmates.

230
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
And I remember I said that Friday night, I said, hey, I'm going to go walk down to the harbor.

231
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
It's like a mile and a half down the road and they're like, oh no, no, you can't do that.

232
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
I said, what do you mean?

233
00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:00.000
They said, you can't walk outside of the hospital. And then they pointed out that on every corner, there was like a booth with an armed guard.

234
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
There's a guard in full armor with an automatic weapon.

235
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
And so I remember the time thinking, yeah, I probably don't want to go here for med school.

236
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000
So, and of course, Stanford sort of for a guy who'd never been to California and who'd lived in miserable cold weather as whole life.

237
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
I was like, it could have been a hundred-thranked medical school.

238
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
I was still going there.

239
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
So, I have some actual stats that I pulled up.

240
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000
So, war zone in 1993, there was 48 murders for every hundred thousand people.

241
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
There's what's seven hundred thousand in the city.

242
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
The next highest was in 2015, 55.

243
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000
And in 1993, again, there was 353 homeless sides, homicides.

244
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Yeah, almost one a day.

245
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
And so, you know, I have to put this in there.

246
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Because we're sitting here calling it a war zone. So, when I was in Ramadi in 2006, the one one AD,

247
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
which is the Ready First Brigade, you know, five thousand, six hundred soldiers,

248
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
while we were there with them for six months, they lost 61 guys.

249
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000
So, what I'm saying is, now, that doesn't count the enemy casualties.

250
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Yeah.

251
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
But it counts the friendly casualties that are showing up at our med center.

252
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Right?

253
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
There, you know, you're talking three or four hundred, well, you just said one a day.

254
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Yeah, about one a day.

255
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Okay. So, so you knew how bad it was when you got, well, you know, I sort of knew it was dangerous.

256
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
But I think when I decided that, you know, for this, that season of my life,

257
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
you got to sacrifice everything, and you got to go to the place where you're going to get the best training.

258
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
And I didn't want to leave California because, you know, four years in California,

259
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
for the first time was, you know, when you know, you guys know what it's like.

260
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Yeah.

261
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
I mean, it was like, I don't ever want to leave this place.

262
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
But I also knew I just couldn't get that level of training on the west coast.

263
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
And it was, you know, you basically had to go to a place like Hopkins,

264
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Bergman, Wobbans, in Boston, maybe Wash U, in St. Louis,

265
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
was going to offer a very similar environment.

266
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
So then, you know, so then I ended up ranking it first.

267
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
They ranked me first.

268
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
So away, we go, we get lucky.

269
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
We get a very good match made in heaven. And that's like kind of February of your senior year.

270
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
And then reality sits in, which is you've got sort of four months until you have to show up.

271
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
And that was kind of like the, oh, shit moment, right?

272
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Like that I really just signed up for this.

273
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
And a good friend of mine who was two years ahead of me in medical school.

274
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
His name is Brian Donham. He's now a pediatric head and neck,

275
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
and at Chopin Philadelphia. He was at Hopkins, which was at the time the best earnosen throat program in the country.

276
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
And he actually recommended I read this book, the corner.

277
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Because, and Brian's one of these guys who's just, you know, he's just, he's like a Renaissance man,

278
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
you know, like not only is a great surgeon, he's like a gifted artist.

279
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
He has side job as medical illustration.

280
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Like you can't believe what this guy can do.

281
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
But he's introspective, right? And he was, he said, look, you know,

282
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
you're, you're going to sign up to be in this war zone.

283
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000
And you're going to be taking care of people that it's going to be very easy to despise.

284
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:21.000
So he said, you need to read this book to gain a sense of their perspective.

285
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Because very, like I said, you know, so at the time, I can't remember the stats.

286
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
I feel like at the time that I was there, we averaged about 16 penetrating traumas a day.

287
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Now to put that in perspective, in general, surgery, your on call every second to every fourth night.

288
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
So average about every third. I mean, every third night, 120 times a year.

289
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000
You will spend the night in the hospital, not sleeping, waiting to take care of any trauma patient.

290
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
So if every third day and night, you know, 16 of these people are getting shot and stabbed,

291
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
you're going to have a lot of time in the ER in the trauma bay, dealing with that.

292
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
And it's really easy to get jaded really quickly.

293
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
It's fun for the first month. And then all of a sudden, every time somebody gets shot,

294
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
it's preventing you from sleeping.

295
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Which when we're sitting here all well rested, sounds like a very callous thing to say,

296
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
but all of a sudden, you're sort of like, damn it, man.

297
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
I can't eat because the trauma page or just went off again.

298
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000
To this day, I still eat shockingly fast, and it drives my wife nuts.

299
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
But she doesn't understand. I said, I think it's just, I'm a victim of you never know

300
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
when you're going to have to stop what you're doing, and that might be your last meal.

301
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Even I shave quickly because the worst thing that could happen is you got shaving cream all over

302
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
and the trauma page goes off and you've got to run down half shaved.

303
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
You got one side of your beard down on the other side.

304
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
That's a stupid thing like that.

305
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
So that was Brian's recommendation.

306
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000
So I got the book immediately, devoured it, found it to be the most depressing thing I had ever had.

307
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
It is heavy.

308
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
It's heavy.

309
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
They've made more depressing by the fact that they pulled no punches.

310
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
No names are changed.

311
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
So every person you read about, you are reading about it and a completely unsensored, unfiltered way.

312
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And I mean, you read it.

313
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
You're not going to have to be happy about this book.

314
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
You just finish it and you think, yes, you have more empathy than you understand

315
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
where these folks are going to be coming from.

316
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
It's not like you finished that book and go, ah, here's the solution.

317
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.20
We need a six point plan that's going to do X1.

318
00:26:25.20 --> 00:26:26.30
It's like I don't actually.

319
00:26:26.30 --> 00:26:29.000
That's kind of why I read that one excerpt.

320
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
We can't win, which is an awful thought.

321
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
And that's what that's the impression the book gives you.

322
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
It's we can't win.

323
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
And I don't that the way you phrase it of being like,

324
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
it doesn't matter how many police and whatever you do,

325
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
you're going against human desire.

326
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Well, the stat that you reiterated, and I remember it very well

327
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
from when I read this book the first time was,

328
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
you couldn't take every junkie and put them away.

329
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
If you took every federal and state prison bed in Maryland,

330
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
you'd have three people for it.

331
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
If you just looked at the users, never mind the guns,

332
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
the money, and everything that comes with it.

333
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
So yeah, that's not a solution.

334
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Now, there's a second reason that I don't think Brian knew,

335
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
because I don't think anybody knew that that book really hit home,

336
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
which it sounds tangential to this story,

337
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
but it becomes highly related.

338
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000
At the beginning of end of my third year of medical school,

339
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
I'm going to the gym one day, ride my bike,

340
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000
as I always do.

341
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
I get off my bike, go to lock it up,

342
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
and I was like, my back really hurts.

343
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Really hurt.

344
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Not like, oh, it's a little stiff.

345
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Something feels horrible.

346
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
So I started walking down the steps to the gym,

347
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
and I was like, not gonna happen today.

348
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
I couldn't do anything, I couldn't time my shoot.

349
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
So I just went back, got on my bike,

350
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
rode back to my apartment, told my roommate,

351
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
I was like, hey man, I'm gonna go lay down upstairs.

352
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
The next morning I woke up, I couldn't get out of bed,

353
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
and to make a very long story short,

354
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
over the next two weeks, I completely deteriorated.

355
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
You know, I was at the point where I could get in and go to the hospital,

356
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
but I had to have the nurses,

357
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
this is back in the Wild West days,

358
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
where you could just sort of get anything you needed at the pharmacy.

359
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
You know, I'd get nurses or residents to inject

360
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
or all into me, which is a really strong end said,

361
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000
I could only sleep if I laid in an L shape over the nurse's station.

362
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
And it just wasn't getting any better.

363
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
And then one day, it pain changed immediately.

364
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
I realized in retrospect what happened, a herniated disc had fragmented broken off,

365
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
so the pain in my back dissipated,

366
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
but now I had this, what turned out to be a 4 centimeter fragment,

367
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
sitting on my S1 nerve root.

368
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
So now it felt like my left foot was being skinned from the bottom.

369
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
But that was constant, so that was an unrelenting pain,

370
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
and it could only be sort of brought under control,

371
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
if I could put my foot into a bag of ice,

372
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
because then I could make my foot go numb,

373
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
and then I could take some pain medicine.

374
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
So this one, on for another week, and then the Dean of the Medical School,

375
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
saw me limp in through the hospital,

376
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
he said, what's wrong?

377
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
And I told him, and he dragged me down to the ER,

378
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
we got an MRI that showed all of this.

379
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
And I was in surgery the next morning.

380
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
This was a Sunday night, Monday morning,

381
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000
I'm in the OR.

382
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
It turned into a disaster.

383
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
The guy who operated on me, I prayed on the wrong side.

384
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
So I woke up.

385
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
The left issue was still present,

386
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
but now I had what's called a foot drop on the right side.

387
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
So foot drop is when the nerve that holds your foot up,

388
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
which we take for granted when we walk.

389
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
But if you don't have the ability to what's called dorsiflex,

390
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
your foot would drop, you can't walk,

391
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
you'll end up dragging your toe when you keep tripping.

392
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
This story, I mean, we could spend three hours on the story,

393
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
because it's so idiotic.

394
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
The punch line is I eventually needed many trips back

395
00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
to the operating room.

396
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
This guy refused to believe there's anything wrong with me.

397
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000
It took another amazing doctor and neurologist

398
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
to actually intervene on my behalf.

399
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
And three months later, I'm unable to walk.

400
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
I'm unable to do anything.

401
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
My mom actually had to fly down from Toronto to look after me.

402
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
And I'm sort of, you go through the checklist, right?

403
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
So there's, I don't know if you've ever heard of Elizabeth Kubler Ross.

404
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
I don't think she's alive anymore, but she wrote a very famous book

405
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
on the stages of dying.

406
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
And it goes through anger and denial and finally acceptance at the end, right?

407
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
And so you know bargaining, it's something that would make sense if you,

408
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
and I'm sure you've heard of that.

409
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
And you've probably watched it on really small scales.

410
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
In combat, you might see these things over the course of compressed.

411
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Yeah, with a cancer patient, you might see this stretched out over a year.

412
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
And so I was kind of going through this on my own, right?

413
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
We're initially, it was like, oh my god,

414
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
what if I don't finish this rotation I'm doing right now?

415
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
I'm going to be a surgical sub-internship to, well,

416
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
what if I don't graduate on time?

417
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
To, what if I can't be a surgeon?

418
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
And then it was, what if I don't walk ever again?

419
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
So somewhere along the way, I don't remember exactly when,

420
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
probably like a month and a half into this.

421
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
I finally caved in and started taking pain medicine.

422
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
I thought that's where this story was going.

423
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
I was like, at some point, he's going to get on the open.

424
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Yep. And I had been so reluctant to do so initially.

425
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Been so stoic, you know, just taking my NSAIDs and even using

426
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Benadryl, which is a horrible pain medication, of course,

427
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
but it sedates you through some of the pain.

428
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
And so I, you know, started taking per cassette.

429
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
And per cassette is, it's typically 10 milligrams of oxycodone.

430
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
So oxycodone is the fast acting version.

431
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
It's stronger than say a vik so a vikodin is Tylenol and hydrocodone.

432
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Immediate acting, but hydrocodone is not as strong as oxycodone.

433
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
So per cassette is stronger than vikodin.

434
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
They both have Tylenol. It's just the opiate is stronger.

435
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
And so, you know, if you take a per cassette,

436
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
which would have 500 milligrams of Tylenol and 10 milligrams of oxycodone,

437
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
you know, I probably was taking, you know,

438
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
you start taking two, three, four, five, six of those a day.

439
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
You develop a tolerance.

440
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:36.000
And eventually, there's a long-aracting version called oxycontin,

441
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
which is just a time-released version of oxycodone.

442
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
So then you would take that twice a day.

443
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000
So at my peak, I was probably taking 80 milligrams of oxycontin a day,

444
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
plus another 120 milligrams of oxycodone.

445
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
I just got rid of the Tylenol altogether.

446
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
You can just get straight oxycodone.

447
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
And so I'm about 200 milligrams a day of oxycodone.

448
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Equivalent. And again, if I took that today,

449
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
I would just die of you just not breathing.

450
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
But at the time, you know, you build up this tolerance.

451
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
But it also, there was this point where I realized

452
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
that I wasn't just taking it for the physical pain.

453
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Right? And I think this is the single most important insight I had

454
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
that when coupled with reading that book, six months later,

455
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
was the, I think the single most important realization I ever had

456
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
with respect to this problem,

457
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
which was, at some point it was, I was just so depressed

458
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
that I couldn't walk. And I was so worried that, you know,

459
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
I'd never be able to do anything again,

460
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
that at least the drug gave me a high that took me away from that.

461
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
And so then it got to the point where I was just taking that drug

462
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
all the time, and I just stopped engaging,

463
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
like, wasn't engaged with anyone anything.

464
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
And then I sort of had this realization that that was happening.

465
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
And I was like, I want to stop.

466
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
So at the time I was dating this girl,

467
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
she was an anesthesiology resident. She was a few years older than me.

468
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Just the coolest, coolest person.

469
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
And I said to her, she was kind of the only one that knew what was going on.

470
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Because at the time, even the doctors who were prescribing this,

471
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
like, this just wasn't on people's radar as a problem back then.

472
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
I think today people would be like,

473
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
homeboy's got 200 milligrams of oxycon today.

474
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
That's probably not good, but at the time it was just like,

475
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
it was like, tick tax, right?

476
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
So that would legitimately kill it.

477
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
If I took 200 milligrams with that, that would really jack someone up.

478
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
I would think, I think if I took 200 today, I would stop breathing.

479
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Yeah, because that's how opiates kill you.

480
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
They repress, they inhibit respiratory drive.

481
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Whenever someone overdoses on heroin, they just stop breathing.

482
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
So yeah, I think 200 would, I don't know.

483
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
We'd have to, I'd have to look at the farmed one.

484
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
We don't have to actually, you have to stay here one before that.

485
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
So the girl you're eating.

486
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
She said, you can't just stop, right?

487
00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
The withdrawal is so painful that you have to taper off.

488
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
You have to probably go on methadone,

489
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
and then you'd have to start some pretty potent anti-depressants.

490
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
They, like, M-A-O-I's or T-C-A,

491
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
so you have to go on a drug like nor trip to lean,

492
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
which is an end of itself kind of a crazy thing.

493
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
And I was like, yeah, but I think I'm just going to stop cold turkey.

494
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Now, unlike alcohol, so if you took an alcoholic,

495
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
you know, you took someone who's drinking 20 alcohol,

496
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
you know, alcohol beverages a day,

497
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
and they've been doing that forever.

498
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
And you stop them, they will die.

499
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
They will get something called delirium trements,

500
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
and they will die a horrible cardiac death.

501
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
They will break into a rhythm,

502
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
and they will die.

503
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
So when we had alcoholics in the hospital,

504
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
let's say we had to operate on somebody who happened to be an alcoholic,

505
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
we would actually just put them on an ethanol IV.

506
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
We weren't even trying to detox them.

507
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
We just wanted to make sure they didn't die,

508
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
and go into these delirium trements.

509
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
But heroin and opiate is not like that.

510
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
It is not physiologically lethal to stop cold turkey.

511
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
It's just unbearable.

512
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
And so I was like, I'm going to do it.

513
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
So against her better judgment,

514
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
I just stopped one day.

515
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
And she could not have been more right.

516
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
It was the darkest.

517
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
I mean, I got laughed about it now.

518
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000
It was the darkest month of my life.

519
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
It was a month?

520
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
Oh, at least.

521
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000
I mean, it was, I would just sit on a park bench

522
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
for the whole afternoon,

523
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
like complete flat affect.

524
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
But it's all mental.

525
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
It's not a physical thing.

526
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
No, there's physical stuff going on.

527
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
I mean, but, but no, it's,

528
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
yeah, you, you, you sort of like, you know,

529
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
opiate's make you itch like crazy.

530
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
You get constipated.

531
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
So there's like a reversal of a whole bunch of physical stuff.

532
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
But the biggest thing is the craving and the depression.

533
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:55.000
And so the depression of coming off this thing was brutal.

534
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
In many ways, and I don't tell that story to say,

535
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000
well, look at how special I am that I detox.

536
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000
That's not a point at all.

537
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
I had two things going for me that virtually no junkie has going for them, right?

538
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
The first is, I didn't have a network of people around me

539
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
that we're doing the same thing.

540
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
So I was sort of the only guy doing it.

541
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
So for me to go and be around my friends was to be around people who weren't doing this.

542
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
We always used to joke that if you really want to kick a heroin head,

543
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
but you have to get a whole bunch of new friends.

544
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Like you, you don't get to decide you're not doing heroin,

545
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
and then go back and hang with your friends that are doing heroin.

546
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
You need to watch trainspotting to learn that.

547
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
The second thing, and perhaps the more important thing,

548
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
is I finally did connect with a doctor who was able to put me on the right path.

549
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
So I, I had ended up going back to the operating room.

550
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Probably a half a dozen times over the course of the year

551
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
to have, all these problems corrected.

552
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
And then I found something else to fixate on, which was physical therapy.

553
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
So I started to, you know, even though it didn't seem like exercise,

554
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
it wouldn't seem like exercise today at the time.

555
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
It was the first activity I was able to do.

556
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
And so, you know, within six months, I could like walk

557
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
like a reasonable distance again.

558
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
And so I would be spending three hours a day at physical therapy

559
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
just doing like the most trivial exercises.

560
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
But basically the root cause of my depression was getting better.

561
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
So that's really the only reason I think I was able to kind of detox off this stuff.

562
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Whereas I think for many people,

563
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
hey, it's not clear what the root cause is or be.

564
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000
It's not getting better if it is clear.

565
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
And so that's why I think it's really, it's a brutal addiction.

566
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
And it seems like also you had a future.

567
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Right, you had a life, you were in medical school.

568
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000
You're going to, you know, you're, yes, I think there's a lot of these people

569
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
that are drug addicts.

570
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
What do they, they have no life that they're looking forward to.

571
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
They're just looking forward to it.

572
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Absolutely.

573
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
And so in February of that senior year when I had to submit my rank list,

574
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000
I think we match in March and Misspoke earlier,

575
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
I was still not functional perfectly.

576
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Like there was no way in February of 2001 that I could have with

577
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
the statistical residency.

578
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
But I had to make a decision at that point,

579
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
which was will I be ready on July 1st.

580
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
And if I won't be, I should not submit my rank.

581
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
I should defer a year, sit out of your medical school, whatever.

582
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
And I remember that was the hardest decision I'd to make.

583
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
And I just gamble.

584
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
I was like, you know what, I'm going to be ready.

585
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
And I'm going to make it happen no matter what.

586
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
And so I submitted, matched, and then in addition to now reading the

587
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
corner to prepare for Baltimore and reflecting on my own sort of

588
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
struggle with addiction, which was completely fresh in my mind.

589
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
I'm also like rehabbing like it's my day job.

590
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
And going through like, and I,

591
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
most people take the last quarter and med school off,

592
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
but I didn't have the ability to do that now because

593
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
I had to go straight through till graduation day because I'd missed so much

594
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
time during my injury.

595
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
So when I showed up in Baltimore a couple of days before July 1st,

596
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
I mean, it still wasn't crystal clear to me that I could go,

597
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
you know, two days without sleeping, standing in an OR for eight

598
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
hours at a time, all those sorts of things.

599
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Now, that's one of the things, the sleep deprivation,

600
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
because people always, obviously, I take a lot of slack because I don't sleep

601
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
a lot and the sleep deprivation.

602
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
So what did that, but what's that like when you're going through residency?

603
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
And you're just saying, I mean, there's days where you're going 24,

604
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000
48 hours, no sleep, and how did that affect you?

605
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000
What did you think of that?

606
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
What do you think looking back at it?

607
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
What's your opinion of it now?

608
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Well, you know, when I decided that I was going to go in the surgery,

609
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
I mean, I always, I'm pretty insecure in general.

610
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Most people don't necessarily appreciate that on the outside, but always thinking,

611
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
I don't know if I've got what it takes, your how do I figure it out.

612
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000
And so my whole MO in life is test the system hard.

613
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
So when I was in medical school, still deciding this, I figured, well,

614
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
every Thursday night, I'm going to pull an all nighter in my room,

615
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:57.000
standing up, not allowing myself to eat, sleep, drink, pee, do anything,

616
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
and I'm going to stand up my desk for eight hours and practice suturing.

617
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
You know, sort of try to mimic what it would be like to be an operating room all night,

618
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000
not being able to go pee, not being able to drink, not being able to do this thing.

619
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
And so I had a little bit of confidence, you know, I figured, okay, I can do this.

620
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Like I can pull an all nighter once a week, that's, you know,

621
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
not that that's a good thing to do, but it was like kind of a confidence thing.

622
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Right.

623
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
So then you show up, but there's no preparing you for what you're in store for.

624
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Now, I got to point out, this is not the way it is anymore.

625
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
So in 2000, I want to say like four.

626
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
It's like labor laws came in.

627
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Exactly.

628
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.000
A whole bunch of laws came in that we could spend hours talking about how it turns out the laws haven't.

629
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000
They haven't fixed the underlying reproblem, but nevertheless,

630
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
a whole bunch of work requirement hours stuff got fixed, right?

631
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000
So you couldn't work more than 80 hours in a week or 88,

632
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
depending on if your program had an exemption,

633
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
and you couldn't work more than 24 hours consecutively and stuff like that.

634
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
But by the time those laws really kicked in, I was already gone.

635
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
And so I don't really know what it's like today,

636
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.000
but I would imagine it's less demanding from a sleep deprivation standpoint.

637
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
But at the time, there were no such rules,

638
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
and you were at the sort of every second, every third,

639
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000
every third, every fourth night call, but then your post called day, you would still work.

640
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000
So our mutual friend Kirk Parsley, which of course is how we met,

641
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000
this is one of his favorite stories about me.

642
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000
He loves this story, because it's so crazy.

643
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000
So this is July of 2001.

644
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000
So I am one month into being a doc, right?

645
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
And I'm on an every third night call rotation at this hospital called Bayview,

646
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
which is about five miles from what we call the mothership,

647
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
which is Hopkins.

648
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
And it's out in like East Baltimore.

649
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
It's in a real crappy part town, not that there's a real, I mean,

650
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000
I hate saying this, but I don't,

651
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000
there aren't that many good parts of town, at least back then,

652
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
and Baltimore.

653
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000
And so I'm, so I show up on a Monday at five o'clock in the morning.

654
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
So I slept in my own bed Sunday night.

655
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
So Monday morning, I show up at five to round.

656
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
We do our whole thing.

657
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000
And that night I'm supposed to go home.

658
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000
So that's my off call.

659
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000
As you call your swing day, you show up at five.

660
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000
You'll be home by seven p.m. that night, if all goes well.

661
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
So you worked your, you know, 14 hours,

662
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000
and then you sleep in your own bed,

663
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
and then you get to come back the next day,

664
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
and then you're going to be on call.

665
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
So we're rounding that afternoon.

666
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
So, and the, one of the senior residents says,

667
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000
hey, so and so didn't show up for their shift in the ER.

668
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
The ER always staffs one surgical resident full time.

669
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
And this guy just didn't show up.

670
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
And she's like, and it's a seven p.m.

671
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
to seven a.m.

672
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Shift.

673
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Can you cover it?

674
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
And you know, this would be like,

675
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
if you asked the most junior guy, you know,

676
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
to do something like, he, he'd be kicking his own ass to say yes.

677
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Like, he couldn't wait to do that, right?

678
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000
So I was like, hell, yes, I will do that.

679
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
So then I go down to the ER,

680
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
and I work all night, seven to seven.

681
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
And then the next morning is now my on call day.

682
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
So now I'm seven a.m.

683
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
cranking away until that night,

684
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
and then I'm up all night on call.

685
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000
So, and then it's now Wednesday,

686
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
and it's my post call day,

687
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000
and I'm there till five or six p.m.

688
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000
So I've basically been up from about four a.m. Monday,

689
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000
and it's now five or six p.m. Wednesday.

690
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
And I get in my car to drive home,

691
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000
and I have to make it,

692
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
I have to go down this miserable street called Eastern Avenue

693
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
to hit the 83 to drive up to my place.

694
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
And I'm driving along Eastern Avenue,

695
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000
which is like red light after red light after red light,

696
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
or stop sign or whatever,

697
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
and every time I met a stop light,

698
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
I fall asleep, my foot pops off the clutch,

699
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000
and I stall.

700
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Like, I am so tired,

701
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000
I can't even handle the gradual easing off the clutch

702
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000
and the gas just to move up and up.

703
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
I can't do it.

704
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
So finally, in one moment of lucid clarity,

705
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
I'm like, you can't get on the freeway,

706
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
you're gonna die.

707
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
So it's like, what's the solution?

708
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
I was like, you gotta get over and take a nap.

709
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000
So I pull over my car on the side of Eastern Avenue,

710
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000
right in front of this park called Patterson Park,

711
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
which at the time,

712
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000
I don't think I fully understood that that was an open air drug traffic market.

713
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
So I got up, but here's the best part, sorry.

714
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000
The logical thing to do would have been just been stayed in the car

715
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
and taken a nap.

716
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
But I was like, I haven't seen the sunlight in like days

717
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
and it's the sun is still out.

718
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Like, I'm gonna go nap in the park.

719
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
So I get out of the park,

720
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
I'm in green scrubs that are covered in blood stains

721
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
because I was too dumb to not change.

722
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
I go laid out in the park,

723
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
I take my page off and I clip it

724
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
to my neck and I set the alarm to go off in one hour.

725
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
There's like seven p.m.

726
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
It'll wake me up and I'll feel perfectly rest

727
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
and I'll be able to drive home.

728
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
So I laid out in middle of Patterson Park.

729
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000
And the next thing I know I wake up,

730
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000
it's like one in the morning, two in the morning.

731
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
There's needles everywhere.

732
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
There's, I have like a bites on my arm

733
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
that look like they're from rats

734
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
because they're nothing I've ever seen before.

735
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Like these bites all over me.

736
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
And I'm just thinking myself like,

737
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
how did I not get killed here?

738
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Like the only thing that prevented me from dying

739
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
was how ridiculous the site was.

740
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
You know, if something's so strange,

741
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000
like not, you know,

742
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
so I was like God damn it man.

743
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
So I get back in my car and drove home.

744
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
And when I tell Parsley that story,

745
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000
he loves it because he's like,

746
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
that's the classic example of how

747
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
complete deprivation of sleep

748
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
and pairs your judgment.

749
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
So, you know,

750
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000
there were a couple stories in residency

751
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
where I had to do like those three night

752
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000
back to back to back to back.

753
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Another time it happened,

754
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000
I remember was in an O5.

755
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
Do you feel like though, okay,

756
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
driving a car is kind of boring, right?

757
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Stop lights.

758
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000
But when you're really tired,

759
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
but then all of a sudden something happens.

760
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Like boom, I feel like when that happens,

761
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000
I feel like in lock on,

762
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000
there's almost no amount of sleep deprivation

763
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000
that will stop me from functioning

764
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000
and getting something done that's important

765
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
on task, on time.

766
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Absolutely.

767
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Is that true?

768
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
I think so, yeah.

769
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000
No, I think in adrenaline rush

770
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000
in the moment.

771
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
I've been able to provide any amount of

772
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
clarity and focus that's necessary.

773
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
The problem is very few things are life or death that way.

774
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Now in your world,

775
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000
there were plenty of things.

776
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000
But in my world, not.

777
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000
And this is the extra,

778
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
I was going to tell was,

779
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000
in probably my third year,

780
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000
I think it was my third year.

781
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
I was the same sort of deal.

782
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
I ended up covering for somebody

783
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
and then covering for two people

784
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000
and two consecutive nights

785
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000
and then it was my turn.

786
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
So, that was like three straight nights

787
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000
of not sleeping.

788
00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000
And it's the middle of the night,

789
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
and this guy comes in the ER

790
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000
who's got a really diseased gall bladder

791
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000
and in retrospect,

792
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000
it should have never come out that night.

793
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
But a lot of times,

794
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000
the dirty little secret is surgeons

795
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000
want to operate at night

796
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
because they can get better OAR time

797
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
electively as opposed to waiting the next day

798
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000
if it's not emergent.

799
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000
So, sure enough,

800
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000
we're in the middle of the operating room

801
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000
doing a laparoscopic gall bladder removal

802
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000
at two in the morning

803
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000
when we don't really need to be there

804
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.000
at two in the morning.

805
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000
We could have slept

806
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000
at the next day.

807
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.000
And sure enough,

808
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000
so in a lapar,

809
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
removing a gall bladder is a two surgeon procedure.

810
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
So, there's the main surgeon,

811
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000
which because we're teaching hospital,

812
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000
I'm the main surgeon.

813
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000
I'm actually doing the operation

814
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000
and then there's the attending

815
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
who's holding the camera

816
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000
and retracting for me.

817
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000
So, I'm doing this.

818
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000
And yeah,

819
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000
that's a stimulating activity,

820
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.000
but of course,

821
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000
I've done a hundred of them,

822
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000
so it's not that stimulating.

823
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000
Well, I can't stay awake.

824
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000
And I finally somehow managed

825
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
to fall asleep on this patient.

826
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Like, I faced plant into the patient.

827
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Luckily, it was laparoscopic,

828
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
so I didn't contaminate the surgical.

829
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000
But so,

830
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
even something is stimulating is surgery.

831
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Because if the guy's aorta was bleeding,

832
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000
I'm just like,

833
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000
I would've said,

834
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000
yeah, exactly.

835
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000
But now,

836
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000
I was like,

837
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:14.000
yeah,

838
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000
when I was gallbladder's no big thing,

839
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000
yeah,

840
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:16.000
yeah,

841
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000
it wasn't stimulating enough

842
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000
to overcome three days of sleep debt.

843
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Did you figure out any tricks

844
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000
or any, you know,

845
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000
for instance,

846
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000
when I was going through cell training,

847
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000
and even my whole career,

848
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000
and even to this day,

849
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000
I take little power now,

850
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000
so if I'm feeling that tired,

851
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000
I elevate my feet,

852
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000
and I sleep for like six to eight minutes,

853
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
and it totally returged me.

854
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Did you take power now?

855
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000
No.

856
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Aside from your power now,

857
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000
you have a seat.

858
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:42.000
You have a seat.

859
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000
I was in seven hours,

860
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
and almost got as you killed.

861
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.000
I did.

862
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
I once took a power nap in my car.

863
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Again, same thing.

864
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
It was like eight o'clock at night.

865
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.000
I got to the pool.

866
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000
I had a rule,

867
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000
which was after you left the hospital.

868
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000
You never went home.

869
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Because I knew if I went home,

870
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000
I wasn't going to leave.

871
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
So I would always go from the hospital

872
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000
to the gym,

873
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000
or the pool,

874
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000
or whatever I was doing.

875
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000
And on this particular night,

876
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000
I get there.

877
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000
It's eight o'clock at night.

878
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000
I am so tired.

879
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000
I'm nauseous.

880
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Like the thought.

881
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000
So you didn't want to go home

882
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000
just because you knew you'd go home.

883
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000
I thought it was a sleep.

884
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:11.000
I thought it was a sleep.

885
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000
You didn't want to go to sleep,

886
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.000
because you've been awake for three days.

887
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Why didn't you want to go home?

888
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Why didn't you want to go home?

889
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Well, because I was really funny.

890
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000
I got a friend of mine who again,

891
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000
a couple years ahead of me,

892
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000
gave me interesting advice.

893
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000
Whether it was right or wrong.

894
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000
I don't know.

895
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000
He said,

896
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.000
you're going to be tired,

897
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000
no matter what in residency.

898
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Don't stop doing all the other things in your life.

899
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000
Because you'll still be tired.

900
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000
Now,

901
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000
I don't know that that was the right advice.

902
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.000
But I took it hard.

903
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000
I thought advice.

904
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000
And on my view was,

905
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
I'm going to continue to work out.

906
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Every day,

907
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000
I'm not on call.

908
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000
I'm going to do all the stuff I want to do.

909
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000
So yeah,

910
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.000
so it would be to the pool.

911
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000
And so same thing,

912
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000
I got there.

913
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000
But on this particular night,

914
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000
I was so tired.

915
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
I was so nauseous.

916
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
I couldn't suppress the desired vomit.

917
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000
And I was like,

918
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:55.000
I'm not going to,

919
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000
if I puking the pool,

920
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000
they'll kick me out.

921
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000
I won't get this one.

922
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000
It's just not going to be worth it.

923
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000
So I was like,

924
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000
just sit here for like 30 minutes

925
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000
and take a quick nap.

926
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000
So same thing took the page right,

927
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
which normally could wake me up.

928
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Clip it here.

929
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000
And it was freezing,

930
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000
because there was like the winter.

931
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000
So I left.

932
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000
No,

933
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
it wasn't cold.

934
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
But I remember wanting to leave the radio on.

935
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000
I like a dumbass.

936
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
So the car is off.

937
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000
So alternator is off.

938
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Radios on.

939
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000
What, you know how the story ends?

940
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000
I wake up at 2 in the morning.

941
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Batteries dead.

942
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000
I'm in the middle of the parking lot.

943
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.000
I can't, you know.

944
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Had to call my girlfriend to get jumper cables to get me out.

945
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000
That's a one that girlfriend went on to become my wife.

946
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000
So short answer.

947
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000
No,

948
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000
I didn't have a great strategy.

949
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000
I did have a friend who,

950
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
and I never tried this.

951
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000
But he told me he would put coffee grounds in his eyelids.

952
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Apparently it hurts so much that you put in closer eyes.

953
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Okay.

954
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000
You know, that's, I mean,

955
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000
I would not that, but I've told people this all the time too.

956
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000
You know, do do a little bit of physical exercise.

957
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000
If you're super tired,

958
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000
that definitely picks you back up.

959
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000
There's got to be some reality or some scientific reason for that.

960
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000
Happening.

961
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000
That's another thing you can do.

962
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000
But,

963
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000
so you are so okay.

964
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.000
We know it sucks.

965
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000
You're not sleeping and you're dealing with these patients.

966
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000
And, and how do you start to

967
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
detach

968
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000
from this reality that's around you?

969
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
So you're not getting, you know,

970
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.000
you, you, you said already you like the kind of the emotional involvement with people.

971
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.000
But then at the same time,

972
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.000
you said it didn't take long before you despise these patients that are coming in.

973
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Because they're interrupting your sleep and bothering you.

974
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.000
That's got to be a crazy balance to try and strike as a human being.

975
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.000
I mean, human beings are not meant to be dealing with

976
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
16 puncture wounds a day.

977
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.000
That's, that's not right.

978
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000
So what, what happens in your brain?

979
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000
What happened in your mind?

980
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.000
What did you notice about your mentality and this whole business as time went on?

981
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Well,

982
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000
what I noticed,

983
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000
so again,

984
00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000
not everybody becomes jaded,

985
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000
but most people do.

986
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
And where where my sense of jaded

987
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000
developed was actually towards, you know,

988
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000
the patients of diabetes,

989
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.000
the patients who had complications from being overweight.

990
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000
Like when those people would show up with, you know,

991
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
the abscess and their foot in the middle of the night that needed to be

992
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000
debrided,

993
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000
those people I would get, again,

994
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
pretty pissed at.

995
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Amazingly,

996
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.000
the,

997
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000
the,

998
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:24.000
you know,

999
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000
these, these trauma folks,

1000
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000
like I kind of always maintained a soft spot in my heart for them.

1001
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000
And interestingly,

1002
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000
you know,

1003
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000
it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, once they die,

1004
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
you know, so what happens is like,

1005
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000
let's say a guy comes in,

1006
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.000
you guys been shot.

1007
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.000
You know, generally people who are dead in the field don't make it in.

1008
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000
So, so, but, but sometimes there's this gray zone where,

1009
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000
you know,

1010
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
someone comes in who's basically dead,

1011
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000
but because they had a little bit of a pulse on the way in the door,

1012
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
like we're going to do everything we can.

1013
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000
But a lot of times when those patients die,

1014
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000
like the room has to be turned over really quickly,

1015
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000
which means someone's got to come in,

1016
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000
take the body, put it in a body bag,

1017
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000
gather everything because usually these are criminal investigations.

1018
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000
So the police are there,

1019
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.000
the housekeeping staff has to come in and mop all the blood off the floor,

1020
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
because depending on where the gunshot wound was,

1021
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000
like gunshot wound at the head, for example,

1022
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.000
tons of blood,

1023
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000
because the head's a confined space.

1024
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Um,

1025
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.000
and in that moment,

1026
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000
it's really easy to just immediately walk out the door,

1027
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000
but I find myself, you know,

1028
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:24.000
I, I'd,

1029
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000
I'd sometimes like flip through their wallets,

1030
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000
right?

1031
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000
And,

1032
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000
you know,

1033
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000
invariably you'd see something like you'd see a picture of a little kid.

1034
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000
So you,

1035
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000
you see this guy who's huge,

1036
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.000
who's just been killed,

1037
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
he's probably 25,

1038
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000
and you'd see like this six year old girl in his wallet.

1039
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000
And you, you know,

1040
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000
you'd start to sort of wonder what the narrative is, right?

1041
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Like,

1042
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000
was that his daughter?

1043
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Probably.

1044
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Did he know her?

1045
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Probably.

1046
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000
Did she know him?

1047
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Maybe not.

1048
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000
Like, you just don't know.

1049
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000
And all of a sudden,

1050
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000
that's, that's sort of humanizes these,

1051
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
these guys.

1052
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
And, and again,

1053
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000
I think because of my own understanding of what they were dealing with,

1054
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
because of those 16 penetrating traumas,

1055
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000
15 had to be drug involved,

1056
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
in one way or another.

1057
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.000
And so everybody who we're taking care of for the most part,

1058
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000
was some part of the cycle that's being described in the corner.

1059
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
Now occasionally it wouldn't be.

1060
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.000
I mean,

1061
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
one of the examples that stands out that was,

1062
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000
I would say sort of like,

1063
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.000
a top five saddest things I ever saw in residency

1064
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000
was July 1st, 2002.

1065
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000
I just happen to remember that day

1066
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000
and this girl on her 16 years old,

1067
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000
she was a girl on her 16th birthday,

1068
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000
came in and she was just,

1069
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000
she was just hit by a stray bullet in her neighborhood.

1070
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000
It was her 16th birthday,

1071
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000
stray bullet from,

1072
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.000
you know, unrelated gang violence,

1073
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000
hit her in the head.

1074
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000
And, you know,

1075
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000
she's an example of someone who came in

1076
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000
basically dead,

1077
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000
but in situations like that,

1078
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000
like, you know,

1079
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000
I'm sure you can relate to this.

1080
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
You're just going to do something that's so,

1081
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000
beyond her road.

1082
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000
You want to do anything and everything to try to save her.

1083
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000
And of course, we couldn't.

1084
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000
So, you know,

1085
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000
those examples are kind of rare,

1086
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.000
but the majority of the times,

1087
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.000
it's, you know,

1088
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000
executions for people who stole money.

1089
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000
That's,

1090
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
those would be hard to see, right,

1091
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.000
because you could,

1092
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000
these girls, you know,

1093
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000
this is like,

1094
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000
this is a deadly game.

1095
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000
No, even the,

1096
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000
even the girl,

1097
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000
the 16-year-old girl,

1098
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000
she's part of the cycle too,

1099
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.000
because that's a stray bullet.

1100
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000
That's right.

1101
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.000
She's in a,

1102
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.000
she's in a lousy neighborhood.

1103
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.000
You can almost guarantee that,

1104
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000
you know,

1105
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000
if she's living in where she's living,

1106
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.000
to get hit by a stray bullet,

1107
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.000
like, you know,

1108
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000
she wasn't living in,

1109
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:22.000
you know,

1110
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Roland Park.

1111
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000
And,

1112
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000
and when, once you did,

1113
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:27.000
did you,

1114
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000
would you ever see any family?

1115
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
Would any family ever come in?

1116
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000
Yeah,

1117
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
so there's two types of things going on, right?

1118
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000
So, so,

1119
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.000
the,

1120
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.000
the biggest,

1121
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.000
problem we would have

1122
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000
would be real gang on gang stuff,

1123
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000
because,

1124
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000
it became sort of a feed forward loop, right?

1125
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000
So, if one guy came in and he was killed,

1126
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000
you immediately knew the floodgates were going to open,

1127
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000
because there's going to be retaliation that night.

1128
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000
I don't remember that the police were pretty,

1129
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000
good about trying to,

1130
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000
make sure that,

1131
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000
like, when someone came in and who was killed,

1132
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
like, if you weren't immediate family,

1133
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.000
you were not allowed there.

1134
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000
And they also tried to create a little bit of a delay

1135
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000
and letting that information out.

1136
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.000
Again,

1137
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000
maybe that wasn't the,

1138
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000
the,

1139
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000
the most considerate thing to do,

1140
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000
but their view was trying to let the violence dissipate.

1141
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Um,

1142
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000
yeah,

1143
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000
the family stuff's hard.

1144
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:20.000
I mean,

1145
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
the hardest family interaction I ever had

1146
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
with it was with actually a blunt trauma,

1147
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000
and it wasn't involving drugs at all, right?

1148
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.000
This was a,

1149
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.000
this was,

1150
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000
um,

1151
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000
a boy.

1152
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
He was 15 years old.

1153
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000
He and his brother,

1154
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000
his older brother,

1155
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000
who was probably 18,

1156
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000
had picked him up after school.

1157
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000
They were driving home.

1158
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000
And they were,

1159
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000
they had the right away,

1160
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
and a guy ran a red light

1161
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.000
and teaboneed them on the passenger side.

1162
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.000
And this,

1163
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000
the 15 year old boy,

1164
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
the older boy came in as an adult trauma.

1165
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000
So he went to the adult side.

1166
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
I happened to be on pediatric surgery.

1167
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
Like I was the senior resident on pediatric surgery

1168
00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.000
that month.

1169
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.000
So I ran the pediatric trauma,

1170
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.000
which is where the 15 year old came in.

1171
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
And that turned out that older,

1172
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000
the driving sun was fine.

1173
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000
He didn't have a scratching on his body.

1174
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.000
But this kid came in,

1175
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000
basically dead on arrival.

1176
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000
Though it wasn't clear why,

1177
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
but his pupils were blown,

1178
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000
um,

1179
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000
you know,

1180
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000
little bit of a pulse,

1181
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000
we did,

1182
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000
you know,

1183
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.000
probably 30 minutes of everything imaginable

1184
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000
before accepting the reality

1185
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.000
that he cheered his Aorta.

1186
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000
So if a high enough force

1187
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.000
can actually shear the Aorta

1188
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.000
and it dishexed,

1189
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000
and you basically bleed to death

1190
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
inside the wall of the Aorta.

1191
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.000
And that's why he died.

1192
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.000
And that was another example of how

1193
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.000
everybody just sort of scatters after that.

1194
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000
But you know,

1195
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
his mom is in a waiting room,

1196
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
wondering where her boys are,

1197
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000
who,

1198
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.000
you know,

1199
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000
could have been an offender

1200
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000
for all she knows.

1201
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.000
So,

1202
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000
those were,

1203
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000
I mean,

1204
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000
unquestionably the most difficult

1205
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000
discussions ever,

1206
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
because trauma is the one area

1207
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000
where there's complete surprise.

1208
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Like,

1209
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000
you know,

1210
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.000
it's tragic when somebody dies from cancer.

1211
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000
It's even tragic when somebody dies

1212
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000
during an elective surgical operation,

1213
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000
which happens,

1214
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.000
unfortunately, in the meantime.

1215
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.000
But at least there,

1216
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.000
you have some heads up

1217
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
that's something dangerous is going on.

1218
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000
But this kid,

1219
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000
like,

1220
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.000
you know,

1221
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000
said goodbye to his mom that day,

1222
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000
went to school and never came back.

1223
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000
And now she hears,

1224
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000
oh,

1225
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000
he's in a car accident,

1226
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.000
and she's in the hospital,

1227
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000
never imagining that he could be dead.

1228
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
And then you have to be the guy that goes in and say,

1229
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.000
you know,

1230
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000
I'm really sorry to tell you this,

1231
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000
but your son is dead.

1232
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.000
You know,

1233
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000
there's actually a really interesting,

1234
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000
article written in The New York Times

1235
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000
on this exact topic,

1236
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000
but I'm an interesting story.

1237
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000
So my mentor in medical school

1238
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:46.000
to this day,

1239
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000
one of the closest mentors I've ever had

1240
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000
as a guy by the name of Steve Rosenberg.

1241
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.000
So Steve Rosenberg is the chief of surgery

1242
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000
at the National Cancer Institute.

1243
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000
And he's kind of one of the luminaries

1244
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.000
in immunotherapy.

1245
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
So I did my postdoc with him at the NIH.

1246
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
And I actually spent time there in medical school,

1247
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
and actually he just called me yesterday

1248
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
out of the blue.

1249
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
We didn't have to have a great catch up for 30 minutes.

1250
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
His daughter,

1251
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
his three daughters, his youngest daughter,

1252
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
is Naomi Rosenberg,

1253
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
who's a resident at,

1254
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
and I think she's an emergency room doc at Penn,

1255
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
which is also when a war zone in Philly,

1256
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
and she wrote a great piece on this,

1257
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
which maybe we could link to in the notes or something.

1258
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
It's probably like the last three months

1259
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
about the difficulty of having to communicate

1260
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
to families when tragedies like this happen,

1261
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
which of course you should see a lot of as well in Philly.

1262
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
And then that happens.

1263
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000
So you do everything you can to save this kid's life.

1264
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
And then you walk in,

1265
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
you face the mother,

1266
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
you drop the most devastating,

1267
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
possible, imaginable news on her.

1268
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
And you gotta go back to work.

1269
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
I mean, right?

1270
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I mean, don't you then have to,

1271
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
you have to go work again now.

1272
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Yeah, that night in particular,

1273
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
that was, that was,

1274
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I remember that day pretty well.

1275
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000
That was April of 2003 when that boy died.

1276
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.000
And by the time we had declared time of death,

1277
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
and I had gone to talk to his mom,

1278
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
it was probably like 10 o'clock at night.

1279
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
You know, I probably spent an hour with her.

1280
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
And of course it's disruptive because you're in there

1281
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
and your page is going off.

1282
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
I've got the ER calling me about this kid,

1283
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I've got the ICU calling me about this.

1284
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
And she's, you know,

1285
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
I mean, like, I gotta,

1286
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I gotta sure hope I never have to know what she went through,

1287
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
because I can't, can't really imagine, right?

1288
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
I mean, she's hysterical at a level that you just,

1289
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
like a movie doesn't do justice to that.

1290
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Like you don't see that level of hysteria normally.

1291
01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000
And I, that was certainly like one of kind of the three or four

1292
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
that really upset me the most.

1293
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I mean, I, I had a real hard time,

1294
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
and I think I got lucky that night.

1295
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I think that night and that I'd be in a pretty calm night.

1296
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I remember I got to probably spend some time

1297
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
just alone in a calm room that evening, you know.

1298
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And, and for me that was,

1299
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
so the, this is the awful thing here.

1300
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
We tend to project what's going on in our own life

1301
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
into any situation.

1302
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I mean, I, I think I realized that pretty early.

1303
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
And so I think in the case of that particular trauma,

1304
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I saw in that boy, my brother.

1305
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
My brother, my younger brother.

1306
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
And so I, so I was dealing with two things in that moment.

1307
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
One was,

1308
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000
meaning from my own and not, not the immediate issue,

1309
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
which is this boy died.

1310
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
One is, I'm imagining now like this could be me

1311
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
and my brother in high school.

1312
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Like this could have been us.

1313
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
And how, how your life changes after that.

1314
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Like I thought his brother's life is never going to be the same.

1315
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000
The second was, this was already after I had decided

1316
01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
to leave medicine altogether.

1317
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Which was in June of 2006.

1318
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000
And this, this trauma was like April of 2006.

1319
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000
So I've decided in March of that year that I was just going to finish that year and then leave.

1320
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
So, so the other thing that was sort of that I was struggling with,

1321
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
which probably makes this a little heavier than it needed to be,

1322
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
was,

1323
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
as painful as this is,

1324
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
it's a privilege to be this person.

1325
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
It's a privilege to be the guy who gets to try to save a life.

1326
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
And even when you fail,

1327
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
that interaction you're going to have with that family,

1328
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
which I think is something Naomi wrote about in that piece.

1329
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
It's so important.

1330
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
It seems trivial to us because you have that interaction over and over and over again.

1331
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
But to that family, it's so important.

1332
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
That will be with them forever.

1333
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
And I think I felt that that was a privilege.

1334
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
And so I think I realized like, I'll never do this again.

1335
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
I'll never again have that privilege to,

1336
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
even if I fail to try to, you know, sort of say somebody to actually then be able to,

1337
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
comfort that family.

1338
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
And that sounds really weird.

1339
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
It's a very morose sort of thought to have.

1340
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
But all of those things, I think, in that particular example,

1341
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:13.000
you know, made for a really difficult set of, you know, days and weeks at fall.

1342
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
And I went to his funeral.

1343
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
First patient I ever went to a funeral of a first trauma patient.

1344
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Certainly went to the funeral's of patients.

1345
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
You've got to know through, you know, people were dying of cancer and stuff.

1346
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
But, you know, trauma patient, like you just wouldn't think to go to someone's funeral

1347
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000
that you'd never known because like, I'd never known that boy, right?

1348
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I stayed in touch with his mom for a few years and not surprisingly,

1349
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
their life just completely fell apart, you know.

1350
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Does it make it that much worse that you got this,

1351
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.000
you juxtaposed the kind of this normal kid, right?

1352
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Who dies this random accident?

1353
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.000
And then at the same time every night, you've got people that are killing each other.

1354
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000
And you're seeing the results of that and you can't do anything about it.

1355
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:05.000
How does that also play into your thoughts about, hey,

1356
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I'm here trying to save these people's lives and they're out there killing each other.

1357
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
For over nothing, over the street corner, over this, over that.

1358
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Did you go down that road mentally?

1359
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Not there. I'll tell you the one time I felt really ethically,

1360
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
maybe ethically, it's too strong, a word, but just to be blunt.

1361
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
I mean, the one time I was really pissed off that I was trying to save somebody's life

1362
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:34.000
was a guy that came in who killed his wife, killed his daughter,

1363
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:41.000
and then put the gun in his under his chin and pulled the trigger and missed.

1364
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
So he basically blew off the side of his face and was still alive.

1365
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
His brain was completely intact.

1366
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.000
This guy was going to survive after 23 face operations.

1367
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.000
And I'm taking care of this guy and the ICU and I'm kind of pissed off about it actually.

1368
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
And maybe I shouldn't be, who am I to judge this guy?

1369
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.000
But I'm like, you killed your wife, you killed your kid and you wanted to die.

1370
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Why the hell am I putting anything into you?

1371
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Now, of course, that is a slippery slope because in medicine we're never supposed to play that role.

1372
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000
We're never, we never play God.

1373
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
People, some doctors want to act like they're playing God, but we never play God.

1374
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
We're just there to do a job.

1375
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
And on that day, I remember thinking, I got to do this job.

1376
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I don't want to take care of this guy.

1377
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
I want this guy to die actually.

1378
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
How do they address that when you're going to medical school?

1379
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
That whole idea.

1380
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
They've got to cover it out.

1381
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Or is it just so underlying the underlying theme of everything you do

1382
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
at the time you get done?

1383
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
It's there.

1384
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
That's a really good question.

1385
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I don't know.

1386
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Are there ethics classes in medical school that teach you that?

1387
01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
I am sure there are.

1388
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
The fact that I can't tell you one thing about an ethics class, I took, tells you it's

1389
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:04.000
that whatever ethics you have are going to be independent of whatever class you're taking.

1390
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
And who knows, today, these pendulum swing from one end to the other.

1391
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
For all I know, you know, half the curriculum could be ethics today.

1392
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
I don't know.

1393
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000
But the short answer is I think, you know, it's sort of internal.

1394
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
And the reality is, you know, if you're in a good program and the one thing I'll say,

1395
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I mean, as much as Hopkins was a brutal place to exist.

1396
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
The camaraderie there was unbelievable.

1397
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I mean, you know, the nickname for the residence was the Hallstead Marines, right?

1398
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Which, again, doesn't do justice to real Marines,

1399
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
but that was sort of the camaraderie, right?

1400
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
It was like you would do anything for your, you know,

1401
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000
that's why you'd always volunteered to stay up three nights to help somebody else out.

1402
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
And so, you know, I had really great friends there.

1403
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
In fact, to this day, like some of my closest friends, people that I'm in touch with

1404
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000
almost every day were guys I went through that experience with.

1405
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
And you could talk about those things with each other, right?

1406
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I mean, you know, it was okay to say, like, I really wish this mother fucker would die.

1407
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Because he's taking up a bed.

1408
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
He's costing the state a million bucks.

1409
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
And I hate him.

1410
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:19.000
And I somehow being able to talk about that, I think, makes it a little bit easier, right?

1411
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Well, absolutely.

1412
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
I mean, any, that's what happens in the military.

1413
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000
You get guys that go through tough situations, tough battles,

1414
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
and they, they become closer going through it.

1415
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
And part of the thing that brings them closer together is to your talking about what's going on.

1416
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Has it happening and after it happens?

1417
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
What did you,

1418
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I mean, I think that's what I'm talking about.

1419
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000
So a lot of times in this podcast, I say that this podcast,

1420
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:49.000
yeah, we talk about war and we talk about leadership and we talk about history.

1421
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000
But I find that the actual root of what the podcast becomes about is,

1422
01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:01.000
is really about human nature and what people, what human beings are like.

1423
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Was there, I'll give you both sides of this question, did you learn anything about people about human nature?

1424
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.000
There, that was surprisingly positive.

1425
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000
And before you answer that one, did you learn anything about human nature while you were there?

1426
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:24.000
That was surprisingly negative.

1427
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000
So, so I'll give you one thing that I learned that I don't know that I would call positive or negative,

1428
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000
but it was an observation that in retrospect seems obvious,

1429
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000
but it never would have, I never would have thought of it before and to this day,

1430
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
it still serves me well to understand it.

1431
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:50.000
So the first observation is that when you look at a significant illness,

1432
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:56.000
like a completely disruptive insult, you know, cancer,

1433
01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:02.000
you have pancreatic cancer, which means you're going to die, and you're going to die soon.

1434
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000
There are two types of families that come into that situation.

1435
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000
So families that show up already fractured get blown apart.

1436
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Fractures that, for families that show up already tight become the tithest of any family.

1437
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.000
The same would be true when you see a kid that comes in, a burn victim,

1438
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:31.000
right, this kid that gets burned badly on the 4th of July, and this kid's going to spend the next two months in the hospital.

1439
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000
You know, a couple that comes in with tension already in their marriage,

1440
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
they get splintered wide open.

1441
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.000
If they came in and everything was fine, they're going to be there for each other.

1442
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
They're going to be tighter.

1443
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
So that was an observation that I just saw over and over and over again.

1444
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:53.000
And I saw it in probably even more vivid color when I was at the NIH,

1445
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
because the two years I was there, you know, as mostly doing research,

1446
01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:04.000
but you still had clinical responsibilities, and so you're basically seeing patients who are coming to receive experimental therapy for cancer.

1447
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000
So these are patients who are all, you know, otherwise going to die within six months.

1448
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000
And most of them will still go on to die, obviously, the subset of them we can help,

1449
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
but you're seeing that over and over again.

1450
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
So that was the first observation.

1451
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And then the second was that there were just a couple of residents who I couldn't believe how amazing they could be,

1452
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.000
who how they could never sort of do the wrong thing.

1453
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
So there were two residents in particular.

1454
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000
One really, he was, he, his name is Chris Sondende.

1455
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000
He is now a, he's a transplant surgeon at the University of Michigan, amazing guy.

1456
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:49.000
And so Chris was two years ahead of me. And I mean, he was like that guy that I would have done anything for.

1457
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000
And I remember when I was leaving, thinking to myself, you know,

1458
01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:01.000
I'm really glad I'm leaving because if I stayed, I'd know I could never be as good as Chris.

1459
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Like that, like how can someone be this good?

1460
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000
And I don't mean, like he can sew this good and cut, I don't mean even medically.

1461
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Good human being. Just as exactly as a human being.

1462
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000
He is on a level. I can't get to.

1463
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:26.000
And, you know, I don't know anybody else who can get there either, but the fact that I can't get there is a little upsetting to me.

1464
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
And I'm glad I don't have to spend the rest of my life chasing him.

1465
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Which of course, Chris would never think of it that way.

1466
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Because that's the nature of being that guy as you, he's just completely humble, modest, unassuming guy,

1467
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
who just happens to be a guy.

1468
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:49.000
You know, it's going back to the first point that you mentioned, and it's something that I've heard people talk about as well.

1469
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:56.000
My buddy's talk about is, you know, the whole idea of post-traumatic stress and all that.

1470
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
And what war does to people?

1471
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
And one thing that I happen to agree with is pretty similar to what you're saying.

1472
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:15.000
And what is going into the war, right? If the person is got a good stable mindset and a good attitude and is a positive person,

1473
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
and they're going to come out of it with all those good positive things amplified.

1474
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.000
They're going to be more positive. They're going to be stronger. They're going to be mentally tougher.

1475
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000
It's the people that go into it that are already somehow fractured.

1476
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Those fractures are going to get worse through the trauma of combat.

1477
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:39.000
This is a broad generalization. And there's definitely great guys that see things or do things that they, that it hurts.

1478
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And it takes them a while to get through it.

1479
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000
But there's also some guys you go, you know, that guy was messed up when we showed up.

1480
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000
And now he's worse in it. And it's that pressure that opens up those fractures even wider.

1481
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000
And it's interesting that you got this, you saw that with family structures as well.

1482
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
And I could completely see how that happens.

1483
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000
That happens. That happens. Right. That happens. And you don't even need trauma to make that happen.

1484
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I mean, you get the financial trauma on a family. If they're not tight, that'll, that'll make them blow up.

1485
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Yeah. Whereas if they're tight, you know, going through some financial problems, they'll get tighter.

1486
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
They'll buckle down. They'll save money together. They'll skip the movies. They'll start, you know,

1487
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
they'll enjoy cooking raw manoodles together.

1488
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:24.000
So that trauma can, can expose those fractures. That's why it's important to try and

1489
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.000
create the most solid foundation you can with your family and with your own mind.

1490
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
So that when these traumas hit, you don't get fractured.

1491
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Do the seals screen for that.

1492
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.000
They try to, but you'll like this story.

1493
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
So we had to take a psychological screening. This isn't a 90.

1494
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
So it wasn't like we were super advanced on any stuff.

1495
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
And I'm going, and when I was going through bootcamp,

1496
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:55.000
they gave us a psychological screening for, for our attempt to go to to seal training.

1497
01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:00.000
And so they asked a bunch of questions and it was complete the sentence questions.

1498
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
And so it would, it was really obvious what would, what would flag you.

1499
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000
And for, and, and so I made every answer, because we, I was in bootcamp and the food sucked.

1500
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
And so every answer that I gave was just all about food.

1501
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000
So for instance, they, they'd say complete the sentence.

1502
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.000
I hate when my mother, right? So it's pretty easy to think to say,

1503
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.000
you know, I hate when my mother shuns me in front of my sisters and I want to kill her.

1504
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.000
No, no, no, no. All my answers were like, you know, I hate when my mother over cooks this steak

1505
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
and doesn't put enough pepper on it.

1506
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
You know, just like every answer I gave was about food.

1507
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
But it was really easy. My point is that it was really good.

1508
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000
If you were not a complete, even if you were, if you, in fact,

1509
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.000
if you were a psychopath, you would very easily say, answer all the questions correctly and get through it.

1510
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
And there's been plenty of guys that made it through seal training that, you know,

1511
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
there's, there's a bad criminals.

1512
01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:00.000
There's, uh, there's been a couple really heinous crimes committed by guys that were seals.

1513
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000
And just, just, if they made it through, they got screened.

1514
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000
So yeah, they, they had a screening, but I wouldn't say it's the most effective.

1515
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000
They've gotten better now, you know, and some of those guys that committed horrible crimes,

1516
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:18.000
it, you know, kind of inspired the seal teams to step up that screening process as much as possible to make sure that we're not let guys through that are,

1517
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.000
that are deranged some way that are going to do something horrible like that.

1518
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Um, you kind of already talked about these, but is there any other thing that,

1519
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.000
that you learned about yourself in that situation?

1520
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.000
And, and you, I didn't really know too much about the, uh, where you went afterwards at the NIH?

1521
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.000
If you want to go into that a little bit, but what did you learn about yourself through this whole process?

1522
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Obviously you learned something because at some point you decided, you know what, I don't want to, I don't want to do this.

1523
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Yeah, I mean, those are, those are some of the most interesting years of my life.

1524
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.000
And I am pretty glad that I didn't have my first kid till I was 35,

1525
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.000
which on the one hand you sort of think, well, God, I'm so old, you know, like I'm not going to be,

1526
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
I'm not going to be like the 50-year-old grandfather, right?

1527
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Um, but on the other hand, I think it's a really good thing because when I think about what was going on in my mid to late 20s,

1528
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.000
you know, the sort of really difficult decisions I had to make.

1529
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
I mean, leaving medicine after being in it for 10 years was a really difficult decision.

1530
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Especially to go and do something that had nothing to do with medicine.

1531
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000
I mean, when I left, I joined a consulting firm McKinsey in company,

1532
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
and I did credit risk modeling.

1533
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Like I didn't have a think.

1534
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
The fact that I was a doctor was like a liability.

1535
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
There was no, like it was like starting all over again in life.

1536
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Um, so to get to that point, yeah, I had to go through a whole bunch of stuff.

1537
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000
So I think, I mean, I don't even know where to begin.

1538
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
I mean, I think one thing I learned was,

1539
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000
so this fellow that I alluded to earlier Steve Rosenberg, who is,

1540
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000
again, to this day probably one of the most important mentors in my life,

1541
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
outside of family members.

1542
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Um, just an amazing human being, right?

1543
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
So just kind of on another level.

1544
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
And I remember even asking him after being in his lab for two years.

1545
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Because remember, we had a couple of people in the lab who I just didn't think were that good.

1546
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
They really bugged me.

1547
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
They're existence bothered me.

1548
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
And I, and I finally after being in the lab for two years,

1549
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
worked up the courage to ask him like how he,

1550
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
because he's like this guy who's going to win a Nobel Prize.

1551
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Like he's changing the game.

1552
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000
And yet we had a couple people that I kind of thought were bottom feeders.

1553
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
And I was like, you never get upset at them.

1554
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Like ever, I've never seen you get upset at these people.

1555
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
How?

1556
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
And he said, you know, Peter, I just look at everybody

1557
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:57.000
and I figure out at least one thing that they can do well.

1558
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000
And I just figure out a way to empower them to do that one thing,

1559
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000
even if they can't do the ten things that I would expect you to do.

1560
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I remember thinking, I understand in theory what you're saying.

1561
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I can't do that.

1562
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I can't tolerate mediocrity.

1563
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000
So that was a huge thing that I learned.

1564
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:24.000
And it never really hit home again until I was running a non-profit.

1565
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Because there wasn't a lot of mediocrity at Hopkins.

1566
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000
You sort of had your pick of the best residents there.

1567
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Everybody there was the best at what they did.

1568
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
You had amazing nurses, amazing residents,

1569
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
amazing respiratory therapist.

1570
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000
And like everybody there was like the best of their field, right?

1571
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
And then I go to McKinsey same thing.

1572
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
You've kind of got the best of the best all over again.

1573
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
But you know, fast forward five years, I'm now running a non-profit.

1574
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Well, all of a sudden you don't get the best at the best anymore.

1575
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
You're drawing from like the third pool.

1576
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.000
And I remember coming back to that, which is, you know what?

1577
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000
You're probably not cut out to do this.

1578
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000
You have two choices.

1579
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Don't be a leader.

1580
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Just be your own dude.

1581
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Or be a leader.

1582
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
But only with A players.

1583
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.000
But this notion of like you have the capacity to mentor the C players.

1584
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
And maybe turn it into a B plus player.

1585
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Like I don't have those genes.

1586
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I can't do it.

1587
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
And not only that, like I will destroy the C player.

1588
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.000
And I don't mean to, but I will bury them in the ground

1589
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
and become a horrible human to them.

1590
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000
So I also realize like I can be a really bad person.

1591
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:38.000
If I don't, if I don't respect the work that someone's willing to do.

1592
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000
So do you, or do you ever have to find a counter to that?

1593
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Because like if you're in the military and you and I were working together,

1594
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I would be like, hey Peter, you got to get, you got to get, you got to act like,

1595
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
what is it, what is it, whatever.

1596
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
You got to act like him.

1597
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Because in the military, you're not getting a player.

1598
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
So I mean, you got some great guys.

1599
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
You, you know, sealed teams.

1600
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
You got some great guys that are stud.

1601
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
You got some okay guys that are in the middle.

1602
01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
You got some losers down at the bottom.

1603
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Guess what?

1604
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000
You need everything.

1605
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Go on the tongue.

1606
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000
And they all got to give you what you everything may can.

1607
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000
And the more you create conflict with them and the more you are talking

1608
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
down to them, the less they're going to do.

1609
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
You know how they're already a sea level player or a sea level player.

1610
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Yeah, they're going down.

1611
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
You're not, you're not making them any better.

1612
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:21.000
So that's, did you ever try and correct that or you just go through and say, you know what?

1613
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
You've realized that that's like a weakness of yours.

1614
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
I want to be clear.

1615
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.000
There are two attributes that you can be a sea player in and I can cope with one,

1616
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
but I can't cope with the other.

1617
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
And I accept it fully.

1618
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I can cope with someone who has a sea plus intellect.

1619
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000
So if you think about the intellect as the CPU or the computer,

1620
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I don't need everybody to have the fastest CPU.

1621
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:49.000
I accept the fact that like we all have different sort of innate capacities to sort of process

1622
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
and do and you know, we all move at different speeds.

1623
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.000
I can cope with variability there where I cannot cope with variability or maybe I've just chosen

1624
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
I don't want to.

1625
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Is I can't cope with variability on intent, work ethic, integrity.

1626
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Like when you, if you can't be an A player there, I actually don't want you in my life anymore.

1627
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
And I think I'm old enough now that I've just had fuck it.

1628
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
You know, I'm not going to deal with it anymore.

1629
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Life is too short and I'm not going to deal with sea players who fail on those metrics.

1630
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Right?

1631
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
I don't care how smart you are, but if you can't show up and work your ass off,

1632
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:29.000
if you can't be honest, if you can't care, if you can't want to get better,

1633
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
I actually don't want you in my life.

1634
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
So you're right.

1635
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I probably, I mean, I think I'm probably not cut out to be a leader because I can't take

1636
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000
those people who are failing on those metrics and work with them.

1637
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Well, you just need to be a leader of a very high performing team,

1638
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.000
not of a regular regular team.

1639
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Yeah.

1640
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Yeah.

1641
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I never had problems, right?

1642
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:56.000
So when I was a resident, you know, residency is very hierarchical, right?

1643
01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
You know, you've got the med student, the sub by, the intern, the second your resident,

1644
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
the senior resident, the chief resident, the fellow, the attending.

1645
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000
I mean, it's, it's, it's as clear as day who's in charge any moment in time.

1646
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000
And as I'm going up through those ranks, for the most part,

1647
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I never really had difficulty with the teams underneath me, but again,

1648
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
I had the luxury being at Hopkins.

1649
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Everybody there is the best.

1650
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
The best student, they're the best, they're the resident, they're the best.

1651
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
McKinsey, same thing.

1652
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
You know, you're dealing with the best of the best.

1653
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.000
But yeah, running a non-profit, it was like a totally different world to me.

1654
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:33.000
And so I think the difference is a great leader could have succeeded in any environment.

1655
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000
You know, they could have done it.

1656
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.000
They could have figured out like, okay, the reason this person, like, acts like a lazy

1657
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
sack of shit is actually because of this.

1658
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And you can like figure out a way to like, touch them and help them out of that.

1659
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
And I was just like, yeah, I'm not doing it.

1660
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:55.000
So that was, so that's, that's going back to NIH.

1661
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
And you, that was the first time you dealt with people.

1662
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.000
That's the first time I'd sort of seen in a long-term working environment, like a couple

1663
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
people who weren't top agents.

1664
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
And again, maybe part of it's because you're in the government at that point.

1665
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000
And you get some staff people there, maybe who, you know,

1666
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000
and part of it, I think, was just because Steve Rosenberg was such an amazing guy.

1667
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
And he could get the best out of everybody that he might have just had a greater tolerance for that.

1668
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I think the second thing I learned was I would never be a world-class scientist.

1669
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
So when you go to NIH, you're really only going for one reason.

1670
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
I mean, I'm sure there's some people that go there just to check the box and say,

1671
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I was at the NIH.

1672
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
That wasn't why I went.

1673
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I went because Steve Rosenberg was my hero when I was in medical school.

1674
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I read his book called the Transform Cell.

1675
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000
And I was like, that book just, you know, that book along with another book by a guy

1676
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000
and Richard Feynman called Shirley, your joking Mr. Feynman became kind of two of the most important books.

1677
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000
You know, I read during, you know, my 20s.

1678
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000
And actually wouldn't date somebody.

1679
01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
I wouldn't date a girl until she read them.

1680
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000
I'm going to go into after the podcast.

1681
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:09.000
You and I'm going to go to a full on counseling session.

1682
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
You need help.

1683
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:20.000
So I went to NIH because I was like, look, this guy is my god.

1684
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
And like, I want to be like that, right?

1685
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:30.000
I want to be the best surgeon scientist that ever lived.

1686
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.000
And then I got there and I realized that surgery and science couldn't be more different.

1687
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Surgery is the ultimate immediate gratification. Like, surgery, you get to fix the problem in hours.

1688
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Science is a lifetime of work.

1689
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:53.000
A lifetime of failure before success is in fact one of the most remarkable stories from Rosenberg's book,

1690
01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:01.000
which of course I read while in medical school, but it wasn't until a decade later when I'm living it that I really understood why he was great

1691
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:10.000
and why I couldn't be great was when he arrived at NIH in 1974 until he really had his first success was about 10 years.

1692
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:16.000
So for 10 years everything he was trying was failing and every patient died.

1693
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Every single person that showed up died until this one woman in 1984.

1694
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:33.000
When finally they figured out how to do something called interlucantoo and they finally sort of cracked the first piece of what has turned into a very long code.

1695
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:39.000
That 30 years later we're just starting to make really amazing traction on.

1696
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Now think about that for a second.

1697
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:48.000
43 years ago he started that job for 10 straight years he just lost.

1698
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:55.000
It's like you're going to go pay pickup every day for 10 years and lose every day.

1699
01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.000
So what I realized was actually I don't have that intestinal fortitude.

1700
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:07.000
I cannot fail that frequently and still be at my best the next day.

1701
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000
And again I hated knitting that because it sounds awful.

1702
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.000
It sounds like I'm a sock and I guess I suck but I realized like I could be good.

1703
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:24.000
I mean I could go after easier problems to solve where you can like you know get grants and you know just play the game and that's frankly what most people do in this space.

1704
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:37.000
But if you want to like change the game if you want to change mankind if you want to do something seminal you have to be willing to fail forever.

1705
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:46.000
And I realized like I don't I find that ups again it's not that I'm addicted to the win it's not like oh I have to be told good boy good boy good boy but I need some win.

1706
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:52.000
I need to know that I have some control over my fate whereas in surgery you have some control over your fate.

1707
01:27:52.000 --> 01:28:00.000
You know there is a difference between being a good surgeon and being a bad surgeon and it's not to say there's not a good scientist and a great scientist but in science.

1708
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
You are far less in control of what's going on than in surgery.

1709
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Now he must have had some long term vision hypothesis that he absolutely believed it.

1710
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:17.000
He laid it out he said there are four things that have to be true if we're going to ever figure out a way to get the immune system to fight cancer.

1711
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:23.000
These four things have to be true and if they're not true the immune system will never be able to fight cancer.

1712
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.000
And it took ten years just to figure out the first proof of concept in a human.

1713
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:35.000
So yes they had a couple of successes in mice where they had demonstrated okay like at least in mice you can do this.

1714
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:41.000
But in cancer biology you know you don't get terribly excited about doing stuff in mice for very long.

1715
01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:50.000
You know there's a really famous Italian cancer biologist who once famously said if you can't cure cancer in a mouse you need a new profession.

1716
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000
That's that's pretty low hanging fruit you got to be able to do it in people.

1717
01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Oh, at the it was while you were there that you decide you weren't didn't want to go into medicine anymore.

1718
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
So that's complicated right so then I still you're still.

1719
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.000
I was still in the midterm residency so what I so then I went back to Hopkins to finish my surgical training.

1720
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:15.000
But then I decided you know what I think I might actually go into cardiac surgery which I'd always been interested in.

1721
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:19.000
So when I was in medical school I was really torn between cancer surgery and cardiac surgery.

1722
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And you know to go into cancer surgery I think the real focus is going to be on research.

1723
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Like you want to you have to be involved in science and and surgery whereas I thought in cardiac surgery.

1724
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:37.000
You know it's just pretty much the coolest surgery like it's the most technically demanding surgery by far.

1725
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I shouldn't say by far and I think there are other things that are partly on part technically but I was like I also came back in the mindset of you know what I'm just going to.

1726
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:51.000
So become like a great technician right I just and I loved operate I mean the heart is.

1727
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:57.000
And one sense the simplest organ in the body like it's really simple to understand what it's doing you know unlike the brain or the liver where it's just like.

1728
01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Ten layers of complexity like that we kind of know what's going on with the heart and when it comes to operating on it you know it's all a mechanical problem like you know this valve doesn't work oh this pipe doesn't work oh this isn't.

1729
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:17.000
But that was sort of my concession of well you know what you don't have to be the best surgeon scientist why don't you just be the best surgeon.

1730
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Because they are you're more in control right that's that's now just a function of how hard you want to work.

1731
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:31.000
And that was that was that was sort of right at my alley and so then how did that path then drift you don't want to do any of this anymore.

1732
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:39.000
You know I think over the next couple of years I mean just a couple of things changed I mean one was.

1733
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:49.000
You know I wasn't getting frustrated with these patients that we were talking about earlier wasn't the trauma patients that were getting me there was something else that was getting me that was much more frustrating which was the entire system.

1734
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
It seemed like everything we did was.

1735
01:30:53.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Last ditch effort to put incredible resources into a person's life at the very end and we didn't really move the needle that much right so.

1736
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:17.000
It just seemed like a broken system on the other end of the spectrum there's something else that did strike me as broken which actually contrasts or contradicts a little bit of what I said earlier.

1737
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:25.000
I did feel that there was a subtle difference in the quality of residents. Some of the others this guy Chris Sond and day who's like the best resident that ever lived.

1738
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:32.000
You know I think I was a good resident I think the most of the really good residents but there were others that just you know they were good but they weren't great.

1739
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:39.000
And the thing about residency that really bugged me and I think part of this was I was watching my brother who was a lawyer.

1740
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:49.000
So he came out a law school when I came out of medical school like we were the same time and so I start residency when he starts this law practice or he joined like this law firm.

1741
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:59.000
And I remember seeing that it was a totally different world like their promotions seemed more merit based like they went up the ranks.

1742
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:08.000
They got bonuses like all these things happened that were a function of some of my brother was like you know he was like breaking every record at his law firm right like nobody could work as hard.

1743
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Nobody could build as many hours like nobody could like crush it like he could and he was being rewarded for it now he ended up hating it he left he's now a public defender or he's prosecutor rather.

1744
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:30.000
So you know takes a huge pay cut to go and become a prosecutor because that's what he really wanted to do but the point is he could have risen all the way up that chain and I remember thinking in residency I'm like we all get paid the same we all take the same number years to get through.

1745
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:40.000
It seems crazy to me like there's no other system where this would be the case like I couldn't think of another system where you just had this complete total lack of meritocracy.

1746
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:51.000
It was really hard to get fired from residency like I saw some real knuckleheads do some real stupid things I never actually saw anybody get fired which is not say you couldn't sure you could.

1747
01:32:51.000 --> 01:33:19.000
But I felt like I was working a lot harder than was necessary because I just wanted to be better and I thought got it still crazy this is going to take this many years to get through so so that and I also there's just a whole bunch of things about the system structurally that I thought were completely broken and then on the other side I just felt like health care was completely broken as a system right we have this idea yeah.

1748
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:33.000
I don't remember the exact stats but you're going to spend like you know 50 60% of your entire health care dollars and like the last year or two of your life I mean something as an I right and so at the time.

1749
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Life said to me you know you are clearly upset about this system I think you have two choices you should either fix the system or leave it.

1750
01:33:47.000 --> 01:34:02.000
What you're doing now which is staying in the system and not changing it will probably not be sustainable and so I think the toughest decision I ever made was at that point because I'm 30.

1751
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:25.000
I've been 32 33 I've invested 10 years into this and I'm thinking I want to do over I want to complete do over which you know everybody knows that the sunk cost fallacy is called the sunk cost fallacy for a reason but it's still a damn compelling reason to keep doing something.

1752
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:43.000
So that was like it that was a super difficult time and you know in part you sort of feel like you're letting your mentors down because a lot of people had invested a lot in me right Hopkins had taken me right year I was like one of the six chosen ones they only take six categoricals a year so now you're going to leave that program.

1753
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:54.000
And there were you know a couple of attendings I'd become really close to who really believed in me and really said like you're going to you're going to do something really special and then to say actually I'm going to leave.

1754
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000
And I'm not even going to be a doctor anymore I'm just going to go in.

1755
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000
So then you roll straight to McKenzie.

1756
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:12.000
So what I wanted to do is actually go back and get an MBA because I really the other thing I missed a lot in medicine was I missed quantitative.

1757
01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Stuff like I missed math like I missed being an engineer and a few times I tried to bring that into medicine I got spanked right so the you know it's one story I think I've talked about this maybe on a podcast before I don't think so though.

1758
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:46.000
I was like probably my first or second year in the ICU taking care of this patient and this patient's on a very very toxic drug called gentimizing this is a drug that has to be dosed very carefully so if you give too much of it you can destroy their hearing permanently and destroy their kidneys permanently if you don't give enough of it the bacteria that you're trying to kill will kill them.

1759
01:35:46.000 --> 01:36:04.000
So you're you're you have a very narrow range in which to give the dose so there is no standard dose. It's not like oh just take 875 milligrams of this every 12 hours now it's take a first guess based on the patient's body weight so this many milligrams per kilogram give it to them and then measure a level and then.

1760
01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Once the level comes below a certain point give it again.

1761
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:20.000
And I remember thinking that doesn't even make sense like surely we know enough about the kinetics of this drug that we could build a mathematical model to predict when to give it.

1762
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:32.000
So I looked up you know a couple of papers a couple of books one night on call sure enough I find like there's a very predictable alpha and beta decay cycle for this drug.

1763
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Like literally in Excel I build a model that uses a very simple differential equation and it needs a few inputs and it will predict the kinetic curve of this and I'm like alright let's try it out.

1764
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000
So take one of my patients going to be on gentimizing.

1765
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:54.000
I do everything the standard way but I plug my numbers into the model to see would my model have predicted this better and better in the answer was unquestionably.

1766
01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:05.000
So now I start to give a little confident in the idea so like the next night I'm like alright I'm actually going to start dosing the patient based on the model which never puts the patient in jeopardy because you're always going to check the level before you dose.

1767
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:16.000
But you're going to do so at the exact right moment and so my model predicted like at 431 a m this patient will nader which means that's when you need to dose them.

1768
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:25.000
So sure enough at like 4 in the morning I get the pass the nurse to draw the patient's blood to confirm they're just about to nader we're going to redo some in a way we go.

1769
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:34.000
So the next morning on rounds you know in the ICU you round is a big team I'm presenting that you know this patient is one of my patients and I start explaining that.

1770
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Okay so the patient received their dose of gentimizing at 430 in the morning and the attending says well what do you mean 430 morning we never dose gentim at 430 in the morning.

1771
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:48.000
We dose it at 7 a.m always and I'm like yeah yeah but the patient hit their nader at 430.

1772
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:54.000
It's like I don't care you know and so we got into this huge fight and like you know I almost got fired.

1773
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
That would have got me fired by the way.

1774
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Find me someone gets fired.

1775
01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Find me someone gets fired.

1776
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:10.000
And so I mean that pissed me off beyond words right it pissed me off that like it just struck me as so anti intellectual.

1777
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Like maybe my model wasn't perfect I we never know but the fact that nobody even cared to say is there a better way to do this that drove me that shit crazy.

1778
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:29.000
And and that's just one of many stories like that that happened through residency where I was like it's almost like we want to live in the 1950s here.

1779
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:36.000
And so so you have that sort of pain of problem solving is not valued.

1780
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.000
At least it didn't seem valued to me was valued in the lab but I had decided now I'm not going to be in the lab.

1781
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:52.000
So here I live in this world where problem solving is not valued and I don't actually I'm not a quantity more like I don't do math anymore and I really loved math.

1782
01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:03.000
So I started so tutoring kids in math I made like a little bit of free time so I could like tutor high school kids in calculus just like at my calculus on again.

1783
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Missing it but it wasn't the same so so then I was like you know maybe I'll go back and get an MBA so I looked into that didn't feel like I was already drowning in debt at that point in time you know you've got med school debt is sort of painful.

1784
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:24.000
And you know residency you're making I think of the time I'm making about 34,000 bucks a year so it's you're not even putting a dent in your 200,000 dollar debt sort of thing.

1785
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:38.000
So so then I remember one night I was in I was on call and I was really pissed to be on call this night this and I you can relate to this better than I'll ever be able to relate to it because I'm sure this happened to you your whole life but.

1786
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:45.000
My best friend from high school tells me in February he's getting married that August and I'm the best man.

1787
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
He lives in Toronto.

1788
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:55.000
So he's like this is the day to my wife for you. It was like August fifth it's a Saturday. I want you to be the best man completely honored.

1789
01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:00.000
So I tell my program director in February. Can I not be on call.

1790
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.000
That day or the day before.

1791
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:10.000
I just need to I need to be able to fly out of Baltimore in a Friday and come back on a Sunday and he's like hey that's no problem.

1792
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:17.000
I remind him three times no problem no problem sure enough the call schedule comes out I'm on call Saturday.

1793
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
I'm on call the day of the guy's wedding.

1794
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:31.000
He got to be kidding me. So it's two o'clock in that morning. I'm down in the ER looking at a chest CT scan on a guy who I'm worried has it was called a dissecting a order.

1795
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:42.000
And the radiologist. I introduced myself and she's very nice and she walks me through the CT scan and we just start shooting the breeze a little bit.

1796
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:48.000
She says oh yeah you seem kind of down tonight what's up and I was like I am just kind of pissed off. I mean which I wasn't here blah blah blah.

1797
01:40:48.000 --> 01:41:00.000
And she's like yeah I can I can relate I used to be in a surgical residency myself and I was like oh really she goes yeah yeah I did my internship in surgery at the university of Seattle and I just hated it so much that I left and actually joined this company called McKinsey.

1798
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:13.000
You know work there for two years but then decided I wanted to come back to medicine but I wanted to do it in a kind or gentler way so that's why I'm back here doing radiology and I was like oh what's this McKinsey thing? I never heard of it.

1799
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:29.000
And so she told me all about it and I was like huh that sounds interesting how do I apply you know and that was sort of the beginning of it so she introduced me to some folks and you know then I had to like study all over again because the way they interview it these consulting firms is very specific.

1800
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:35.000
You can be the smartest dude in the world if you show up and you haven't thought through how to solve a case.

1801
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Like what are called these case interviews you're gonna flail so you have to actually put in some like work and study so I you know got a bunch of books on case interviews and I'd be sitting in the trauma bay waiting for bodies to come in I'd be like reading my cases you know case interview things before so that that's that was sort of the transition.

1802
01:41:52.000 --> 01:42:04.000
You walk you walk away from medicine you go into so we do in medicine specific consulting so I think it's rooted to do that because McKinsey.

1803
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:10.000
And I'm sure this is true of like Bane and BCG which are kind of the other two really big.

1804
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Management consulting firms. They recruit about a third of their consultants who out of sort of what we call non typical or a typical rather.

1805
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Backgrounds of people who have PhDs or JDs or MDs but who didn't go to business school and then so they send you off to do business school that summer they do this thing called a mini MBA which was.

1806
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:42.000
I mean it was like being a kid in a candy store again because I got to go spend a whole summer in school again learning finance like learning all of these things that you know for some people might seem kind of drive but when you're like just dying to.

1807
01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Get back into numbers.

1808
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:53.000
I was like oh my god like you know I remember the first time we learned what was called the efficient front here which is basically this differential equation that describes you know an investment philosophy.

1809
01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:01.000
I can't believe I'm doing this again. I can't believe it. So so then we show up for orientation.

1810
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000
I'm in San Francisco at this time. That was the other thing. I wanted to get back to California.

1811
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:19.000
So I was like you know San Francisco please. So during the first drink during orientation week I was approached by one of the staffers there and they said hey you know your background looks like you've done a lot of mathematics.

1812
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Yeah they said well you know we know you're a physician and you're probably here to work on you know that all the medical teams are going to try to grab you to have you work on some biotech thing or whatever but we have this banking issue that is very important to some of our clients and it requires you know an ability to do stochastic calculus.

1813
01:43:37.000 --> 01:44:04.000
I was like of course and so then you know that was basically the beginning and I never really stopped doing that stuff. So so I ended up doing what's called credit risk modeling which then which started out around this thing called the Basel 2 Accord which was a type of this was a regulation that came out in the mid 2000s that required banks to hold a certain amount of capital against unexpected losses.

1814
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:12.000
So banks have a long history of knowing how to hold capital for expected losses but they don't really know what to do for unexpected losses.

1815
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:17.000
And in particular the problem that was damning was something called asset value correlations.

1816
01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:28.000
So if you're a bank you could have 27 lines of business. You do first mortgage, second mortgage auto, student credit card like you name it.

1817
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:40.000
And the problem is nobody really understood how those assets correlated. So if your loss rate is x in this what's the probability that it impacts the loss rate in that.

1818
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:47.000
So where that where the rubber meets the road is if I can't make my house payment I'm probably not making my car payment either.

1819
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
That's right.

1820
01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000
That's what nobody got to realize everything went down.

1821
01:44:53.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Oh yeah. So that turned into as we were in the midst of that because the banks used to leverage themselves so much that they could well in when the market crashed they weren't ready for they couldn't handle it.

1822
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:14.000
You know it's such an I mean it's like literally one of my favorite topics actually which I'm sure your listeners don't want to get bored to tears on it.

1823
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:33.000
But the first of all the best movie of all the movies that have like tried to explain what's going on the big short by far does the best job because it actually explains the the sequence of events that went that took this from being just an isolated problem to a systemic problem.

1824
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Most people miss the subtlety of how this thing ceased to be contained. Because technically a housing crisis shouldn't have affected the global economy.

1825
01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:53.000
So it was these instruments called CDOs that effectively allowed this problem to become enormous.

1826
01:45:53.000 --> 01:46:09.000
But at the time the bigger issue was, you know just a great example of hubris that exists everywhere, right, which is one we don't like looking at data that contradict our point of view.

1827
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:22.000
And we're all guilty of this. I'm guilty of this. I find myself doing it and I actually am now quite a muse. I'm so attuned to it now that I'm quite a muse. Like if I'm flipping through Twitter, I'll see a story that is completely against how I feel and I don't want to read it.

1828
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:33.000
And I'm like the next one will be like exactly how I feel, I want to read it. And I'm like, dude, look what you just did man. You've got to stop pull back, go up assume you are wrong and keep going and try to figure out if you're.

1829
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:47.000
But so so at the at the banking level, I mean, and we you know the the canary in the call mine here, well, there were many, but in 2000s early 2006 to 1000 yeah mid 2006.

1830
01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:57.000
We had when we were trying to do these asset value correlations, one of the biggest problems we had is we couldn't we only had 10 years of data.

1831
01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:04.000
The banks only had this data recorded for 10 years. We didn't have losses to model.

1832
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:15.000
And I remember saying to like, you know the controller at this bank, I'm like, hey man, like it's going to be really hard to build you a model of losses when you don't have any historical losses.

1833
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:24.000
And he goes, well, that's mortgage is mortgage is can't lose money. Right. So that was and we can laugh at that now, but at the time that was like not an unreasonable point of view.

1834
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Right. Like you can't lose money on a first mortgage. Think about it. You got to put 20% down. You want to buy home for 100 grand. You better show up with 20. You better be able to document. You have a job. You better do this. You better do that. You better that.

1835
01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:49.000
So you now the banks only on the hook for 80 on a home that's been legitimately appraised for 100 and you've shown documentation. So you're at least going to pay that thing down to 70 such that worst case scenario.

1836
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Market falls by 10% houses worth 90. You lose your job. Guess who still gets paid.

1837
01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:00.000
The bank is still get their 70. Sure, if you're in the business of creating a second mortgage, you take a little bit more risk.

1838
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:09.000
But there's no reason you should have been losing money on first mortgages. And so you fast forward a year.

1839
01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Well, especially because don't worry about the value of the house because that's going to go up.

1840
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
That's right. So we're good to go.

1841
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Oh, well, that's where I remember even when I was in Baltimore, one of my buddies because you know, the residents were always looking for a way to make a buck on the side, right. When you're making 34k.

1842
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:32.000
You got it. You got to come up with the only saving grace as you can't spend money. Like your clothes is free. You're inscrubs all the time.

1843
01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:38.000
You're kind of eating for free all the time because you eat off the patients trays, whatever they didn't finish.

1844
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Like go to the nurses station, eat all this crap. So I didn't actually spend much money.

1845
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:56.000
You just... pens was like the only thing I wasted money on. Like I collect mollongs. And so even through residents here, I would still buy these beautiful pens.

1846
01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:03.000
So yeah, I remember one of my buddies being like dude, we got to start buying houses in Baltimore because like there's so cheap and you can get them with no money down.

1847
01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:08.000
You could buy a house for 200,000 bucks, put like $5,000 down.

1848
01:49:08.12 --> 01:49:13.24
If that house goes up to 220, you just made 25,

1849
01:49:13.24 --> 01:49:14.92
okay, you made 20, okay, on your five.

1850
01:49:14.92 --> 01:49:16.36
We're going all the way.

1851
01:49:16.36 --> 01:49:20.68
And no one does the math of what if it goes down to 190?

1852
01:49:20.68 --> 01:49:23.88
You just lost everything, right?

1853
01:49:23.88 --> 01:49:28.88
So luckily, I didn't get in any of those sweetheart deals.

1854
01:49:28.88 --> 01:49:30.56
Although, you know, if you'd time them right,

1855
01:49:30.56 --> 01:49:31.84
there were a lot of people did make a lot of money

1856
01:49:31.84 --> 01:49:33.52
and those deals before the shoe fell.

1857
01:49:33.52 --> 01:49:37.32
So when things started to become clear,

1858
01:49:37.32 --> 01:49:42.32
so in early, in early O7, it became clear,

1859
01:49:43.92 --> 01:49:47.64
subprime mortgages were going to be a problem.

1860
01:49:47.64 --> 01:49:52.40
By August of O7, a very famous,

1861
01:49:52.40 --> 01:49:54.72
then famous analyst,

1862
01:49:54.72 --> 01:49:59.000
it's her name, Meredith, Whitney, I believe,

1863
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:03.68
is her name, I think she's an opera called something

1864
01:50:03.68 --> 01:50:05.92
that the time seemed crazy.

1865
01:50:05.92 --> 01:50:09.20
She said, city group is going to cut its dividend next month.

1866
01:50:09.20 --> 01:50:10.60
So for city group, you know,

1867
01:50:10.60 --> 01:50:12.60
one of the largest banks in the country

1868
01:50:12.60 --> 01:50:16.08
to not pay a dividend for Q3 seemed impossible.

1869
01:50:16.08 --> 01:50:17.84
But she'd done the math, she's like, yeah, there's no way.

1870
01:50:17.84 --> 01:50:21.32
They're getting crushed on these mortgage back securities.

1871
01:50:21.32 --> 01:50:22.92
And everyone was like, she doesn't know,

1872
01:50:22.92 --> 01:50:25.64
she's talking about, sure enough, Q3 comes along,

1873
01:50:25.64 --> 01:50:28.44
city cuts its dividend, Chuck prints the CEO

1874
01:50:28.44 --> 01:50:30.16
of city gets fired.

1875
01:50:30.16 --> 01:50:32.16
And at that point, it's like, God damn.

1876
01:50:32.16 --> 01:50:36.000
But again, everybody was still thinking,

1877
01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.80
this is just a subprime problem.

1878
01:50:37.80 --> 01:50:40.88
It's an inch wide and yet some mild deep, but it's an inch wide.

1879
01:50:40.88 --> 01:50:43.96
Well, in a background, we're working on another problem,

1880
01:50:43.96 --> 01:50:45.76
which is prime mortgages.

1881
01:50:45.76 --> 01:50:48.60
That which everybody thinks is totally fine.

1882
01:50:48.60 --> 01:50:50.52
That which has a historical default ratio

1883
01:50:50.52 --> 01:50:52.68
of less than half a percent.

1884
01:50:52.68 --> 01:50:55.48
And we're seeing in the data,

1885
01:50:55.48 --> 01:50:58.52
the data that was right in front of this bank the whole time,

1886
01:50:58.52 --> 01:51:02.40
oh, there's a tsunami coming.

1887
01:51:02.40 --> 01:51:05.44
Your default rate's going to hit four, five percent,

1888
01:51:05.44 --> 01:51:07.36
which again, that might not sound like a lot.

1889
01:51:07.36 --> 01:51:09.64
That's 10 times your default rate.

1890
01:51:09.64 --> 01:51:11.92
It's going to be actually higher than that as we learned.

1891
01:51:11.92 --> 01:51:15.32
And your loss given a default is going up much higher.

1892
01:51:15.32 --> 01:51:18.68
So loss is actually the dot product

1893
01:51:18.68 --> 01:51:22.08
of probability of default and loss given default.

1894
01:51:22.08 --> 01:51:24.28
Okay, you guys are my only two customers.

1895
01:51:24.28 --> 01:51:28.68
Probability you default is 50% probability you defaults 10%.

1896
01:51:28.68 --> 01:51:31.88
If you default, you will lose 100,000.

1897
01:51:31.88 --> 01:51:33.88
So it's 10% times 100,000.

1898
01:51:33.88 --> 01:51:36.04
I expect to lose 10,000 on you.

1899
01:51:36.04 --> 01:51:38.16
If you default, it's 2000.

1900
01:51:38.16 --> 01:51:40.76
So 50% times 2000.

1901
01:51:40.76 --> 01:51:43.64
So my total expected loss is 11,000.

1902
01:51:43.64 --> 01:51:46.96
So this is, you know, you do this 88 million times

1903
01:51:46.96 --> 01:51:48.60
for every account you have.

1904
01:51:48.60 --> 01:51:50.36
And the model to predict probability

1905
01:51:50.36 --> 01:51:52.68
to fault and loss given to fault are enormous models

1906
01:51:52.68 --> 01:51:54.48
that each have 50 variables in them.

1907
01:51:54.48 --> 01:51:57.000
Actually, the PD does the LGD doesn't.

1908
01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
But what people didn't realize is the loss given

1909
01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.84
to faults were skyrocketing.

1910
01:52:00.84 --> 01:52:04.40
It was like, in fact, again, at the level of just

1911
01:52:04.40 --> 01:52:05.72
being kind of a math idiot.

1912
01:52:05.72 --> 01:52:10.32
Like that to me was so amazing to watch.

1913
01:52:10.32 --> 01:52:12.40
It was like, holy shit.

1914
01:52:12.40 --> 01:52:14.48
Watch these LGDs go.

1915
01:52:14.48 --> 01:52:15.92
They're just like blowing up.

1916
01:52:15.92 --> 01:52:19.60
And then you knew once the PD triggered,

1917
01:52:19.60 --> 01:52:21.92
meaning once the probability of default went,

1918
01:52:21.92 --> 01:52:27.36
oh, it was going to become a non-linear catastrophe.

1919
01:52:27.36 --> 01:52:30.48
And it turned out so November 15,

1920
01:52:30.48 --> 01:52:32.84
Thursday, November 15, 2007,

1921
01:52:32.84 --> 01:52:35.40
was kind of the day like that was the matrix moment.

1922
01:52:35.40 --> 01:52:37.12
So I had a team, great example.

1923
01:52:37.12 --> 01:52:38.84
I was able to be a leader for once,

1924
01:52:38.84 --> 01:52:40.64
because I had an amazing team.

1925
01:52:40.64 --> 01:52:43.52
I had a team in San Francisco of four people.

1926
01:52:43.52 --> 01:52:46.32
I had a team in India of four guys.

1927
01:52:46.32 --> 01:52:49.96
We worked around the clock 16 hours a day, every day,

1928
01:52:49.96 --> 01:52:52.92
except Sundays we took off, and we would pass the model

1929
01:52:52.92 --> 01:52:54.40
back and forth through each other.

1930
01:52:54.40 --> 01:52:54.96
Amazing.

1931
01:52:54.96 --> 01:52:59.32
It was pure bliss to be working that hard on this problem.

1932
01:52:59.32 --> 01:53:02.68
And on that day, we basically came up with four independent

1933
01:53:02.68 --> 01:53:06.92
models that all predicted how bad this thing was going to be.

1934
01:53:06.92 --> 01:53:11.28
And we presented it to the leadership of this bank.

1935
01:53:11.28 --> 01:53:13.24
And it's really funny.

1936
01:53:13.24 --> 01:53:14.92
I was a manager.

1937
01:53:14.92 --> 01:53:18.56
So it McKinsey, you have these levels like Analyst Associate

1938
01:53:18.56 --> 01:53:21.20
Manager, Junior Partner, Partner Director.

1939
01:53:21.20 --> 01:53:24.40
For a meeting of that stature, meaning you're talking

1940
01:53:24.40 --> 01:53:25.76
to the entire leadership of the bank,

1941
01:53:25.76 --> 01:53:28.56
the senior partner would only be the one to predict.

1942
01:53:28.56 --> 01:53:30.96
I'd be in the corner, work in the PowerPoint,

1943
01:53:30.96 --> 01:53:33.44
answering a question if piped up,

1944
01:53:33.44 --> 01:53:35.08
because there's going to be a technical question.

1945
01:53:35.08 --> 01:53:37.84
But the senior partner would do all the talking.

1946
01:53:37.84 --> 01:53:39.40
But on that day, we go into the meeting

1947
01:53:39.40 --> 01:53:42.44
and the senior partner says, Peter, you should present this.

1948
01:53:42.44 --> 01:53:43.80
And I said, are you short?

1949
01:53:43.80 --> 01:53:46.44
Because I'm like the third most junior guy in the room here.

1950
01:53:46.44 --> 01:53:49.44
And he said, yeah, two reasons, one, you're the only one

1951
01:53:49.44 --> 01:53:51.88
who actually understands how all of these models work.

1952
01:53:51.88 --> 01:53:53.28
And this is the funniest thing he said.

1953
01:53:53.28 --> 01:53:56.44
He goes to, because of all of your experience

1954
01:53:56.44 --> 01:54:00.12
with cancer patients, you're going to be very good

1955
01:54:00.12 --> 01:54:04.88
at answering hard questions about bad things happening.

1956
01:54:04.88 --> 01:54:06.20
And I was like, OK.

1957
01:54:06.20 --> 01:54:11.40
So I stepped in and I did my best to be empathetic and non-judgmental

1958
01:54:11.40 --> 01:54:14.48
and just as evidence, fact-based as I could.

1959
01:54:14.48 --> 01:54:15.48
And this is what this says.

1960
01:54:15.48 --> 01:54:17.52
And this is what you look at the run-right model

1961
01:54:17.52 --> 01:54:20.20
and the PGD says this and the LGD says this.

1962
01:54:20.20 --> 01:54:22.24
And the vintage model says this.

1963
01:54:22.24 --> 01:54:26.40
And so finally, like the president of the bank says,

1964
01:54:26.40 --> 01:54:29.48
how much money are we going to lose?

1965
01:54:29.48 --> 01:54:31.68
Like she was kind of like, you know, like all good leaders.

1966
01:54:31.68 --> 01:54:35.28
She's just like, just get to tell me the goddamn answer first.

1967
01:54:35.28 --> 01:54:38.04
So I said, I had to think on my feet

1968
01:54:38.04 --> 01:54:40.44
like pretty quickly about a way to put it in terms.

1969
01:54:40.44 --> 01:54:44.32
So I said, you're going to lose more money

1970
01:54:44.32 --> 01:54:50.76
in the next 18 months than you've made in the last 10 years.

1971
01:54:50.76 --> 01:54:53.28
And see the Jaco answer to that question?

1972
01:54:53.28 --> 01:54:55.20
How much money were we going to lose?

1973
01:54:55.20 --> 01:54:56.56
Would have been all of it.

1974
01:55:00.96 --> 01:55:03.16
That's the difference between you and me on Twitter.

1975
01:55:03.16 --> 01:55:06.64
Like you always have the best answer.

1976
01:55:06.64 --> 01:55:07.28
Like always.

1977
01:55:07.28 --> 01:55:09.32
Because that would be like, hey, Jaco,

1978
01:55:09.32 --> 01:55:10.44
like you just picture that on Twitter.

1979
01:55:10.44 --> 01:55:12.48
Like, you know, see you of like the bank.

1980
01:55:12.48 --> 01:55:14.28
Hey, Jaco, how much money were you going to do?

1981
01:55:14.28 --> 01:55:15.76
All of it.

1982
01:55:15.76 --> 01:55:18.04
Peter, one of three.

1983
01:55:18.04 --> 01:55:21.04
Well, start with your event last year.

1984
01:55:21.04 --> 01:55:22.92
Multiply that by two of them.

1985
01:55:22.92 --> 01:55:25.20
Three of three.

1986
01:55:25.20 --> 01:55:26.20
Three of three.

1987
01:55:26.20 --> 01:55:27.20
Yeah.

1988
01:55:27.20 --> 01:55:29.56
Did they listen to you at all?

1989
01:55:29.56 --> 01:55:30.56
Yeah.

1990
01:55:30.56 --> 01:55:31.68
They want to leave that data.

1991
01:55:31.68 --> 01:55:32.68
They did that was impossible.

1992
01:55:32.68 --> 01:55:35.44
That was impossible to fathom years later.

1993
01:55:35.44 --> 01:55:37.36
Because I had it by this point left McKinsey.

1994
01:55:37.36 --> 01:55:40.16
But I stayed in close touch with that team.

1995
01:55:40.16 --> 01:55:43.000
And I reached back out to that senior partner

1996
01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.16
who actually ran still very close with he had just got

1997
01:55:45.16 --> 01:55:47.40
a meal from him two days ago.

1998
01:55:47.40 --> 01:55:49.92
I said, hey, man, remember all those models?

1999
01:55:49.92 --> 01:55:51.12
Yeah, yeah.

2000
01:55:51.12 --> 01:55:53.80
Did we, were we roughly close?

2001
01:55:53.80 --> 01:55:58.96
And he goes, oh, no, the models underestimated by a third.

2002
01:55:58.96 --> 01:56:01.12
I mean, it was like, it seemed like we kept trying

2003
01:56:01.12 --> 01:56:02.32
to tone the models down.

2004
01:56:02.32 --> 01:56:03.64
Because they kept giving us these answers.

2005
01:56:03.64 --> 01:56:08.56
And we were like, damn, like there's no way it can be this bad.

2006
01:56:08.56 --> 01:56:10.24
And we were like, oh, let's make this assumption

2007
01:56:10.24 --> 01:56:11.04
more conservative.

2008
01:56:11.04 --> 01:56:12.04
And let's do this.

2009
01:56:12.04 --> 01:56:15.12
You know, in the end, it was like, no, it was actually that bad.

2010
01:56:15.12 --> 01:56:16.12
Brutal.

2011
01:56:16.12 --> 01:56:19.60
So then now I remember, I saw you tell a story one time.

2012
01:56:19.60 --> 01:56:21.40
It's on YouTube somewhere.

2013
01:56:21.40 --> 01:56:24.88
But you're talking about a patient you were working on.

2014
01:56:24.88 --> 01:56:27.12
You kind of alluded to this earlier.

2015
01:56:27.12 --> 01:56:30.72
Either pre-diabetic or diabetic and you're sitting there

2016
01:56:30.72 --> 01:56:32.60
going, you got to be kidding me.

2017
01:56:32.60 --> 01:56:34.68
Because the day before you tried to save someone's life,

2018
01:56:34.68 --> 01:56:36.72
that was a young kid.

2019
01:56:36.72 --> 01:56:39.24
And that was sort of the first time that you started thinking

2020
01:56:39.24 --> 01:56:45.000
about nutrition as an earlier, you talked about, hey,

2021
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.32
we do all this stuff at the end of life.

2022
01:56:46.32 --> 01:56:49.56
It's all this prevention to prevent someone from actually dying.

2023
01:56:49.56 --> 01:56:52.20
But if we would have invested some of that money up front,

2024
01:56:52.20 --> 01:56:55.64
taught these people out of eat, we would have been better off.

2025
01:56:55.64 --> 01:56:58.04
Is that sort of where it came from or not at all?

2026
01:56:58.04 --> 01:57:00.84
I mean, I never made that connection at back time.

2027
01:57:00.84 --> 01:57:03.12
So at that time, it was just what you describe.

2028
01:57:03.12 --> 01:57:07.84
It was just the visceral reaction of, I'm so angry at you.

2029
01:57:07.84 --> 01:57:10.80
How can you not take care of yourself?

2030
01:57:10.80 --> 01:57:15.20
How can you be sitting here so fat, so diabetic?

2031
01:57:15.20 --> 01:57:19.84
Over and over again, you come in here to have these ulcers

2032
01:57:19.84 --> 01:57:22.92
debreed and to have these things amputated.

2033
01:57:22.92 --> 01:57:24.68
And you know how the story is going to go.

2034
01:57:24.68 --> 01:57:25.68
Just get it together.

2035
01:57:25.68 --> 01:57:29.48
So this was, I didn't say those words, but that's how I'm feeling.

2036
01:57:29.48 --> 01:57:35.96
And so that's just part of the callousness

2037
01:57:35.96 --> 01:57:38.84
that developed towards that subset of patient.

2038
01:57:38.84 --> 01:57:47.36
It wasn't until probably 2009, so I'm out of medicine now.

2039
01:57:47.36 --> 01:57:49.16
But I was becoming overweight.

2040
01:57:49.16 --> 01:57:50.84
And I was pre-diabetic.

2041
01:57:50.84 --> 01:57:51.48
I wasn't diabetic.

2042
01:57:51.48 --> 01:57:53.16
I was pre-diabetic.

2043
01:57:53.16 --> 01:57:56.44
And I was, you know, that I was sort of a comphal circle.

2044
01:57:56.44 --> 01:57:57.60
That I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2045
01:57:57.60 --> 01:57:58.72
I do everything right.

2046
01:57:58.72 --> 01:58:01.40
I mean, I'm swimming four hours a day.

2047
01:58:01.40 --> 01:58:04.84
I'm following that goddamn food pyramid to the core.

2048
01:58:04.84 --> 01:58:06.80
I don't need saturated fat.

2049
01:58:06.80 --> 01:58:10.60
I'm like, you know, I, I carb load like a band sheet.

2050
01:58:10.60 --> 01:58:14.40
Like, why am I, why is all this stuff happening to me?

2051
01:58:14.40 --> 01:58:18.44
And so then when I, you know, went through my whole discovery

2052
01:58:18.44 --> 01:58:21.92
process of figuring that out, it was only then that I really

2053
01:58:21.92 --> 01:58:27.32
thought back and reflected upon, you know, the horrible way I had

2054
01:58:27.32 --> 01:58:30.20
treated, not just that patient, particularly, but obviously

2055
01:58:30.20 --> 01:58:32.40
many other patients like her.

2056
01:58:32.40 --> 01:58:34.80
I remember her case specifically, because it was probably

2057
01:58:34.80 --> 01:58:39.60
like the absolute low point of my existence.

2058
01:58:39.60 --> 01:58:45.36
So it, unfortunately, it took me sort of failing on my own,

2059
01:58:45.36 --> 01:58:48.32
because at least then I could say this isn't a well-power problem.

2060
01:58:48.32 --> 01:58:49.72
It's not like you don't care.

2061
01:58:49.72 --> 01:58:52.000
It's not like you're not trying.

2062
01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.16
You're doing what you're told to do and you're failing miserably.

2063
01:58:55.16 --> 01:59:00.44
So either you're an outlier or maybe the advice is incorrect.

2064
01:59:00.44 --> 01:59:02.60
So you're eating what you're being told to eat.

2065
01:59:02.60 --> 01:59:06.68
You're car bloating and you're still getting fat.

2066
01:59:06.68 --> 01:59:06.68
Yeah.

2067
01:59:06.68 --> 01:59:08.60
Even though, in, at this time, you're swimming.

2068
01:59:08.60 --> 01:59:10.24
We were just talking about it before the podcast.

2069
01:59:10.24 --> 01:59:14.44
You're doing ultra long swims, dozens of miles worth of

2070
01:59:14.44 --> 01:59:17.68
swimming, which, by the way, in seal training, in basic

2071
01:59:17.68 --> 01:59:20.28
seal training, the longest you swim is five and a half

2072
01:59:20.28 --> 01:59:24.52
nautical miles, which is six point two statute miles, which,

2073
01:59:24.52 --> 01:59:26.36
and that's with swim fins on.

2074
01:59:26.36 --> 01:59:28.52
So you're out there in the, and you're out there in the open

2075
01:59:28.52 --> 01:59:33.08
ocean swimming, 12, 15, 18 miles at a time.

2076
01:59:33.08 --> 01:59:36.28
And you're training for that, working hard, and you're

2077
01:59:36.28 --> 01:59:40.92
quote-unquote eating right because you're not eating saturated fat.

2078
01:59:40.92 --> 01:59:43.56
And yet you're getting fat, you go into the doctor,

2079
01:59:43.56 --> 01:59:45.80
you get blooddred test, and they say, oh, yeah, by the way,

2080
01:59:45.80 --> 01:59:47.48
you're pre-diabetic.

2081
01:59:47.48 --> 01:59:49.96
And you just say to yourself, what is going on?

2082
01:59:49.96 --> 01:59:53.08
Yeah, and truth be told, I was actually more pissed just

2083
01:59:53.08 --> 01:59:55.88
from the vanity standpoint at being fat.

2084
01:59:55.88 --> 01:59:58.20
I mean, I wish I could say that.

2085
01:59:58.20 --> 01:59:59.64
If you're not, if you're losing it on the podcast,

2086
01:59:59.64 --> 02:00:02.44
echo is not, if you're too enthusiastic, we did that.

2087
02:00:02.44 --> 02:00:06.04
I mean, I wish I could say, oh, it didn't bother me to be fat.

2088
02:00:06.04 --> 02:00:07.16
It did bother me to be fat.

2089
02:00:07.16 --> 02:00:09.48
It really bothered me to be fat, right?

2090
02:00:09.48 --> 02:00:12.68
It bothered me.

2091
02:00:12.68 --> 02:00:14.12
It bothered me a lot, actually.

2092
02:00:14.12 --> 02:00:17.000
And so much so that I actually wanted to get a gastric bypass.

2093
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:22.76
And so I went, so right now I'm about 175.

2094
02:00:22.76 --> 02:00:25.96
I was probably 205 to 210.

2095
02:00:25.96 --> 02:00:28.36
So once again, after this podcast, you and I,

2096
02:00:28.36 --> 02:00:29.88
we're going to the counseling session.

2097
02:00:29.88 --> 02:00:33.08
No, no, no, no.

2098
02:00:33.08 --> 02:00:36.92
So I went to, I finally got my doctor to get me a referral

2099
02:00:36.92 --> 02:00:41.000
to this guy named Ken Fujioka, who's like a very prominent

2100
02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.48
bariatric physician here in San Diego.

2101
02:00:43.48 --> 02:00:45.08
So I finally go to see Fujioka.

2102
02:00:45.08 --> 02:00:47.08
So I'm sitting in the waiting room.

2103
02:00:47.08 --> 02:00:51.24
And I actually, I think I told this story on Tim's podcast.

2104
02:00:51.24 --> 02:00:52.36
I don't remember telling you.

2105
02:00:52.36 --> 02:00:52.92
I did tell it.

2106
02:00:52.92 --> 02:00:55.08
But it is in the book.

2107
02:00:55.08 --> 02:00:57.08
It's in the history of the time.

2108
02:00:57.08 --> 02:00:58.44
It's the story of the time.

2109
02:00:58.44 --> 02:01:01.80
So I put in the spirit of assuming nobody listens to

2110
02:01:01.80 --> 02:01:03.16
or reads multiple of the thing.

2111
02:01:03.16 --> 02:01:05.000
So I'm in the waiting room.

2112
02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:06.36
I'm finally waiting to see.

2113
02:01:06.36 --> 02:01:07.88
And the nurse comes out.

2114
02:01:07.88 --> 02:01:10.44
And before you go back to the clinic room,

2115
02:01:10.44 --> 02:01:11.32
like you have to get weight.

2116
02:01:11.32 --> 02:01:13.16
That's just part of the protocol, right?

2117
02:01:13.16 --> 02:01:15.64
So like they call my name.

2118
02:01:15.64 --> 02:01:17.88
So I walk up and I get on the scale.

2119
02:01:17.88 --> 02:01:20.04
And the nurse comes out and weighs me.

2120
02:01:20.04 --> 02:01:21.80
And it's like, you know, whatever, 210.

2121
02:01:21.80 --> 02:01:25.24
And she's like, congratulations.

2122
02:01:25.24 --> 02:01:26.68
I'm like, what?

2123
02:01:26.68 --> 02:01:29.40
She goes, you're post-surgery, right?

2124
02:01:29.40 --> 02:01:33.72
And I'm like, no, I'm here to be evaluated for surgery.

2125
02:01:33.72 --> 02:01:34.92
She looks at me.

2126
02:01:34.92 --> 02:01:38.12
Looks out at the waiting room where everybody's 400 pounds.

2127
02:01:38.12 --> 02:01:40.60
And like, doesn't say a word.

2128
02:01:40.60 --> 02:01:43.96
But the look in her eyes is basically like,

2129
02:01:43.96 --> 02:01:45.80
what the hell is wrong with you?

2130
02:01:45.80 --> 02:01:47.16
Yeah, you got serious issues.

2131
02:01:47.16 --> 02:01:54.20
So I'm like, it's like a reasonable idea.

2132
02:01:54.20 --> 02:01:56.52
Well, yeah, a very reasonable, very reasonable.

2133
02:01:56.52 --> 02:01:59.52
You might want to check your reasonable ideas with me.

2134
02:01:59.52 --> 02:02:01.32
Future.

2135
02:02:01.32 --> 02:02:03.40
Because that is not a reasonable idea.

2136
02:02:03.40 --> 02:02:06.52
So you don't do that surgery, obviously.

2137
02:02:06.52 --> 02:02:07.52
But what?

2138
02:02:07.52 --> 02:02:08.72
He, that guy had no patience for me.

2139
02:02:08.72 --> 02:02:09.76
What clicked on your brain?

2140
02:02:09.76 --> 02:02:11.12
Did you just, all the sudden, say to yourself,

2141
02:02:11.12 --> 02:02:12.000
okay, how is this happening?

2142
02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.76
And then you remembered your A and P class,

2143
02:02:14.76 --> 02:02:17.12
and said this was just what's happening?

2144
02:02:17.12 --> 02:02:19.44
I remember, clear as day.

2145
02:02:19.44 --> 02:02:24.44
So September 7th, 2009, I did,

2146
02:02:26.72 --> 02:02:29.04
I sort of did like one of these long swims a year.

2147
02:02:29.04 --> 02:02:30.64
You know, you do a bunch of short ones of bunch of training.

2148
02:02:30.64 --> 02:02:32.24
But Joey's, I got how to one main event.

2149
02:02:32.24 --> 02:02:34.28
From a main event this year was,

2150
02:02:34.28 --> 02:02:35.84
I went back to Catalina Island,

2151
02:02:35.84 --> 02:02:39.44
and I wanted to swim from now LA out to Catalina.

2152
02:02:39.44 --> 02:02:42.88
I had previously gone from Catalina to LA.

2153
02:02:42.88 --> 02:02:46.40
And it was tough swim.

2154
02:02:46.40 --> 02:02:48.000
I had a torn labrum.

2155
02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.40
So about six hours in, you know,

2156
02:02:50.40 --> 02:02:52.80
it just became unbearable pain.

2157
02:02:53.80 --> 02:02:58.12
And you don't usually have a head current

2158
02:02:58.12 --> 02:02:59.20
in the Catalina channel.

2159
02:02:59.20 --> 02:03:00.28
So the sand paid for a channel,

2160
02:03:00.28 --> 02:03:01.88
you know this is going to be trained out there.

2161
02:03:01.88 --> 02:03:04.64
The currents usually running from point conception down

2162
02:03:04.64 --> 02:03:05.48
or up.

2163
02:03:05.48 --> 02:03:07.28
So you usually have a little bit of a cross current,

2164
02:03:07.28 --> 02:03:10.36
very rare to get anything back or forth.

2165
02:03:10.36 --> 02:03:14.56
And if anything, it's generally a little bit towards the island.

2166
02:03:14.56 --> 02:03:19.56
And when I had swam four years earlier from Catalina to LA,

2167
02:03:20.08 --> 02:03:21.76
it took 10 and a half hours.

2168
02:03:21.76 --> 02:03:25.20
But that was only 18 months after I learned how to swim.

2169
02:03:25.20 --> 02:03:28.16
That was a much better swimmer in 2009.

2170
02:03:28.16 --> 02:03:31.16
And I was going in the theoretically faster direction.

2171
02:03:31.16 --> 02:03:35.44
So a great example is expectations can kill you.

2172
02:03:35.44 --> 02:03:39.40
So I'm expecting this to be like a nine hour swim back.

2173
02:03:39.40 --> 02:03:41.28
And really the only thing I'm thinking about,

2174
02:03:41.28 --> 02:03:43.36
which is the worst thing you think about in marathon swimming,

2175
02:03:43.36 --> 02:03:46.80
you should never ever think about how long this is going to take.

2176
02:03:46.80 --> 02:03:48.84
Because you're just setting yourself up for misery.

2177
02:03:48.84 --> 02:03:51.52
The only real question I had is could I break nine hours.

2178
02:03:51.52 --> 02:03:53.76
I should be able to break nine hours, right?

2179
02:03:53.76 --> 02:03:57.12
So to make a long story short, I don't even come close.

2180
02:03:57.12 --> 02:03:59.96
This is a total disaster scenario.

2181
02:03:59.96 --> 02:04:01.92
The other thing you want to appreciate this,

2182
02:04:01.92 --> 02:04:04.76
just to appreciate this stupidity.

2183
02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.68
You never want to look anywhere when you're swimming,

2184
02:04:08.68 --> 02:04:09.52
except down.

2185
02:04:09.52 --> 02:04:13.92
It's very demoralizing when you're in the middle.

2186
02:04:13.92 --> 02:04:15.32
Like if you're in the middle of the channel,

2187
02:04:15.32 --> 02:04:18.04
you don't see land from the water level.

2188
02:04:18.04 --> 02:04:19.04
You just don't.

2189
02:04:19.04 --> 02:04:19.56
So that's the.

2190
02:04:19.56 --> 02:04:21.60
So before you get in the water,

2191
02:04:21.60 --> 02:04:25.72
you tell the crew and every I've crew chief for a lot of great swimmerism.

2192
02:04:25.72 --> 02:04:28.52
I mean, it's the crew asks the swimmer,

2193
02:04:28.52 --> 02:04:31.84
what do you want, what information do you want?

2194
02:04:31.84 --> 02:04:34.60
So we're starting the swim in midnight at Point Facente.

2195
02:04:34.60 --> 02:04:39.48
I said, okay, I want to know when there are exactly 10 miles.

2196
02:04:39.48 --> 02:04:42.32
To go and exactly four miles to go.

2197
02:04:42.32 --> 02:04:44.12
What's the total distance of the swim?

2198
02:04:44.12 --> 02:04:46.36
Well, as a crow flies, it's 21.

2199
02:04:46.36 --> 02:04:49.36
And if so, if you don't have a current,

2200
02:04:49.36 --> 02:04:50.76
you're doing a 21 miles swim.

2201
02:04:50.76 --> 02:04:52.76
If you do have a current, you're going to swim more than that.

2202
02:04:52.76 --> 02:04:54.60
So, so that's what I said,

2203
02:04:54.60 --> 02:04:57.60
as a guys, I want to know when there's 10 to go and forward to go.

2204
02:04:57.60 --> 02:04:58.12
Why?

2205
02:04:58.12 --> 02:04:58.80
10 to go.

2206
02:04:58.80 --> 02:05:00.28
You're just a little over half way.

2207
02:05:00.28 --> 02:05:01.60
I'd like to just know that.

2208
02:05:01.60 --> 02:05:04.84
At four to go, it's put your head down and swim for two hours.

2209
02:05:04.84 --> 02:05:05.68
Don't do anything.

2210
02:05:05.68 --> 02:05:06.32
You're there.

2211
02:05:06.32 --> 02:05:09.16
So, start the swim in midnight.

2212
02:05:09.16 --> 02:05:10.44
This is in September.

2213
02:05:10.44 --> 02:05:13.96
So, I forget what time the sun was rising back then.

2214
02:05:13.96 --> 02:05:18.64
But I knew that I would have 10 to go before the sun came up.

2215
02:05:18.64 --> 02:05:21.44
So, in other words, I knew that once the light was up,

2216
02:05:21.44 --> 02:05:23.84
I was going to be inside the 10 stretch.

2217
02:05:23.84 --> 02:05:27.96
And one of the most amazing things about swimming in the middle of the ocean.

2218
02:05:27.96 --> 02:05:30.48
I don't know if you got to experience this during training is

2219
02:05:30.48 --> 02:05:35.28
in the Pacific, the bio-luminous is so strong.

2220
02:05:35.28 --> 02:05:38.16
And so, on a clear night, which I was always lucky to have,

2221
02:05:38.16 --> 02:05:40.64
every time I swim out, I've done a lot of the channel swims.

2222
02:05:40.64 --> 02:05:43.92
Every time I've been out there, I've always been blessed with these clear nights.

2223
02:05:43.92 --> 02:05:48.56
It's so dark, because once you get out of LA's light,

2224
02:05:48.56 --> 02:05:50.84
under the water, so your hand is coming down.

2225
02:05:50.84 --> 02:05:54.44
You are seeing the bio-luminoussins flare off your hands.

2226
02:05:54.44 --> 02:05:56.80
When you breathe, you are seeing the stars.

2227
02:05:56.80 --> 02:05:58.60
You can't tell the difference.

2228
02:05:58.60 --> 02:05:59.88
It is so dark.

2229
02:05:59.88 --> 02:06:02.88
You cannot see the difference between stars and bio-luminoussins.

2230
02:06:02.88 --> 02:06:04.72
It's like being in this amazing chamber.

2231
02:06:04.72 --> 02:06:08.92
And so, that's the reward you get for swimming at night,

2232
02:06:08.92 --> 02:06:11.48
which is otherwise incredibly lonely.

2233
02:06:11.48 --> 02:06:14.08
And then the first thing you notice is the bio-luminous

2234
02:06:14.08 --> 02:06:16.24
gets harder and harder to see, which means, oh,

2235
02:06:16.24 --> 02:06:18.48
the sun's going to be up in an hour.

2236
02:06:18.48 --> 02:06:20.44
The sun comes up.

2237
02:06:20.44 --> 02:06:22.04
Now the sun's like up there.

2238
02:06:22.04 --> 02:06:25.36
I haven't heard anything, and I'm like, those guys,

2239
02:06:25.36 --> 02:06:27.76
they forgot to tell me I've got 10 to go.

2240
02:06:27.76 --> 02:06:28.96
That's OK.

2241
02:06:28.96 --> 02:06:31.48
Probably down to 6 to go now.

2242
02:06:31.48 --> 02:06:32.64
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming.

2243
02:06:32.64 --> 02:06:34.000
I'm just feeling like 10 o'clock in the morning.

2244
02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.000
I mean, I'm being fissacious.

2245
02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.12
It's probably like 830 in the morning.

2246
02:06:37.12 --> 02:06:39.68
And they're like, 10 to go.

2247
02:06:39.68 --> 02:06:43.08
That was like, Jesus, who the hot.

2248
02:06:43.08 --> 02:06:46.76
And because at that point, I had no clue what the current was like.

2249
02:06:46.76 --> 02:06:48.72
Because the swimmer can't feel current.

2250
02:06:48.72 --> 02:06:50.52
Swimmers can only feel relative velocity,

2251
02:06:50.52 --> 02:06:52.52
not absolute velocity.

2252
02:06:52.52 --> 02:06:57.64
So that coupled with the torn labrum, coupled with,

2253
02:06:57.64 --> 02:07:00.84
it ended up being over 14 hours of swimming.

2254
02:07:00.84 --> 02:07:03.72
And this is a very long story because your question was so simple.

2255
02:07:03.72 --> 02:07:05.92
But I remember getting on the boat.

2256
02:07:05.92 --> 02:07:07.20
I don't even remember my question.

2257
02:07:07.20 --> 02:07:08.88
Your question was about nutrition.

2258
02:07:08.88 --> 02:07:11.56
We've actually about, about like, when I finally decided.

2259
02:07:11.56 --> 02:07:15.000
I was over here in bio-loom and essence mail.

2260
02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.56
I mean, OK, so this is the day.

2261
02:07:17.56 --> 02:07:18.96
So finish the swim.

2262
02:07:18.96 --> 02:07:21.12
Get back to the boat.

2263
02:07:21.12 --> 02:07:25.68
And they've got like two burgers and two coax waiting for me.

2264
02:07:25.68 --> 02:07:28.08
And I mean, like I couldn't have eaten those things quicker.

2265
02:07:28.08 --> 02:07:30.44
Like the biggest juiciest burgers you've ever seen.

2266
02:07:30.44 --> 02:07:33.72
Like the coax, like they tasted so good, right?

2267
02:07:33.72 --> 02:07:35.08
Because your mouth is so salty.

2268
02:07:35.08 --> 02:07:37.32
Like you actually really want some sweet.

2269
02:07:37.32 --> 02:07:40.56
And my wife, my wife hates when I tell this story

2270
02:07:40.56 --> 02:07:45.04
because she denies that she said it, but she completely said it.

2271
02:07:45.04 --> 02:07:46.64
She, I'm just sitting there.

2272
02:07:46.64 --> 02:07:47.60
Like, I remember this.

2273
02:07:47.60 --> 02:07:48.44
I haven't picked it up.

2274
02:07:48.44 --> 02:07:49.76
Enjoy the burger fatty.

2275
02:07:49.76 --> 02:07:50.92
All right.

2276
02:07:50.92 --> 02:07:53.56
I've got like a USA towel wrapped around my waist

2277
02:07:53.56 --> 02:07:56.28
and hailing like I'm two-fisting burgers

2278
02:07:56.28 --> 02:07:57.44
drinking my coax.

2279
02:07:57.44 --> 02:08:00.12
And she just looks at me and she goes, and again,

2280
02:08:00.12 --> 02:08:02.64
just in the sweetest way possible.

2281
02:08:02.64 --> 02:08:08.64
She said, you should probably work on being a little less not thin.

2282
02:08:08.64 --> 02:08:09.64
Wow.

2283
02:08:09.64 --> 02:08:10.64
Wow.

2284
02:08:10.64 --> 02:08:13.32
It's less.

2285
02:08:13.32 --> 02:08:16.92
Is that like the kindest way to just tell somebody

2286
02:08:16.92 --> 02:08:18.44
you're kind of getting a little fat?

2287
02:08:18.44 --> 02:08:19.44
Wow.

2288
02:08:19.44 --> 02:08:20.76
Post 14 hours swim.

2289
02:08:20.76 --> 02:08:23.08
You're hoping that it's get some.

2290
02:08:23.08 --> 02:08:26.52
So that was the last time I had a coke.

2291
02:08:26.52 --> 02:08:28.28
I've never had a coke since.

2292
02:08:28.28 --> 02:08:29.84
Tame.

2293
02:08:29.84 --> 02:08:31.88
And all I did, frankly, at the time, was just said,

2294
02:08:31.88 --> 02:08:33.76
like I'm just going to try and experiment.

2295
02:08:33.76 --> 02:08:35.28
Because I was like, look, at that time,

2296
02:08:35.28 --> 02:08:37.40
I still thought it was just calories and calories out.

2297
02:08:37.40 --> 02:08:38.88
I thought it was really just simple arithmetic.

2298
02:08:38.88 --> 02:08:41.96
And my view was, all right, I can't do anything more

2299
02:08:41.96 --> 02:08:43.88
on the calories outside.

2300
02:08:43.88 --> 02:08:45.36
There's only 168 hours in a week.

2301
02:08:45.36 --> 02:08:47.84
I'm not willing to exercise more than 28 of them.

2302
02:08:47.84 --> 02:08:49.24
So calories out.

2303
02:08:49.24 --> 02:08:51.04
I don't get to change that anymore.

2304
02:08:51.04 --> 02:08:53.000
And frankly, I didn't really want to change the calories

2305
02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:54.44
inside because I hated being hungry.

2306
02:08:54.44 --> 02:08:55.64
Every time I tried to eat less,

2307
02:08:55.64 --> 02:08:58.12
I would just be so hungry I didn't know what to do with myself.

2308
02:08:58.12 --> 02:08:59.92
So it was like, I'm going to try a new experiment.

2309
02:08:59.92 --> 02:09:04.16
What if it's the type of calorie that might matter?

2310
02:09:04.16 --> 02:09:07.44
Sugar strikes me as not great for you.

2311
02:09:07.44 --> 02:09:10.48
Even though I can't tell you why,

2312
02:09:10.48 --> 02:09:12.36
I'm going to stop having sugar.

2313
02:09:12.36 --> 02:09:14.88
So that was my first experiment in September of 09.

2314
02:09:14.88 --> 02:09:18.24
And that led to everything that's come since that time.

2315
02:09:18.24 --> 02:09:20.48
Which obviously ultimately led to me coming back to medicine

2316
02:09:20.48 --> 02:09:21.32
as well.

2317
02:09:21.32 --> 02:09:22.000
Yeah.

2318
02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.08
And that's where you're at now.

2319
02:09:24.08 --> 02:09:28.72
And by the way, listen to Tim Tim's podcast.

2320
02:09:28.72 --> 02:09:31.84
What else did people listen to to get all that nutritional

2321
02:09:31.84 --> 02:09:35.96
information the rest of the story?

2322
02:09:35.96 --> 02:09:36.96
I think it's Tim's.

2323
02:09:36.96 --> 02:09:37.48
Yeah.

2324
02:09:37.48 --> 02:09:39.16
I mean, a couple of things with Tim.

2325
02:09:39.16 --> 02:09:44.28
I did a podcast with Chris Krasser earlier this year.

2326
02:09:44.28 --> 02:09:46.04
Talked about longevity a little bit.

2327
02:09:46.04 --> 02:09:46.68
I did one.

2328
02:09:46.68 --> 02:09:48.52
I probably have a, maybe, oh, you know what?

2329
02:09:48.52 --> 02:09:49.72
Probably get more into nutrition.

2330
02:09:49.72 --> 02:09:52.04
There's an IHMC video I did.

2331
02:09:52.04 --> 02:09:53.84
Probably like three or four years ago.

2332
02:09:53.84 --> 02:09:55.24
That one's like an hour long.

2333
02:09:55.24 --> 02:09:56.72
And you go pretty detailed in it.

2334
02:09:56.72 --> 02:09:57.24
Yep.

2335
02:09:57.24 --> 02:09:57.60
OK.

2336
02:09:57.60 --> 02:09:57.80
Yeah.

2337
02:09:57.80 --> 02:09:59.64
I've watched that one.

2338
02:09:59.64 --> 02:10:00.48
Yeah, those are good.

2339
02:10:00.48 --> 02:10:03.04
Those are good.

2340
02:10:03.04 --> 02:10:09.04
And again, if you had to kind of tell people that aren't going

2341
02:10:09.04 --> 02:10:09.96
to go listen to those podcasts,

2342
02:10:09.96 --> 02:10:14.32
and aren't going to watch that video, what would you tell them?

2343
02:10:14.32 --> 02:10:19.32
You know, what would you tell them to eat overall?

2344
02:10:19.32 --> 02:10:22.32
You know, I generally don't like talking about nutrition

2345
02:10:22.32 --> 02:10:25.64
because, don't worry, I will answer this question.

2346
02:10:25.64 --> 02:10:26.88
But I don't at least preface it.

2347
02:10:26.88 --> 02:10:27.84
Why I don't like it.

2348
02:10:27.84 --> 02:10:29.04
I don't like talking about this stuff.

2349
02:10:32.04 --> 02:10:36.76
Nutrition is kind of a pseudo science that masquerades

2350
02:10:36.76 --> 02:10:39.48
as a religion for many people.

2351
02:10:39.48 --> 02:10:43.44
And so I find it difficult to have a discussion

2352
02:10:43.44 --> 02:10:48.84
about biochemistry when it's so cloaked in emotion, religion,

2353
02:10:48.84 --> 02:10:50.64
and dogma.

2354
02:10:50.64 --> 02:10:52.80
No, that's not to say I don't have a strong point of view.

2355
02:10:52.80 --> 02:10:53.92
I certainly do.

2356
02:10:53.92 --> 02:10:55.40
It's also an evolving point of view.

2357
02:10:55.40 --> 02:10:58.80
I feel different today than I felt four or five years ago.

2358
02:10:58.80 --> 02:11:01.000
I feel different today than I felt two years ago.

2359
02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.80
And also, my life is one big experiment.

2360
02:11:03.80 --> 02:11:06.20
So we were joking before I came in here.

2361
02:11:06.20 --> 02:11:08.68
I've got a glucose meter buried within me at the moment.

2362
02:11:08.68 --> 02:11:11.24
I've got all these heart rate variability things.

2363
02:11:11.24 --> 02:11:16.000
Like everything I'm doing, actually, just check.

2364
02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.84
Actually, didn't experiment before I came here today.

2365
02:11:17.84 --> 02:11:22.60
I ate something and I want to see how much it raised my blood sugar.

2366
02:11:24.88 --> 02:11:26.16
That's not bad.

2367
02:11:26.16 --> 02:11:27.40
What did you eat?

2368
02:11:27.40 --> 02:11:31.44
So I ate this product that I've been doing some research on.

2369
02:11:31.44 --> 02:11:36.44
It's called no KNOW like no foods.

2370
02:11:36.44 --> 02:11:40.44
And I was introduced to this product by one of my patients

2371
02:11:40.44 --> 02:11:42.48
who said, hey, Peter, I want you to kick the tires

2372
02:11:42.48 --> 02:11:44.04
on this a little bit.

2373
02:11:44.04 --> 02:11:49.44
It uses a sugar substitute called aliulose.

2374
02:11:49.44 --> 02:11:52.36
And it tastes amazing and apparently, like,

2375
02:11:52.36 --> 02:11:54.28
it doesn't raise your blood sugar at all.

2376
02:11:54.28 --> 02:11:57.64
And I was like, yeah, I'm familiar with aliulose

2377
02:11:57.64 --> 02:11:59.44
for those who might not know.

2378
02:11:59.44 --> 02:12:04.08
Aliulose is a sugar that occurs in nature

2379
02:12:04.08 --> 02:12:09.08
in very small quantities that looks exactly like this sugar

2380
02:12:09.08 --> 02:12:10.88
called fructose, which is fructose,

2381
02:12:10.88 --> 02:12:14.60
the sweet component of sugar with one small exception.

2382
02:12:14.60 --> 02:12:17.92
But that one small exception carries with it some very important things.

2383
02:12:17.92 --> 02:12:20.24
One, it's not quite as sweet as fructose.

2384
02:12:20.24 --> 02:12:22.32
It's about 70% of sweet.

2385
02:12:22.32 --> 02:12:24.08
But by giving up that little bit of that sweetness,

2386
02:12:24.08 --> 02:12:25.40
you get a whole bunch of stuff in return.

2387
02:12:25.40 --> 02:12:27.84
First of all, it's not metabolized by the liver,

2388
02:12:27.84 --> 02:12:29.72
which is the real problem of fructose, too.

2389
02:12:29.72 --> 02:12:31.28
You barely absorb it.

2390
02:12:31.28 --> 02:12:35.72
So 99% of it or more or less is excreted by the kidneys.

2391
02:12:35.72 --> 02:12:39.56
And three, it actually seems to lower blood glucose.

2392
02:12:39.56 --> 02:12:44.56
So this company, no foods, is putting this,

2393
02:12:44.56 --> 02:12:46.96
like, making stuff out of this,

2394
02:12:46.96 --> 02:12:50.36
but stuff that is like, carb-y, bread and waffles

2395
02:12:50.36 --> 02:12:51.80
and muffins and stuff.

2396
02:12:51.80 --> 02:12:54.32
So anyway, to make a long story short,

2397
02:12:54.32 --> 02:12:55.36
I'm at this patient's house,

2398
02:12:55.36 --> 02:12:56.64
and he's force feeding me these things,

2399
02:12:56.64 --> 02:12:58.04
which is really my way of saying,

2400
02:12:58.04 --> 02:13:00.80
he's left the bag open, and I'm inhaling them.

2401
02:13:00.80 --> 02:13:02.80
And he's like, yeah, yeah, you've got to,

2402
02:13:02.80 --> 02:13:04.64
you've got to tell me if this stuff's legit.

2403
02:13:04.64 --> 02:13:05.84
So to make a long story short,

2404
02:13:05.84 --> 02:13:08.60
he plugs me into the guy that flew down to the company.

2405
02:13:08.60 --> 02:13:10.44
And he has sent me a bunch of this stuff

2406
02:13:10.44 --> 02:13:13.40
to just play with, because he knows what I do.

2407
02:13:13.40 --> 02:13:14.40
And so that's what I've been doing.

2408
02:13:14.40 --> 02:13:17.40
So today, I normally don't eat breakfast.

2409
02:13:17.40 --> 02:13:20.12
So I worked out this morning, and then before I came here,

2410
02:13:20.12 --> 02:13:22.84
I had a big piece of their toast,

2411
02:13:22.84 --> 02:13:24.40
covered in almond butter,

2412
02:13:24.40 --> 02:13:26.68
and then two of their huge waffles

2413
02:13:26.68 --> 02:13:28.80
covered with almond butter and bananas.

2414
02:13:28.80 --> 02:13:30.60
Like I made a big sandwich out of that.

2415
02:13:30.60 --> 02:13:34.12
So the almond butter, not gonna have a huge glycemic response

2416
02:13:34.12 --> 02:13:35.60
because it's got so much fat and protein.

2417
02:13:35.60 --> 02:13:37.92
But the bananas should skyrocket my blood sugar.

2418
02:13:37.92 --> 02:13:39.68
I can't imagine the two freaking waffles

2419
02:13:39.68 --> 02:13:41.64
the size of my head and the piece of toast.

2420
02:13:41.64 --> 02:13:45.40
So interestingly, so that was at nine o'clock

2421
02:13:45.40 --> 02:13:47.08
that I ate those.

2422
02:13:47.08 --> 02:13:50.56
Now I've been up since 330, but I didn't eat anything.

2423
02:13:50.56 --> 02:13:53.08
I worked out from seven to eight.

2424
02:13:53.08 --> 02:13:55.32
So admittedly, there's a bit of a glycogen debt.

2425
02:13:55.32 --> 02:13:58.24
So at nine o'clock, when I ingested,

2426
02:13:58.24 --> 02:14:02.92
my blood glucose was 65, and at its peak,

2427
02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.88
which was 11, 18 AM, it was up to 90.

2428
02:14:07.88 --> 02:14:09.20
And it's now down to 83.

2429
02:14:09.20 --> 02:14:11.20
What would real waffles have done to you?

2430
02:14:11.20 --> 02:14:14.60
I think they would have sent me to like 140.

2431
02:14:14.60 --> 02:14:19.000
Three huge pieces of bread slash waffle with the full banana.

2432
02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.000
So anyway, I've been doing these experiments all week,

2433
02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.08
which is just a great excuse to eat this stuff.

2434
02:14:24.08 --> 02:14:25.56
And I'm actually surprised.

2435
02:14:25.56 --> 02:14:26.96
I'm kind of blown away.

2436
02:14:26.96 --> 02:14:28.80
So okay, with all that said,

2437
02:14:28.80 --> 02:14:30.68
what's my advice for what people should eat?

2438
02:14:33.36 --> 02:14:36.24
In an ideal world, everybody would have this thing embedded

2439
02:14:36.24 --> 02:14:37.28
in them like I do.

2440
02:14:37.28 --> 02:14:39.08
This thing is called a Dexcom G5.

2441
02:14:39.08 --> 02:14:40.76
It's a continuous glucose monitor.

2442
02:14:43.20 --> 02:14:45.92
Typically, only used by people with type one diabetes.

2443
02:14:47.12 --> 02:14:49.08
We're now starting to see people with type two diabetes

2444
02:14:49.08 --> 02:14:53.16
where of them, but I was really completely lucky

2445
02:14:53.16 --> 02:14:55.92
one day sitting on an airplane next to a dude,

2446
02:14:55.92 --> 02:14:57.60
who happened to be into watches.

2447
02:14:57.60 --> 02:14:58.44
I'm into watches.

2448
02:14:58.44 --> 02:14:59.60
We've got talking about watches.

2449
02:14:59.60 --> 02:15:01.08
I find out he's the CEO of the company

2450
02:15:01.08 --> 02:15:04.000
that makes this thing the rest of history, right?

2451
02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:05.80
I'm obsessed with this stuff.

2452
02:15:05.80 --> 02:15:10.04
And so because the answer is this, right?

2453
02:15:10.04 --> 02:15:11.92
If you were a computer program, I would say,

2454
02:15:11.92 --> 02:15:15.44
Jaco, eat whatever you want to eat,

2455
02:15:15.44 --> 02:15:19.72
such that your average blood glucose remains below 85

2456
02:15:19.72 --> 02:15:22.68
milligrams per desoliter and your standard deviation,

2457
02:15:22.68 --> 02:15:25.24
below 10 milligrams per desoliter.

2458
02:15:25.24 --> 02:15:26.96
So translate that into English.

2459
02:15:26.96 --> 02:15:27.64
Okay.

2460
02:15:27.64 --> 02:15:31.36
So eat in whatever way your genetics and epigenetics

2461
02:15:31.36 --> 02:15:34.40
permit you to, such that your glucose levels

2462
02:15:34.40 --> 02:15:37.84
stay low and the variability stays low.

2463
02:15:37.84 --> 02:15:40.000
And those two things will ensure

2464
02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.92
that your insulin level stay low.

2465
02:15:41.92 --> 02:15:44.36
So what I'm trying to do is optimize for something called

2466
02:15:44.36 --> 02:15:47.52
the insulin AUC or area under the curve.

2467
02:15:47.52 --> 02:15:49.88
Now we can't measure that test clinically.

2468
02:15:49.88 --> 02:15:52.04
Now let me make it measure that as put you in a hospital,

2469
02:15:52.04 --> 02:15:53.76
put a central line in your neck

2470
02:15:53.76 --> 02:15:56.96
and excuse me, sample your blood every 30 minutes

2471
02:15:56.96 --> 02:16:00.28
over the course of a day where you somehow act normally.

2472
02:16:00.28 --> 02:16:01.12
And every day.

2473
02:16:01.12 --> 02:16:03.36
So then I'd have a time axis, y-axis,

2474
02:16:03.36 --> 02:16:06.04
sorry, the x-axis would be time, the y-axis would be

2475
02:16:06.04 --> 02:16:07.80
insulin level and we'd generate a curve

2476
02:16:07.80 --> 02:16:10.40
and we'd calculate the area under that curve

2477
02:16:10.40 --> 02:16:12.76
and we want that number to be as low as possible.

2478
02:16:12.76 --> 02:16:15.16
So we can't do that outside of the research setting.

2479
02:16:15.16 --> 02:16:18.56
So then the next best thing is keep your average glucose

2480
02:16:18.56 --> 02:16:20.88
as low as possible and the variability.

2481
02:16:20.88 --> 02:16:23.96
So you could have an average glucose of 100

2482
02:16:23.96 --> 02:16:26.92
with low variability and that actually wouldn't produce

2483
02:16:26.92 --> 02:16:30.92
that much insulin or you could have a glucose of 100

2484
02:16:30.92 --> 02:16:34.04
with high variability, same average glucose,

2485
02:16:34.04 --> 02:16:36.16
higher variability is gonna have higher insulin

2486
02:16:36.16 --> 02:16:37.48
all things equal.

2487
02:16:37.48 --> 02:16:40.88
So just through empirical testing in myself

2488
02:16:40.88 --> 02:16:43.04
over the past year and a half,

2489
02:16:43.04 --> 02:16:45.80
I've realized that an average blood glucose

2490
02:16:45.80 --> 02:16:49.40
and this thing tells me every time I hit click,

2491
02:16:49.40 --> 02:16:51.68
like it gives me my last 14 days,

2492
02:16:52.68 --> 02:16:55.28
I just realized like for my average to be below 85

2493
02:16:55.28 --> 02:16:59.28
and my standard deviation to be below 10 is like super dialed in.

2494
02:16:59.28 --> 02:17:04.28
So what you can eat to achieve that varies tremendously

2495
02:17:05.04 --> 02:17:06.76
by individual.

2496
02:17:06.76 --> 02:17:08.16
You know, there are some people who just dispose

2497
02:17:08.16 --> 02:17:09.16
of glucose from our company.

2498
02:17:09.16 --> 02:17:11.52
So that blood test we're gonna do in you next week

2499
02:17:11.52 --> 02:17:15.16
is going to be our best test at measuring that.

2500
02:17:16.68 --> 02:17:20.36
And so glucose disposal is mostly a function

2501
02:17:20.36 --> 02:17:22.92
of the insulin sensitivity of the muscle

2502
02:17:22.92 --> 02:17:25.20
because the muscle is where we dispose

2503
02:17:25.20 --> 02:17:26.96
of the majority of glucose.

2504
02:17:26.96 --> 02:17:30.44
But it's more a little more complicated than that, right?

2505
02:17:30.44 --> 02:17:32.64
Sleep impacts that.

2506
02:17:32.64 --> 02:17:37.64
So sleep deprivation makes us more insulin resistant.

2507
02:17:37.64 --> 02:17:39.96
So this has been experimentally demonstrated

2508
02:17:39.96 --> 02:17:42.60
even with two weeks of sleep deprivation.

2509
02:17:42.60 --> 02:17:45.96
So there's a, it's a small but very well controlled experiment

2510
02:17:45.96 --> 02:17:48.32
that was done out of University of Chicago

2511
02:17:48.32 --> 02:17:49.80
price six years ago.

2512
02:17:49.80 --> 02:17:51.92
They took a very small number of subjects,

2513
02:17:51.92 --> 02:17:53.36
like I said, about eight subjects

2514
02:17:53.36 --> 02:17:57.76
and for two weeks let them only sleep four hours a night

2515
02:17:57.76 --> 02:18:01.64
and they did a very invasive test called a Uglysi

2516
02:18:01.64 --> 02:18:03.84
McKinsey-Lun Clamp at the beginning and at the end

2517
02:18:03.84 --> 02:18:07.84
of the experiment and their insulin sensitivity,

2518
02:18:07.84 --> 02:18:10.72
their glucose disposal deteriorated by 50%.

2519
02:18:10.72 --> 02:18:13.20
And with no change in what they were eating.

2520
02:18:13.20 --> 02:18:14.20
Yeah.

2521
02:18:14.20 --> 02:18:18.12
So it's highly variable, right?

2522
02:18:18.12 --> 02:18:20.56
So that's theoretically the answer.

2523
02:18:20.56 --> 02:18:25.36
On a practical level, I would say the answer is this, right?

2524
02:18:25.36 --> 02:18:29.84
If it comes in a package, you're probably better off not eating it,

2525
02:18:29.84 --> 02:18:31.24
right?

2526
02:18:31.24 --> 02:18:36.72
If your ancestors couldn't have eaten this even 200 years ago,

2527
02:18:36.72 --> 02:18:39.64
it's probably not worth eating.

2528
02:18:39.64 --> 02:18:42.64
So if you just followed that advice,

2529
02:18:42.64 --> 02:18:46.12
think about how many things you'd eliminate from your diet,

2530
02:18:46.12 --> 02:18:46.80
right?

2531
02:18:46.80 --> 02:18:49.92
If you just took packaged foods away from your diet,

2532
02:18:49.92 --> 02:18:51.80
and again, notice I'm agnostic.

2533
02:18:51.80 --> 02:18:53.48
You want to be a vegan, not yourself out.

2534
02:18:53.48 --> 02:18:55.40
You want to be the paleo man of the century?

2535
02:18:55.40 --> 02:18:56.24
Go for it.

2536
02:18:56.24 --> 02:18:57.32
I don't get a shunt.

2537
02:18:57.32 --> 02:18:58.16
Okay.

2538
02:18:58.16 --> 02:19:00.44
I couldn't care less, right?

2539
02:19:00.44 --> 02:19:03.08
But if you can largely adhere to those principles,

2540
02:19:03.08 --> 02:19:05.20
you're kind of going to be fine.

2541
02:19:05.20 --> 02:19:08.16
Do you want, you know, you're going to get 70% of the way there.

2542
02:19:08.16 --> 02:19:10.12
You want to get 80, 90, 100% of the way there?

2543
02:19:10.12 --> 02:19:11.92
Yeah, well then there is no simple answer.

2544
02:19:11.92 --> 02:19:13.48
Now at that point, you got a dial in

2545
02:19:13.48 --> 02:19:16.04
and you got to go full immersion into

2546
02:19:16.04 --> 02:19:18.52
how do you tweak to your biochemistry?

2547
02:19:18.52 --> 02:19:20.96
How much protein, what's the timing of the meals?

2548
02:19:20.96 --> 02:19:21.96
When do we fast?

2549
02:19:21.96 --> 02:19:25.64
I mean, all of the stuff that is my world

2550
02:19:25.64 --> 02:19:28.32
and maybe soon to be your world,

2551
02:19:28.32 --> 02:19:33.32
that's the stuff for which you cannot provide,

2552
02:19:33.32 --> 02:19:34.80
you know, systemic advice.

2553
02:19:34.80 --> 02:19:38.92
But at the societal level or at the just the most basic level,

2554
02:19:38.92 --> 02:19:40.000
yeah, I mean, think about that advice.

2555
02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:41.88
Like you don't eat sugar anymore.

2556
02:19:41.88 --> 02:19:44.12
You won't eat refined carbohydrates anymore.

2557
02:19:44.12 --> 02:19:47.08
You're not going to eat processed crappy foods anymore.

2558
02:19:47.08 --> 02:19:48.08
What are you going to eat?

2559
02:19:48.08 --> 02:19:48.92
You're going to eat fruits.

2560
02:19:48.92 --> 02:19:49.76
You're going to eat vegetables.

2561
02:19:49.76 --> 02:19:50.76
You're going to eat meat.

2562
02:19:50.76 --> 02:19:52.12
You're going to eat grain.

2563
02:19:52.12 --> 02:19:53.40
What kind of grains are you going to eat?

2564
02:19:53.40 --> 02:19:57.44
Well, you're not going to really eat these refined crappy grains

2565
02:19:57.44 --> 02:19:58.44
that people eat.

2566
02:19:58.44 --> 02:20:00.40
You're going to, you know, your starches, I'm sorry, not grains.

2567
02:20:00.40 --> 02:20:02.16
Your starches are probably going to be in the form of potatoes

2568
02:20:02.16 --> 02:20:03.36
and rice.

2569
02:20:03.36 --> 02:20:07.80
So again, I just, I sort of, I think the reason I like talking

2570
02:20:07.80 --> 02:20:10.24
about nutrition anymore is I don't find it to be

2571
02:20:10.24 --> 02:20:12.68
intellectually honest, discussion anymore.

2572
02:20:12.68 --> 02:20:14.76
I find it to be just a discussion of dogma, right?

2573
02:20:14.76 --> 02:20:16.96
So if you're a low carb camp, you're a low carb camp.

2574
02:20:16.96 --> 02:20:20.92
If you're in the, you know, whatever the vegan camp, you're in the vegan camp.

2575
02:20:20.92 --> 02:20:24.60
Like there's that you can't even have a discussion about this stuff.

2576
02:20:24.60 --> 02:20:27.32
And at least not with most people.

2577
02:20:27.32 --> 02:20:28.32
Yeah.

2578
02:20:28.32 --> 02:20:31.64
So I, you know, you ever read the book called Diet Cults?

2579
02:20:31.64 --> 02:20:32.64
I know.

2580
02:20:32.64 --> 02:20:33.64
So it's getting to the non-sense.

2581
02:20:33.64 --> 02:20:35.64
What you said right there?

2582
02:20:35.64 --> 02:20:36.64
That's the whole book.

2583
02:20:36.64 --> 02:20:38.04
Really so interesting.

2584
02:20:38.04 --> 02:20:39.04
Fondery too.

2585
02:20:39.04 --> 02:20:40.04
So good.

2586
02:20:40.04 --> 02:20:42.04
I will have to check that out.

2587
02:20:42.04 --> 02:20:43.04
Diet Cults.

2588
02:20:43.04 --> 02:20:46.80
Now I kind of open with this and since we're, since we're

2589
02:20:46.80 --> 02:20:54.32
a little over two hours right now, I said that you're probably the most

2590
02:20:54.32 --> 02:20:58.92
responsible individual for this podcast.

2591
02:20:58.92 --> 02:21:06.60
And because you originally through Kirk set me up to do a podcast with

2592
02:21:06.60 --> 02:21:10.44
Tim Ferriss, which sent me up to do a podcast with Joe Rogan, which was just

2593
02:21:10.44 --> 02:21:11.68
all awesome.

2594
02:21:11.68 --> 02:21:13.88
And both of those guys told me I should do my own podcast.

2595
02:21:13.88 --> 02:21:16.68
So anyone that's listening to this podcast, say

2596
02:21:16.68 --> 02:21:18.32
thanks to Peter for that.

2597
02:21:18.32 --> 02:21:19.32
Thanks.

2598
02:21:19.32 --> 02:21:20.64
Actually, they should thank Kirk, right?

2599
02:21:20.64 --> 02:21:21.64
Yeah, Kirk.

2600
02:21:21.64 --> 02:21:22.64
Kirk was the man.

2601
02:21:22.64 --> 02:21:25.96
You know, I mean, Kirk is, I don't need to tell you, but Kirk's one of those

2602
02:21:25.96 --> 02:21:30.12
guys where like he doesn't have to justify an ask, right?

2603
02:21:30.12 --> 02:21:33.36
So when he introduced me to you, he didn't have to explain.

2604
02:21:33.36 --> 02:21:36.24
He was just like, I want you to meet Jocco, Jocco as my friend.

2605
02:21:36.24 --> 02:21:37.64
It was like, that's good enough.

2606
02:21:37.64 --> 02:21:41.76
And so to me, like, that's the measure of when life is good.

2607
02:21:41.76 --> 02:21:44.76
And because I feel that way with all of my friends, like if Tim introduces me to

2608
02:21:44.76 --> 02:21:47.72
somebody, like Tim's introduced me to like a dozen people, it doesn't

2609
02:21:47.72 --> 02:21:50.04
amazing relationships have come out of that, right?

2610
02:21:50.04 --> 02:21:55.64
And so, you know, really it was just very easy for me to sort of take Kirk

2611
02:21:55.64 --> 02:21:59.08
on his word that like, if Jocco's great guy, then that's all I need to know.

2612
02:21:59.08 --> 02:22:00.48
I knew you're going to be a great guy.

2613
02:22:00.48 --> 02:22:04.36
And then similarly, like I could tell Tim, like, hey, you got to meet Jocco.

2614
02:22:04.36 --> 02:22:07.28
And you know, Tim gets quote unquote pitched all day long.

2615
02:22:07.28 --> 02:22:08.28
Yeah, it does.

2616
02:22:08.28 --> 02:22:12.48
But, you know, he knows that I'm not going to send him somebody that's not

2617
02:22:12.48 --> 02:22:16.76
you know, going to be really interesting and going to benefit his listeners, not

2618
02:22:16.76 --> 02:22:19.48
just, you know, whatever agenda that person might have.

2619
02:22:19.48 --> 02:22:20.48
Yeah.

2620
02:22:20.48 --> 02:22:21.48
Yeah.

2621
02:22:21.48 --> 02:22:22.48
No, it was awesome.

2622
02:22:22.48 --> 02:22:28.20
And that really did him in the way, Tim, the way Tim advised the way he was going

2623
02:22:28.20 --> 02:22:30.48
to release the podcast to know and support the public.

2624
02:22:30.48 --> 02:22:31.92
I mean, he just nailed it.

2625
02:22:31.92 --> 02:22:36.000
It was kind of ridiculous the way he understands that stuff.

2626
02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:40.28
And how helpful it was to, you know, get in our book out there and get in its

2627
02:22:40.28 --> 02:22:44.76
old and all that and get in all these people on board and then, you know, that turned

2628
02:22:44.76 --> 02:22:49.96
into this podcast, which, you know, he definitely has promoted the podcast and a fantastic

2629
02:22:49.96 --> 02:22:51.20
way along with Joe.

2630
02:22:51.20 --> 02:22:52.20
So that's both been awesome.

2631
02:22:52.20 --> 02:22:56.64
But again, start with Kirk, connect to me with you and then you connect to me with

2632
02:22:56.64 --> 02:22:57.64
Tim.

2633
02:22:57.64 --> 02:22:59.84
So I appreciate that.

2634
02:22:59.84 --> 02:23:09.68
And speaking of this podcast, my almost silent partner over here at Coach Charles, if

2635
02:23:09.68 --> 02:23:14.76
somebody wants to support the podcast, how would you recommend they go ahead and do that?

2636
02:23:14.76 --> 02:23:17.76
You always have a question.

2637
02:23:17.76 --> 02:23:21.76
Oh, how'd you hurt your back originally?

2638
02:23:21.76 --> 02:23:25.32
You know, I don't think we ever really have a diagnosis.

2639
02:23:25.32 --> 02:23:31.16
There was certainly nothing on that day that I did that day I've ride my bike to the gym.

2640
02:23:31.16 --> 02:23:35.44
I, you know, I think about the sins of my youth.

2641
02:23:35.44 --> 02:23:41.92
You know, I was really into martial arts in addition to boxing and I used to spend a ton

2642
02:23:41.92 --> 02:23:42.92
of time.

2643
02:23:42.92 --> 02:23:45.52
I was really obsessed with spinning back kicks.

2644
02:23:45.52 --> 02:23:48.76
Now, I don't know if that could have done it or not.

2645
02:23:48.76 --> 02:23:53.92
But I used to practice 75 spinning back kicks with each leg every single day for probably

2646
02:23:53.92 --> 02:23:57.24
about six years, seven years.

2647
02:23:57.24 --> 02:24:00.44
It's possible, even though in theory, it's spinning back kick if done correctly, it should

2648
02:24:00.44 --> 02:24:02.84
really not put any torque on the lower back.

2649
02:24:02.84 --> 02:24:06.96
It's much more in your hips and technically the flexibilities and the thoracic spine, not

2650
02:24:06.96 --> 02:24:07.96
the lumbar spine.

2651
02:24:07.96 --> 02:24:12.08
But, you know, God knows, maybe I just wasn't doing those things correctly.

2652
02:24:12.08 --> 02:24:14.12
I did squat and deadlift really heavy growing up.

2653
02:24:14.12 --> 02:24:16.72
I did powerlifting and sort of a side sport.

2654
02:24:16.72 --> 02:24:21.44
But, you know, certainly never hurt myself doing that.

2655
02:24:21.44 --> 02:24:23.36
I rode crew for a year.

2656
02:24:23.36 --> 02:24:28.04
And so I always, I'm always wondering if that was the most destructive thing I did because

2657
02:24:28.04 --> 02:24:30.60
in an eight man boat, it's eight year asymmetric.

2658
02:24:30.60 --> 02:24:31.60
Right?

2659
02:24:31.60 --> 02:24:34.12
All your symmetric when you sweep you're not.

2660
02:24:34.12 --> 02:24:36.72
And so I was like, I was a sweeper.

2661
02:24:36.72 --> 02:24:40.16
And so I'm always wonder if that's the most destructive thing I ever did.

2662
02:24:40.16 --> 02:24:41.16
Yeah.

2663
02:24:41.16 --> 02:24:45.76
And then you figure if you're asymmetrical like that, your everyday life is asymmetric.

2664
02:24:45.76 --> 02:24:46.76
Really?

2665
02:24:46.76 --> 02:24:48.76
Because you have a little bit of overdevelopment on the side.

2666
02:24:48.76 --> 02:24:49.76
I don't know, I might have been there.

2667
02:24:49.76 --> 02:24:51.24
So I guess I've never really known.

2668
02:24:51.24 --> 02:24:52.44
But I take it really seriously.

2669
02:24:52.44 --> 02:24:56.32
Today, in fact, you know, Jack, you'll dig this.

2670
02:24:56.32 --> 02:25:02.80
Two weeks ago, I did a video in New York with a friend of mine named Jesse Schwarzman.

2671
02:25:02.80 --> 02:25:05.44
And he's like, I call him the Savant of Movement.

2672
02:25:05.44 --> 02:25:08.88
This guy's like, just like the kinesthetic man.

2673
02:25:08.88 --> 02:25:14.96
And I wanted to put a video together of how do you train to train?

2674
02:25:14.96 --> 02:25:16.48
How do you prepare your body to train?

2675
02:25:16.48 --> 02:25:18.08
So it's basically three sections.

2676
02:25:18.08 --> 02:25:22.52
It's what's the sort of dynamic?

2677
02:25:22.52 --> 02:25:26.28
Well, the sort of tissue preparation, the static prep and the dynamic prep.

2678
02:25:26.28 --> 02:25:31.12
It took us eight, not even six hours to shoot this video.

2679
02:25:31.12 --> 02:25:35.16
It'll be edited down into probably three, ten minute videos.

2680
02:25:35.16 --> 02:25:37.96
And as soon as they're done editing, I'm just going to throw them up on YouTube and my blog.

2681
02:25:37.96 --> 02:25:39.84
So I'll make sure you've got a copy.

2682
02:25:39.84 --> 02:25:40.84
Awesome.

2683
02:25:40.84 --> 02:25:45.24
It's, I mean, Jesse's just, you know, he walks me through all the exercises.

2684
02:25:45.24 --> 02:25:49.08
But I get the sense like if I had done that stuff all the way in my life, I probably never

2685
02:25:49.08 --> 02:25:50.08
would've been hurt.

2686
02:25:50.08 --> 02:25:51.08
And luckily, knock on wood to this day.

2687
02:25:51.08 --> 02:25:55.32
I mean, I never thought I'd be able to squat and deadlift again after going through

2688
02:25:55.32 --> 02:25:56.56
that year of my life.

2689
02:25:56.56 --> 02:25:59.36
But amazingly, I'm totally fine.

2690
02:25:59.36 --> 02:26:01.96
And it was a herniated disc that pops off the...

2691
02:26:01.96 --> 02:26:06.000
Yeah, so it was an L5S1 really big herniation.

2692
02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:10.80
But then a four or five centimeter fragment broke off and then floats down the canal.

2693
02:26:10.80 --> 02:26:12.36
And that was sitting on the nerve root.

2694
02:26:12.36 --> 02:26:14.60
And then I developed a few other problems after.

2695
02:26:14.60 --> 02:26:19.32
So I developed this thing called a fissette arthropathy, which resulted in the feeling

2696
02:26:19.32 --> 02:26:22.52
of having my testicles torn out from the inside.

2697
02:26:22.52 --> 02:26:23.52
I'm not even joking.

2698
02:26:23.52 --> 02:26:25.80
It's just so, it's just unbearable.

2699
02:26:25.80 --> 02:26:27.56
Yeah, I would imagine that's unbearable.

2700
02:26:27.56 --> 02:26:28.56
I don't recommend that.

2701
02:26:28.56 --> 02:26:29.56
No.

2702
02:26:29.56 --> 02:26:31.56
All right.

2703
02:26:31.56 --> 02:26:36.80
Well, that being said, yes, we can talk about it.

2704
02:26:36.80 --> 02:26:39.72
So we can talk about on it.

2705
02:26:39.72 --> 02:26:43.92
I was talking with Greg and Terry.

2706
02:26:43.92 --> 02:26:46.84
And I was showing them the warrior bars.

2707
02:26:46.84 --> 02:26:47.84
Right.

2708
02:26:47.84 --> 02:26:48.84
These are dope.

2709
02:26:48.84 --> 02:26:51.28
And then he was like, oh yeah, like what else is there?

2710
02:26:51.28 --> 02:26:52.44
There's some good stuff on it.

2711
02:26:52.44 --> 02:26:53.44
This is good stuff.

2712
02:26:53.44 --> 02:26:57.60
So I brought out that that new pre workout on, which is good by the way, every part of

2713
02:26:57.60 --> 02:26:58.60
that.

2714
02:26:58.60 --> 02:27:02.60
So that one comes out and then the krill oil comes out, oh yeah, this is good for this.

2715
02:27:02.60 --> 02:27:05.000
So we're talking about this big table of like all the stuff.

2716
02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:10.44
It's not a lot of like four things that worry bar, krill oil and the pre workout.

2717
02:27:10.44 --> 02:27:12.44
And three things.

2718
02:27:12.44 --> 02:27:14.68
And work like yeah, this does this and this does this.

2719
02:27:14.68 --> 02:27:19.44
And then I kind of step back and I'm like yeah, we're those guys with all our supplements

2720
02:27:19.44 --> 02:27:21.72
talking about supplements, talking about supplements, right?

2721
02:27:21.72 --> 02:27:22.72
Which I've never done.

2722
02:27:22.72 --> 02:27:28.32
And Greg goes, yeah, if we weren't such nice guys, this would be a real douchey conversation.

2723
02:27:28.32 --> 02:27:36.60
So the kind of the irony there is him saying that he's the one having the douchey conversation,

2724
02:27:36.60 --> 02:27:40.000
but he is the nice guy.

2725
02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:41.000
You get it?

2726
02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:42.000
I guess so.

2727
02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Anyway.

2728
02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:46.72
Point there or actually the second point there is on it is good supplement.

2729
02:27:46.72 --> 02:27:51.52
So if you do talk about them while you're taking them, you're not having a douchey conversation.

2730
02:27:51.52 --> 02:27:56.32
I heard Joe Rogan talking the other day about how hard it is when you're a stand up comedian

2731
02:27:56.32 --> 02:27:58.36
and you tell a joke and it just flat.

2732
02:27:58.36 --> 02:27:59.36
Yeah, I just got it.

2733
02:27:59.36 --> 02:28:01.64
Yeah, but that one here's the thing.

2734
02:28:01.64 --> 02:28:02.64
That's the thing.

2735
02:28:02.64 --> 02:28:03.64
There were, there were.

2736
02:28:03.64 --> 02:28:04.80
I was going to go mercy last.

2737
02:28:04.80 --> 02:28:05.80
But I didn't do it.

2738
02:28:05.80 --> 02:28:06.96
There's a lot of merciful brosod.

2739
02:28:06.96 --> 02:28:10.88
That one, that had joking elements, but this is true in this part of a bigger point that

2740
02:28:10.88 --> 02:28:11.88
I'm making.

2741
02:28:11.88 --> 02:28:12.88
I hope so.

2742
02:28:12.88 --> 02:28:15.52
I don't expect you to laugh at everything I say.

2743
02:28:15.52 --> 02:28:18.84
Even though you create a much too.

2744
02:28:18.84 --> 02:28:20.08
Anyway.

2745
02:28:20.08 --> 02:28:25.88
The reason that it's not a douchey conversation here's the point is because on its supplements,

2746
02:28:25.88 --> 02:28:29.32
the krill oil, all that stuff is actually good quality.

2747
02:28:29.32 --> 02:28:30.60
It's not like, hey, I'm a meathead.

2748
02:28:30.60 --> 02:28:32.32
I'm going to get buffing all this stuff.

2749
02:28:32.32 --> 02:28:34.20
It actually helps your performance.

2750
02:28:34.20 --> 02:28:40.24
Anyway, so in the event of you wanting on it stuff and supporting this podcast, while

2751
02:28:40.24 --> 02:28:43.32
at the same time supporting yourself, go to on it.com slash.

2752
02:28:43.32 --> 02:28:50.24
So 10% off, boom, second way to support Amazon click through.

2753
02:28:50.24 --> 02:28:55.84
Christmas is over, but we still need stuff duct tape, whatever.

2754
02:28:55.84 --> 02:28:58.12
Nice, et cetera.

2755
02:28:58.12 --> 02:29:02.12
If you want to support this podcast, just go to the website, chocopodcast.com, click through

2756
02:29:02.12 --> 02:29:07.96
the Amazon banner link before you do your shopping.

2757
02:29:07.96 --> 02:29:10.000
You can support that way.

2758
02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:14.12
It's a good way to support.

2759
02:29:14.12 --> 02:29:16.32
Yeah, you're in to chemistry, right?

2760
02:29:16.32 --> 02:29:21.04
Sodium, when you put a little piece of sodium in the water, it makes this big commotion.

2761
02:29:21.04 --> 02:29:23.64
So that's what the Amazon click through does.

2762
02:29:23.64 --> 02:29:29.24
It seems like this small little thing, but applied properly, it makes a big impact in

2763
02:29:29.24 --> 02:29:30.24
the podcast.

2764
02:29:30.24 --> 02:29:31.24
Support ways.

2765
02:29:31.24 --> 02:29:32.24
Anyway, thought you'd get...

2766
02:29:32.24 --> 02:29:34.64
Can we verify that, doctor?

2767
02:29:34.64 --> 02:29:39.64
I will have to go and look at the Amazon click through.

2768
02:29:39.64 --> 02:29:43.12
I tell Jocca that he typically doesn't really understand because he doesn't know what sodium

2769
02:29:43.12 --> 02:29:44.12
does.

2770
02:29:44.12 --> 02:29:46.92
It might be in potassium or both actually.

2771
02:29:46.92 --> 02:29:49.60
So now this whole thing has been a lie.

2772
02:29:49.60 --> 02:29:50.60
No, I'm not sure.

2773
02:29:50.60 --> 02:29:52.60
Not an on pretty sure.

2774
02:29:52.60 --> 02:29:54.24
I'm actually fairly sure.

2775
02:29:54.24 --> 02:29:57.16
Pretty sure goes a long way back or I guess.

2776
02:29:57.16 --> 02:29:58.16
Yeah.

2777
02:29:58.16 --> 02:30:05.20
Anyway, you can subscribe to the podcast on iTunes, which seems obvious because typically

2778
02:30:05.20 --> 02:30:07.20
the podcast you listen to, you subscribe to.

2779
02:30:07.20 --> 02:30:13.20
But sometimes you don't subscribe if you have not already and you want to support the

2780
02:30:13.20 --> 02:30:14.20
podcast.

2781
02:30:14.20 --> 02:30:16.88
Google Play, Stitcher, also in the game.

2782
02:30:16.88 --> 02:30:17.88
Yeah.

2783
02:30:17.88 --> 02:30:18.88
And iTunes.

2784
02:30:18.88 --> 02:30:21.96
Yeah, it's kind of unfair that I don't think about that as much.

2785
02:30:21.96 --> 02:30:24.60
You don't want to have an iPhone, like you kind of forget all this other stuff.

2786
02:30:24.60 --> 02:30:25.60
I'm here to help out.

2787
02:30:25.60 --> 02:30:26.60
Yeah, man.

2788
02:30:26.60 --> 02:30:30.88
Good thing you're here on this podcast.

2789
02:30:30.88 --> 02:30:32.68
YouTube, of course.

2790
02:30:32.68 --> 02:30:34.84
We're working on putting more videos on there.

2791
02:30:34.84 --> 02:30:37.84
Aside from the whole podcast.

2792
02:30:37.84 --> 02:30:43.84
So some of those videos and I have gotten like messages saying like those shorter clips

2793
02:30:43.84 --> 02:30:44.84
are helpful.

2794
02:30:44.84 --> 02:30:45.84
They are helpful.

2795
02:30:45.84 --> 02:30:47.84
Rather than listening to the whole podcast.

2796
02:30:47.84 --> 02:30:52.52
And there's been people that have been submitting to you on Twitter, which excerpts

2797
02:30:52.52 --> 02:30:55.84
are in high demand out there in the world.

2798
02:30:55.84 --> 02:30:56.84
Yeah.

2799
02:30:56.84 --> 02:30:57.84
Yeah, I've been following now.

2800
02:30:57.84 --> 02:31:01.28
In fact, to have them all like it's a process.

2801
02:31:01.28 --> 02:31:02.68
But yeah, we're working on that.

2802
02:31:02.68 --> 02:31:03.92
So subscribe to YouTube.

2803
02:31:03.92 --> 02:31:04.92
We are working on that.

2804
02:31:04.92 --> 02:31:05.92
We are.

2805
02:31:05.92 --> 02:31:06.92
We are.

2806
02:31:06.92 --> 02:31:07.92
Collective.

2807
02:31:07.92 --> 02:31:09.92
Just say you guys know I'm not working on it.

2808
02:31:09.92 --> 02:31:11.92
But echo of Barrett Vs, which is cool.

2809
02:31:11.92 --> 02:31:14.92
Well, technically you say, hey, but put this one out.

2810
02:31:14.92 --> 02:31:15.92
Okay.

2811
02:31:15.92 --> 02:31:16.92
I'm hard to tell you.

2812
02:31:16.92 --> 02:31:17.92
Yeah, man, exactly.

2813
02:31:17.92 --> 02:31:22.72
And then in the event of you wearing like what, like a t-shirt or something or hoodie,

2814
02:31:22.72 --> 02:31:24.20
Jockel has a store.

2815
02:31:24.20 --> 02:31:26.92
It's called Jockel Store.

2816
02:31:26.92 --> 02:31:27.92
The URL is Jockel Store.

2817
02:31:27.92 --> 02:31:28.92
Yeah, exactly.

2818
02:31:28.92 --> 02:31:30.92
Is that a calculator watch you there?

2819
02:31:30.92 --> 02:31:32.92
I was going to get to that.

2820
02:31:32.92 --> 02:31:36.92
You mentioned, see now we've got to change subject real quick, which I like, by the way.

2821
02:31:36.92 --> 02:31:38.92
Remember you're talking about your inter watches.

2822
02:31:38.92 --> 02:31:39.92
Yeah.

2823
02:31:39.92 --> 02:31:42.92
I was going to show I didn't want to interrupt what you're saying.

2824
02:31:42.92 --> 02:31:44.92
That is your appreciate.

2825
02:31:44.92 --> 02:31:47.92
That is ridiculous.

2826
02:31:47.92 --> 02:31:50.92
I just ring incorporated this one back.

2827
02:31:50.92 --> 02:31:52.92
What is it, a calculator watch?

2828
02:31:52.92 --> 02:31:53.92
Yeah.

2829
02:31:53.92 --> 02:31:56.92
Actually, one of the first pictures I posted on Twitter was up before the enemy.

2830
02:31:56.92 --> 02:31:59.92
And it was like, you know, Jockel is always like, yeah, 430.

2831
02:31:59.92 --> 02:32:00.92
Which one is at the Casio?

2832
02:32:00.92 --> 02:32:01.92
Yeah, Casio.

2833
02:32:01.92 --> 02:32:02.92
Oh, cool.

2834
02:32:02.92 --> 02:32:07.92
2, 3, 4, 4, 5.

2835
02:32:07.92 --> 02:32:09.92
That watch when I was a kid.

2836
02:32:09.92 --> 02:32:11.92
Like, I would have flizzled some for that.

2837
02:32:11.92 --> 02:32:13.92
Only the cookies had the calculator one.

2838
02:32:13.92 --> 02:32:16.92
Oh, usually if you had a watch, it was just the regular Casio.

2839
02:32:16.92 --> 02:32:18.92
And the cookies had the Calkey.

2840
02:32:18.92 --> 02:32:21.92
I had the first Iron Man.

2841
02:32:21.92 --> 02:32:22.92
Did you?

2842
02:32:22.92 --> 02:32:23.92
Yeah.

2843
02:32:23.92 --> 02:32:25.92
It was black with like a little red trim on it.

2844
02:32:25.92 --> 02:32:27.92
I asked for it for Christmas.

2845
02:32:27.92 --> 02:32:30.92
My parents got it for me, but I knew where they hid presents.

2846
02:32:30.92 --> 02:32:35.92
So every day after school I would go into their room and I would take it out of the box.

2847
02:32:35.92 --> 02:32:37.92
And I would set the time.

2848
02:32:37.92 --> 02:32:38.92
I would wear it.

2849
02:32:38.92 --> 02:32:40.92
I would just hang out there.

2850
02:32:40.92 --> 02:32:43.92
And then before I go to bed, I'd like sneak back, put it in.

2851
02:32:43.92 --> 02:32:46.92
And so like on Christmas Day, it was like I'd been wearing the watch for a month.

2852
02:32:46.92 --> 02:32:48.92
Those are your watch.

2853
02:32:48.92 --> 02:32:50.92
Actually, I think you got it.

2854
02:32:50.92 --> 02:32:51.92
I'm in the watch as soon.

2855
02:32:51.92 --> 02:32:52.92
Yeah.

2856
02:32:52.92 --> 02:32:52.92
Yeah.

2857
02:32:52.92 --> 02:32:54.92
Well, I got one.

2858
02:32:54.92 --> 02:32:56.92
Actually, I got quite a few of these.

2859
02:32:56.92 --> 02:32:58.92
I guess you should have your own brand of watch.

2860
02:32:58.92 --> 02:32:59.92
Yeah.

2861
02:32:59.92 --> 02:33:00.92
We'll see how all that turns out.

2862
02:33:00.92 --> 02:33:01.92
Yeah.

2863
02:33:01.92 --> 02:33:02.92
Yeah.

2864
02:33:02.92 --> 02:33:03.92
I'm not going to listen.

2865
02:33:03.92 --> 02:33:04.92
Yeah.

2866
02:33:04.92 --> 02:33:07.92
I am very proud of this Calkey layer watch.

2867
02:33:07.92 --> 02:33:08.92
Back to the store though.

2868
02:33:08.92 --> 02:33:09.92
Jockel store.

2869
02:33:09.92 --> 02:33:10.92
No watches.

2870
02:33:10.92 --> 02:33:11.92
Yeah.

2871
02:33:11.92 --> 02:33:12.92
Yeah.

2872
02:33:12.92 --> 02:33:13.92
Yeah.

2873
02:33:13.92 --> 02:33:14.92
But there are some cool shirts.

2874
02:33:14.92 --> 02:33:16.92
In my opinion, I think they're cool.

2875
02:33:16.92 --> 02:33:18.92
Displinicals freedom of all these things.

2876
02:33:18.92 --> 02:33:20.92
Jockels had good, written in backwards.

2877
02:33:20.92 --> 02:33:23.92
Various layers to these shirts.

2878
02:33:23.92 --> 02:33:27.92
Not just like, oh, picture that's it.

2879
02:33:27.92 --> 02:33:32.92
So if you like any of that stuff, I'm not even saying go buy this stuff.

2880
02:33:32.92 --> 02:33:33.92
I'm not saying that.

2881
02:33:33.92 --> 02:33:35.92
Just go to the Jockel store.com.

2882
02:33:35.92 --> 02:33:38.92
See, if you like it, if you like it, you won't want to buy one.

2883
02:33:38.92 --> 02:33:41.92
And that's a person podcast.

2884
02:33:41.92 --> 02:33:44.92
You know, it's a systemic thing.

2885
02:33:44.92 --> 02:33:45.92
Good.

2886
02:33:45.92 --> 02:33:46.92
There you go.

2887
02:33:46.92 --> 02:33:47.92
Patches on there as well.

2888
02:33:47.92 --> 02:33:48.92
Rashcards.

2889
02:33:48.92 --> 02:33:50.92
Oh, you know what you didn't mention?

2890
02:33:50.92 --> 02:33:54.92
That you should have mentioned, because apparently it's been pretty cool out there in the world.

2891
02:33:54.92 --> 02:33:55.92
Lain on me.

2892
02:33:55.92 --> 02:33:56.92
Psychological warfare.

2893
02:33:56.92 --> 02:33:57.92
Yeah.

2894
02:33:57.92 --> 02:34:01.92
I didn't mention it this time, but I mentioned it last time.

2895
02:34:01.92 --> 02:34:03.92
And in my everyday life.

2896
02:34:03.92 --> 02:34:04.92
And I use it.

2897
02:34:04.92 --> 02:34:05.92
So there you go.

2898
02:34:05.92 --> 02:34:07.92
Psychological warfare.

2899
02:34:07.92 --> 02:34:08.92
You use it?

2900
02:34:08.92 --> 02:34:09.92
I use it.

2901
02:34:09.92 --> 02:34:10.92
Every day?

2902
02:34:10.92 --> 02:34:11.92
When needed.

2903
02:34:11.92 --> 02:34:12.92
Here's the thing.

2904
02:34:12.92 --> 02:34:13.92
You can't use it every day.

2905
02:34:13.92 --> 02:34:14.92
You know, you can't actually.

2906
02:34:14.92 --> 02:34:15.92
You can't.

2907
02:34:15.92 --> 02:34:16.92
I'm like a say, you can't use it every day.

2908
02:34:16.92 --> 02:34:20.92
But the reason, the whole reason that I was like, hey, Jockel, what do you say?

2909
02:34:20.92 --> 02:34:21.92
You know, when you're.

2910
02:34:21.92 --> 02:34:22.92
Okay, you don't need every day.

2911
02:34:22.92 --> 02:34:23.92
I don't need it every day.

2912
02:34:23.92 --> 02:34:24.92
Okay.

2913
02:34:24.92 --> 02:34:27.92
But it varies, you know, from season to season.

2914
02:34:27.92 --> 02:34:30.92
So like, you know.

2915
02:34:30.92 --> 02:34:37.42
So if you are coming up against moments of weakness, we have a little method to get you over

2916
02:34:37.42 --> 02:34:38.42
to those haunts.

2917
02:34:38.42 --> 02:34:39.42
Yeah.

2918
02:34:39.42 --> 02:34:42.92
It's kind of like coaching a little bit.

2919
02:34:42.92 --> 02:34:43.92
Psychopathic coach.

2920
02:34:43.92 --> 02:34:44.92
Yeah.

2921
02:34:44.92 --> 02:34:45.92
Psychoprosha.

2922
02:34:45.92 --> 02:34:46.92
Yeah.

2923
02:34:46.92 --> 02:34:47.92
Psychoprosha.

2924
02:34:47.92 --> 02:34:48.92
Because it kind of.

2925
02:34:48.92 --> 02:34:51.92
I played one of them from my seven year old daughter the other day.

2926
02:34:51.92 --> 02:34:53.92
Because she's about to eat some candy or something.

2927
02:34:53.92 --> 02:34:54.92
I was like, come here for a minute.

2928
02:34:54.92 --> 02:34:55.92
Yeah.

2929
02:34:55.92 --> 02:34:57.92
So I played her that one, you know, the snack time one.

2930
02:34:57.92 --> 02:34:58.92
Yeah.

2931
02:34:58.92 --> 02:34:59.92
She was.

2932
02:34:59.92 --> 02:35:00.92
Yeah, sugar coated lies.

2933
02:35:00.92 --> 02:35:01.92
She was.

2934
02:35:01.92 --> 02:35:02.92
She was pretty impressed.

2935
02:35:02.92 --> 02:35:04.92
But we'll impress me as later in the evening.

2936
02:35:04.92 --> 02:35:05.92
She was kind of saying it.

2937
02:35:05.92 --> 02:35:06.92
Yeah.

2938
02:35:06.92 --> 02:35:07.92
I was.

2939
02:35:07.92 --> 02:35:07.92
See?

2940
02:35:07.92 --> 02:35:09.92
And that's what I was going to say where.

2941
02:35:09.92 --> 02:35:10.92
You explain.

2942
02:35:10.92 --> 02:35:11.92
It's like, cool.

2943
02:35:11.92 --> 02:35:12.92
It's Jockel.

2944
02:35:12.92 --> 02:35:13.92
Tell me to do this.

2945
02:35:13.92 --> 02:35:15.92
So yes, I'll do it or not do it whatever.

2946
02:35:15.92 --> 02:35:19.92
But you explain some some some good stuff like to to remember.

2947
02:35:19.92 --> 02:35:22.92
You know, like then it's sugar coated lies.

2948
02:35:22.92 --> 02:35:23.92
And that's kind of catchy too.

2949
02:35:23.92 --> 02:35:24.92
So it sticks in your mind.

2950
02:35:24.92 --> 02:35:25.92
Poison.

2951
02:35:25.92 --> 02:35:29.92
So you can buy that on iTunes.

2952
02:35:29.92 --> 02:35:30.92
Yes.

2953
02:35:30.92 --> 02:35:31.92
It's somewhere else too, right?

2954
02:35:31.92 --> 02:35:32.92
Google play.

2955
02:35:32.92 --> 02:35:33.92
If you want it.

2956
02:35:33.92 --> 02:35:36.92
And also everyone that asks for an alarm tone to wake up.

2957
02:35:36.92 --> 02:35:37.92
That's it.

2958
02:35:37.92 --> 02:35:38.92
That's it.

2959
02:35:38.92 --> 02:35:39.92
It's there now.

2960
02:35:39.92 --> 02:35:40.92
You don't have to ask anymore.

2961
02:35:40.92 --> 02:35:41.92
You can just go to iTunes and get that cycle.

2962
02:35:41.92 --> 02:35:43.92
Clear it with your wife or whoever you sleep with.

2963
02:35:43.92 --> 02:35:45.92
Yeah, we've gotten something to be going to speak back on that one.

2964
02:35:45.92 --> 02:35:46.92
Yeah.

2965
02:35:46.92 --> 02:35:50.92
Because what happens is the alarm goes off if you haven't set then it's going to be my voice.

2966
02:35:50.92 --> 02:35:54.92
And it's going to be weird because it sounds like there's some strange man in your room.

2967
02:35:54.92 --> 02:35:55.92
It's a flood there in the morning.

2968
02:35:55.92 --> 02:35:56.92
Which is kind of weird.

2969
02:35:56.92 --> 02:35:57.92
Yeah.

2970
02:35:57.92 --> 02:35:59.92
It's the only work at 430 a.m.

2971
02:35:59.92 --> 02:36:03.92
Like, no, it's just it's just it's just an album.

2972
02:36:03.92 --> 02:36:06.92
It's an album of tracks.

2973
02:36:06.92 --> 02:36:13.92
And each track talks about some moment of week generally a moment of weakness that you have.

2974
02:36:13.92 --> 02:36:15.92
Like, there's a one to wake up in the morning.

2975
02:36:15.92 --> 02:36:19.92
There's ones to you know what you don't feel like going to the gym.

2976
02:36:19.92 --> 02:36:22.92
There's ones you feel like you don't know.

2977
02:36:22.92 --> 02:36:23.92
Don't eat the donut.

2978
02:36:23.92 --> 02:36:24.92
There's one.

2979
02:36:24.92 --> 02:36:26.92
I'm going to put this off for a while.

2980
02:36:26.92 --> 02:36:27.92
I'm going to procrastinate.

2981
02:36:27.92 --> 02:36:28.92
No, you're not going to procrastinate.

2982
02:36:28.92 --> 02:36:35.92
So all the little moments of weakness that we all have as humans can be countered using psychological warfare.

2983
02:36:35.92 --> 02:36:38.92
Yeah, there's there's actually two on there.

2984
02:36:38.92 --> 02:36:40.92
There's one called like, I think it's called like no more.

2985
02:36:40.92 --> 02:36:42.92
It's basically like I'm not doing this in there.

2986
02:36:42.92 --> 02:36:43.92
Yeah, no more.

2987
02:36:43.92 --> 02:36:44.92
It's good one.

2988
02:36:44.92 --> 02:36:48.92
That one's good because it puts in towards exactly like what you want to think.

2989
02:36:48.92 --> 02:36:54.92
Like you know, because you always feel that like, you know how likely you know you're gaining some weight or I mean a lot of times you know why you're gaining weight.

2990
02:36:54.92 --> 02:36:55.92
And so it's a little bit different.

2991
02:36:55.92 --> 02:36:57.92
But you're like, you know what I'm not doing.

2992
02:36:57.92 --> 02:37:01.92
I'm drinking is one where you wake up kind of hung over and you're like, I'm not drinking anymore.

2993
02:37:01.92 --> 02:37:04.92
You know, like that thing, but you never really execute.

2994
02:37:04.92 --> 02:37:07.92
Yeah, you know, and it's perfect because it sticks with you.

2995
02:37:07.92 --> 02:37:12.92
You're like no more and then the other one was when you're talking about everyday.

2996
02:37:12.92 --> 02:37:13.92
It's called everyday.

2997
02:37:13.92 --> 02:37:14.92
Everyday.

2998
02:37:14.92 --> 02:37:16.92
Everyday is a Monday that that one.

2999
02:37:16.92 --> 02:37:18.92
Now it's dope.

3000
02:37:18.92 --> 02:37:21.92
So you can get after that also.

3001
02:37:21.92 --> 02:37:28.92
If you want to get some tea, if you're tea drink or if you're not a tea drink or you can get some chocolate, you can get it on Amazon.

3002
02:37:28.92 --> 02:37:29.92
It's fully in stock.

3003
02:37:29.92 --> 02:37:34.92
Y'all, those days of being out of stock, I think we've got them under control for now.

3004
02:37:34.92 --> 02:37:37.92
And I won't make any promises because last time I made a promise.

3005
02:37:37.92 --> 02:37:39.92
You guys went psycho.

3006
02:37:39.92 --> 02:37:42.92
So I'm not going to make a promise, but you can get the chocolate tea.

3007
02:37:42.92 --> 02:37:44.92
I figured out again, it doesn't.

3008
02:37:44.92 --> 02:37:47.92
It doesn't taste like tea.

3009
02:37:47.92 --> 02:37:49.92
Really, it doesn't taste like coffee.

3010
02:37:49.92 --> 02:37:53.92
And for a long time, I was at a loss for words to describe what it tasted like.

3011
02:37:53.92 --> 02:37:55.92
And I figured it out.

3012
02:37:55.92 --> 02:37:58.92
I was responding to someone and I figured it out what it tastes like.

3013
02:37:58.92 --> 02:38:00.92
And it's pretty simple.

3014
02:38:00.92 --> 02:38:05.92
The chocolate tea tastes like victory.

3015
02:38:05.92 --> 02:38:09.92
So if you need to.

3016
02:38:09.92 --> 02:38:10.92
And we need to trade.

3017
02:38:10.92 --> 02:38:12.92
I need to trade market.

3018
02:38:12.92 --> 02:38:13.92
What?

3019
02:38:13.92 --> 02:38:16.92
The fact that jocquoise tea tastes like victory.

3020
02:38:16.92 --> 02:38:17.92
Boom.

3021
02:38:17.92 --> 02:38:19.92
So get some of that.

3022
02:38:19.92 --> 02:38:28.92
If you need to deadlift more, if you need to overhead squat more weights, this will increase all those numbers beyond anything you could have pulled for.

3023
02:38:28.92 --> 02:38:31.92
You can drink it from a jocco mug.

3024
02:38:31.92 --> 02:38:33.92
It says get after it on it.

3025
02:38:33.92 --> 02:38:34.92
That's good.

3026
02:38:34.92 --> 02:38:35.92
Oversize, by the way.

3027
02:38:35.92 --> 02:38:36.92
Yeah, it's big.

3028
02:38:36.92 --> 02:38:37.92
It's big.

3029
02:38:37.92 --> 02:38:38.92
It's not.

3030
02:38:38.92 --> 02:38:39.92
Somebody made the comment that it's not.

3031
02:38:39.92 --> 02:38:42.92
It's not a joke.

3032
02:38:42.92 --> 02:38:43.92
Yeah, it's not like clown shoes.

3033
02:38:43.92 --> 02:38:44.92
No, it's not like clown shoes.

3034
02:38:44.92 --> 02:38:45.92
No, it's not like clown shoes.

3035
02:38:45.92 --> 02:38:46.92
It's not like clown shoes.

3036
02:38:46.92 --> 02:38:49.92
It's big enough to, you know, it's like a pair of work.

3037
02:38:49.92 --> 02:38:50.92
Boots as big as a pair of work.

3038
02:38:50.92 --> 02:38:51.92
Boots as big as a pair of work.

3039
02:38:51.92 --> 02:38:53.92
It will kick you in the ass.

3040
02:38:53.92 --> 02:38:55.92
So it's that big.

3041
02:38:55.92 --> 02:38:59.92
If you haven't got the book Extreme Ownership, you can pick that up there.

3042
02:38:59.92 --> 02:39:00.92
It's about leadership.

3043
02:39:00.92 --> 02:39:01.92
It's about combat leadership.

3044
02:39:01.92 --> 02:39:05.92
I'm going to give my friend Peter T about three copies of it.

3045
02:39:05.92 --> 02:39:06.92
Just to make sure he reads it.

3046
02:39:06.92 --> 02:39:10.92
So if he has to deal with any sea players, you're going to step up his game of a little bit.

3047
02:39:10.92 --> 02:39:11.92
Hopefully.

3048
02:39:11.92 --> 02:39:13.92
I really have a free publication.

3049
02:39:13.92 --> 02:39:14.92
That's right.

3050
02:39:14.92 --> 02:39:15.92
I really missed that.

3051
02:39:15.92 --> 02:39:19.92
We worked with a pre-pub, what does that mean before the book came out?

3052
02:39:19.92 --> 02:39:21.92
Hey, here's what the book is.

3053
02:39:21.92 --> 02:39:23.92
Okay, but it's still that's it.

3054
02:39:23.92 --> 02:39:24.92
That's it.

3055
02:39:24.92 --> 02:39:25.92
Yeah, it's not like you have the pretty stuff.

3056
02:39:25.92 --> 02:39:26.92
It's a paper bag.

3057
02:39:26.92 --> 02:39:27.92
Yeah, yeah.

3058
02:39:27.92 --> 02:39:28.92
Yeah.

3059
02:39:28.92 --> 02:39:29.92
It's a VIP.

3060
02:39:29.92 --> 02:39:30.92
Yeah.

3061
02:39:30.92 --> 02:39:31.92
Yeah.

3062
02:39:31.92 --> 02:39:34.92
Hey, speaking of Extreme Ownership, we're having another monster.

3063
02:39:34.92 --> 02:39:38.92
If you don't know what it is, check out the website, Extreme Ownership.com.

3064
02:39:38.92 --> 02:39:40.92
It's going to be a New York City.

3065
02:39:40.92 --> 02:39:45.92
So everyone can come because if you're on the East Coast, no matter where you're on the world,

3066
02:39:45.92 --> 02:39:47.92
it's easy to get to New York.

3067
02:39:47.92 --> 02:39:54.92
And May 4th and 5th, if you're a leader or you want to be a leader, come and get it.

3068
02:39:54.92 --> 02:40:00.92
There's every level of leaders there, CEOs, middle-level managers.

3069
02:40:00.92 --> 02:40:02.92
Every industry you can think of too.

3070
02:40:02.92 --> 02:40:12.92
People that manufacture and finance and construction and health and pharmaceutical, and there's police there and fire and military and oil industry and entities to everybody.

3071
02:40:12.92 --> 02:40:16.92
All working on leadership, talking about leadership.

3072
02:40:16.92 --> 02:40:19.92
So, and I've said, it's going to sell out.

3073
02:40:19.92 --> 02:40:21.92
We're moving in that direction quickly.

3074
02:40:21.92 --> 02:40:24.92
And Echo hasn't even released his videos yet because he's on Hawaii in time.

3075
02:40:24.92 --> 02:40:25.92
No, no.

3076
02:40:25.92 --> 02:40:26.92
Oh, you're not.

3077
02:40:26.92 --> 02:40:28.92
No, I'm working diligently.

3078
02:40:28.92 --> 02:40:29.92
And I'm going for quality.

3079
02:40:29.92 --> 02:40:33.92
Not, you know.

3080
02:40:33.92 --> 02:40:35.92
You're not going to put out any scrub material.

3081
02:40:35.92 --> 02:40:37.92
Right.

3082
02:40:37.92 --> 02:40:39.92
Once those videos come out, my feeling is going to sell very quickly.

3083
02:40:39.92 --> 02:40:41.92
So get there now, sign up for it.

3084
02:40:41.92 --> 02:40:47.92
If you need a police or fire discount or military discount or if you're going to be a group of people, I think the biggest group we had at the last one for one company was around 16 people.

3085
02:40:47.92 --> 02:40:49.92
From one company or 12 people.

3086
02:40:49.92 --> 02:40:52.92
But there's some pretty big numbers of companies that are showing up there.

3087
02:40:52.92 --> 02:40:54.92
Come and get it.

3088
02:40:54.92 --> 02:40:57.92
Echo, you got any closing comments.

3089
02:40:57.92 --> 02:40:59.92
My pleasure.

3090
02:40:59.92 --> 02:41:00.92
Oh, no.

3091
02:41:00.92 --> 02:41:01.92
Other closing comments.

3092
02:41:01.92 --> 02:41:02.92
Thank you.

3093
02:41:02.92 --> 02:41:03.92
Other than it was your pleasure.

3094
02:41:03.92 --> 02:41:04.92
Peter.

3095
02:41:04.92 --> 02:41:05.92
Any closing comments?

3096
02:41:05.92 --> 02:41:08.92
I would only echo Echo's comment.

3097
02:41:08.92 --> 02:41:12.92
And that didn't even get planned until it came out.

3098
02:41:12.92 --> 02:41:14.92
Perfect.

3099
02:41:14.92 --> 02:41:18.92
And if you want to continue these conversations with Peter.

3100
02:41:18.92 --> 02:41:22.92
On Twitter, your Peter T.M.D.

3101
02:41:22.92 --> 02:41:25.92
What are you on Facebook?

3102
02:41:25.92 --> 02:41:28.92
Um, I don't know.

3103
02:41:28.92 --> 02:41:30.92
Probably.

3104
02:41:30.92 --> 02:41:32.92
You still have eating academy?

3105
02:41:32.92 --> 02:41:33.92
Yeah.

3106
02:41:33.92 --> 02:41:34.92
Probably.

3107
02:41:34.92 --> 02:41:35.92
I don't do a lot.

3108
02:41:35.92 --> 02:41:37.92
So Twitter is your most Twitter's pride.

3109
02:41:37.92 --> 02:41:41.92
And I've been berated into doing something on Instagram.

3110
02:41:41.92 --> 02:41:44.92
I just can't cope at the moment.

3111
02:41:44.92 --> 02:41:45.92
Yeah.

3112
02:41:45.92 --> 02:41:47.92
There's a way to connect the two.

3113
02:41:47.92 --> 02:41:48.92
I've tried it.

3114
02:41:48.92 --> 02:41:49.92
I don't like it.

3115
02:41:49.92 --> 02:41:50.92
I do them separately.

3116
02:41:50.92 --> 02:41:51.92
Yeah.

3117
02:41:51.92 --> 02:41:53.92
You don't really connect Twitter to the Instagram.

3118
02:41:53.92 --> 02:41:54.92
Yeah.

3119
02:41:54.92 --> 02:41:55.92
I don't have any.

3120
02:41:55.92 --> 02:41:56.92
I don't have any.

3121
02:41:56.92 --> 02:41:57.92
I don't have any pictures to show.

3122
02:41:57.92 --> 02:41:58.92
Right.

3123
02:41:58.92 --> 02:41:59.92
I don't have anything to tell.

3124
02:41:59.92 --> 02:42:01.92
Don't you have a bunch of watches?

3125
02:42:01.92 --> 02:42:02.92
Yeah.

3126
02:42:02.92 --> 02:42:04.92
I'm showing the same watch every day.

3127
02:42:04.92 --> 02:42:06.92
Show that ring.

3128
02:42:06.92 --> 02:42:07.92
How you were excited?

3129
02:42:07.92 --> 02:42:08.92
I think it was all that.

3130
02:42:08.92 --> 02:42:10.92
You could do like.

3131
02:42:10.92 --> 02:42:11.92
Both pictures just on the right.

3132
02:42:11.92 --> 02:42:12.92
I don't know.

3133
02:42:12.92 --> 02:42:13.92
I don't know.

3134
02:42:13.92 --> 02:42:15.92
What if my whole Instagram stick became this?

3135
02:42:15.92 --> 02:42:17.92
Like my blood glucose.

3136
02:42:17.92 --> 02:42:18.92
Yeah.

3137
02:42:18.92 --> 02:42:19.92
That'd be pretty cool.

3138
02:42:19.92 --> 02:42:20.92
And you kind of be interested.

3139
02:42:20.92 --> 02:42:22.92
You could just, you could just, you could just,

3140
02:42:22.92 --> 02:42:25.92
save that screen and post it up there.

3141
02:42:25.92 --> 02:42:30.92
It's hard labor to save that thing and press submit to it.

3142
02:42:30.92 --> 02:42:33.92
It actually has a little switch that you can just make it go.

3143
02:42:33.92 --> 02:42:35.92
It's not that much work.

3144
02:42:35.92 --> 02:42:36.92
I don't think about it.

3145
02:42:36.92 --> 02:42:38.92

Talk about how you can see what you're going to do.

3148
02:42:40.92 --> 02:42:41.92
It's a work to post.

3149
02:42:41.92 --> 02:42:42.92
It's the grand picture.

3150
02:42:42.92 --> 02:42:43.92
You got it.

You got it.

3154
02:42:46.92 --> 02:42:47.92

02:42:47.92 --> 02:42:48.92
You got it.

3156
02:42:48.92 --> 02:42:49.92
You got it.

3157
02:42:49.92 --> 02:42:50.92
You got it.

You got it.

3163
02:42:55.92 --> 02:42:56.92
You know.

3164
02:42:56.92 --> 02:42:58.92
So if you're going to be looking around that face.

3165
02:42:58.92 --> 02:42:59.92
bulky.

3166
02:42:59.92 --> 02:43:00.92
Not easy.

3167
02:43:00.92 --> 02:43:01.92
We're going to be there.

3168
02:43:01.92 --> 02:43:06.92
Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jackson Willink and again,

3169
02:43:06.92 --> 02:43:11.92
I would like to thank you Peter for coming on and more important for everything

3170
02:43:11.92 --> 02:43:17.40
You've done for me, which really the way it's connected all together getting me through

3171
02:43:17.40 --> 02:43:23.90
to Tim Ferris, which was the book and get me on Jill Rogan, which led to this podcast.

3172
02:43:23.90 --> 02:43:31.96
It's been awesome, so to you, and to Doc Kirk Parsley, for introducing us, but thank you

3173
02:43:31.96 --> 02:43:34.24
and him for what you guys done for me.

3174
02:43:34.24 --> 02:43:40.28
So, we've met in women in uniform out there holding the line.

3175
02:43:40.28 --> 02:43:49.000
Thanks for your service and your sacrifice to the police on the corner, fighting crime, the

3176
02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:50.70
firemen, fighting fires.

3177
02:43:50.70 --> 02:43:52.28
Thanks for keeping us safe.

3178
02:43:52.28 --> 02:44:01.24
To the medical people in the medical professions, like Peter, doctors, nurses, physicians,

3179
02:44:01.24 --> 02:44:06.16
assistants, EMTs, all of you working to save lives.

3180
02:44:06.16 --> 02:44:11.48
Thank you for your commitment to service, and it's obviously a massive commitment when you hear

3181
02:44:11.48 --> 02:44:19.60
about the hours and the emotional trauma that it takes to go into any one of those

3182
02:44:19.60 --> 02:44:23.16
industries and services.

3183
02:44:23.16 --> 02:44:28.88
And to everybody else that's listening, thank you.

3184
02:44:28.88 --> 02:44:36.64
That's your communications, your questions, your participation, your feedback and your

3185
02:44:36.64 --> 02:44:44.40
spreading of the word that makes this possible, and it's what makes this worthwhile.

3186
02:44:44.40 --> 02:44:50.48
So thank all of you for all of that.

3187
02:44:50.48 --> 02:44:59.000
And finally, thanks to all of you for getting out there and getting after it.
