Cohen told reporters that after rigorous review of thousands of pages of documents statements and after acting reports the military ordinance and weapon storage records quote we found no evidence to support CNN time assertions we have found absolutely no evidence to support these charges CNN and time retracted their reports noting that they could not support either charge on July 2nd 1998 in a CNN retraction CNN news group chairman president CEO Tom Johnson said an independent investigation concluded that the report quote cannot be supported there was insufficient evidence that serenor any other deadly gas was used and CNN could not confirm that American defectors were targeted at the camp as news stand reported we apologize to our viewers and to our colleagues at time for this mistake CNN owes a special apology to the personnel involved in operation tailwind both soldiers on the ground and the US Air Force pilots and US Marine Corps helicopter pilots who were involved in the action on July 13th time magazine printed in apologies to its readers had vined tailwind and apology they noted that the allegations reported on June 7th and 8th 1998 could not quote be supported by the evidence and quote in July 14th 1998 Ted Turner wrote a letter to Macartley quote I hope you accept my personal apology for the CNN newsstands recent erroneous reporting on operation tailwind this entire episode has been very painful for me as the founder of CNN however my greatest distress comes from knowing that our coverage upset those on the front line of operation tailwind the soldiers on the ground and the US Air Force and Marine Corps pilots engaged in the action and quote Macartley said in a 2015 interview quote I personally spoke to Ted Turner and he reiterated that he wrote what he wrote in the letter he also told me he was going to call the other members of our team and write them a letters of apology to my best to the best of my knowledge that did not happen and quote Larry grow a marine core helicopter door gunner who survived the operation tailwind added I felt really betrayed by CNN for allowing those reporters to publish all those lies and twisting the statements from those who were interviewed CNN showed me how the news media can twist a story to fit its needs and have never really trusted any of the other media 100% in their reporting since then. and I'm gonna go to the book 28 years after one of the most successful operations run in the 1970 run in 1970 during the eight-year secret war operation tailwind CNN that's the cable new news network broadcast a disgraceful erroneous story that stained the reputation of the men who participated in that mission portraying them as war criminals and set a reporting the facts of the successful mission CNN accused the green berets and airmen of gassing American POWs held captive in louss with deadly seren gas CNN used that air laden net work work a fiction in an effort to compete with CBS's popular 60-minute program when it launched a new program on June 7 1998 called new stand the title of the bogus slanderist story entitled Valley of Death it alleged that 16 green berets and 120-indiged troops from operation tailwind had destroyed a village and killed innocent women and children while directing US aircraft the drop lethal seren nerve gas on US war defectors they said were POWs of the communist to compound the egregious attack against America's finest soldiers in airmen the next day time magazine repeated the hideous allegations in the news story written by CNN staff members headline did the US drop nerve gas it was written by CNN producer all April Oliver and CNN international correspondent Peter Arneut who produced the CNN story that aired June 7th the broadcast and time article smeared the men of operation tailwind which was conducted during the eight-year secret war in louss during the Vietnam War and run under the ages of military assistance command Vietnam studies an operation group or simply sog there was an additional political ramification stemming from the CNN time magazine report in 1998 at a July 21st 1998 press conference repudiating the CNN time report then secretary defense William Cohen said quote the charge would be used to discredit the united states attempt to curb the proliferation periffelation of weapons of mass destruction in fact Iraq immediately incorporated CNN's charges into its anti-use anti-US propaganda effort to try and deflect attention from its own outlawed chemical and biological weapons programs end quote. but no the pumpkin spice so that's the thing where it's almost like part of the reason or part of the whole teasing culture of it for lack of a better way of putting it um was that everyone likes pumpkin spice but you know like it's like if you're like tough you don't want to like admit it like everyone it pumps the spice freaking delicious in your cafe latte or whatever like whatever it's always still everyone knows that you know that's like kind of the thing that's why I'm I'm going to be on some a little bit excited for pumpkin spice first smashing pumpkin we're not doing pumpkin spice we're doing smashing pumpkin because I'm starting to see the connection here that you're making I think I like it and yeah guess what guess what if you want a little visual representation they kind of keep you on track check out flipside canvas dot com and get something to hang on your wall graphic representation of the path also got some books obviously these books here by john striker mart across

front of my computer answering questions go to ef online dot com coming hang out basically coming hang out we have something called the muster where you come and physically hang out and learn about leadership we've had to cancel a few of them because of the covid virus it's gratifying beyond words Scarface pilot Barry Pensick am I saying that right just handshake Pensick Pensick Scarface pilot Barry Pensick told the audience that when the Marines went across the fence into louse quote they made us change our call sign for some reason they called them mission 72 when we went across the fence whenever we ran a mission 72 for some reason they had us take off our dog tags leave our wall at home so you couldn't be identified as if you go down in an American made helicopter and you're a white brown-go-right guy round eye in an Asian country and no one's gonna know you're American I never understood the logic of that then in a closing note Pensick turned to the audience and apologized to the ladies and advanced for contaminating the spoken word with profanities to summarize the time he spent during that operation I can't think of another way to say this he said apologetically for example if someone is really good he's a hot shit if something was good it was shit hot if you get into a bad situation it was a shit sandwich Don Persky mentioned the same which we got into earlier if you had your act together you had your shit together so that's the White House for President Trump and it shows you that you know even though it wasn't known about at the time the heroism of these guys was just well that's the highest honor that that that that person can be can receive so salute to those guys and and man what a mission now I'm going to jump ahead and look we're we're not covering all of soccer on the circles by the way that was one mission to cover in this volume one of song chronicles um but one of the things that when I started reading I read a quote that said you know as of June 13 2017 there were still 50 green berets listed as MIA in Lousalone along with at least 105 aviators who died supporting song missions they are among the total of approximately 260 aviators mission missing in Lousalone as of this printing now there's a there's a story in here and I don't want to go through the whole thing um because people should get the book and read through it hey we're gonna be all seen and then tonight and then halfway through the broadcast when that true tone comes out and the founder of the cell like your work criminals and and then Mike had to explain to his daughter Mike Rose and he was just devastated and he had to sit there and try to explain to you and these kids see things on TV TV's never wrong and look at dad with a little bit of cross-eyed but horribly impact on a personal level nobody ever hears about you alluded to this earlier because of the secrecy of sock and what you guys were doing there's a bunch of reasons because the secrecy of sock because the number of guys that were doing turnover so you got guys coming in and leaving and then the number guys that are wounded the number of guys that are killed the number guys that are missing there's a lot of sock operators that as as we mentioned earlier never met the pilots that were supporting them so what we're doing uh subscribe to this podcast check out some of the other podcasts that we have jockel unraveling which used to be called the thread but we change the name so jockel unraveling soon to be on its own feed we have grounded which we really haven't recorded in a long time we need to get that done and warrior kid also not recording a long time but you can listen to those podcasts you can subscribe to those podcasts and this one and we also have a youtube channel I think the main value of the youtube channel and this is maybe kind of serious is for those of us who like to watch the podcast two reasons want to watch the podcast as it goes on like if you have a flat screen or you know these one of these smart TVs in your office or your gym or whatever you want to play it for me on some visual what do you call it like association you can get a job start tomorrow looks like sure It's like you're in a jungle like you've heard it before you don't know what the hell bad the weather is of your on the ground and you can't tell about times the difference between sun and the no sun that's just dark in the jungle and they break loose every once the while I get to open if they could see right Jean had no idea that's when Covey told because I interviewed Jean on and he was like stunned when they when the Covey told like he really thought we're going to kick Darius we just hit the cash you say cash or cash you're the English major I'm only English minor so he's on conscious helicopter continues up gets hammered turns around spins out of control and then crashed into a granite wall or to a mountain killing the entire air crew everybody on the ropes so the next day uh the bright light goes in and um maybe in the day or two days later the bright light goes in they get to the crash site and they're able to recover all the bodies Sammy Hernandez during the night woke up played hiding go seek with the NVA found a uh found a cave or some kind of area where you get out away and before we went into the cave he his shoulder was dislocated so he pounded his shoulder back into place on a tree then he hid for the night in the morning it first light a cubby came by and he had his panel and they were able to strapped him out they came in with the bright light got all the bodies put him into body bags moving to a location I forgive they got to the top of the mountain or not but Cliff Newman was on that mission and um they went in put together of you all the bodies but then and you again you alluded this to this earlier in 2016 go into the book the first operation tailwind reunion was held at the Tennessee Museum of Aviation bringing together for the first time in more than 45 years some of the men from all of the aviation units and some of the special forces soldiers from that unique mission featuring B company commander Jean McCartley the commanding officer of the A1 skyrators Mel Swanson and the pilots who flew Marine Corps cobre gunships from Scarface the CH53 pilots and a few forward air controllers with tears in his eyes Swanson said I hope this is the first of more reunions like it to see how grateful the men of sock were for our support during those hairy pre-refire missions touches me through and through as well as the other pilots here today we always wondered who those crazy fuckers on the ground were and now thanks to the reunions and this reunion we get to meet them Interviewed in 2016 retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Mel Swanson who is the commanding officer of the daring A1 Skyrader pilots remain brutally bitter about CNN's false story quote Operation Tailwind was the classic example of inter-service cooperation in that area of operations think about it America's finest the green berets and their loyal troops kicked ass and took numbers on the ground deep in enemy territory the tactical air support from the Air Force fast movers C130 gunships are beloved age A1 H spads in combination with Marine Corps Scarface Cobre gunships army army cobras and Marine Corps dimmers raised hell in the enemies backyard we killed hundreds of these comic bastards and thanks to that green beret medic all were kept alive until the final extraction when one montnard soldier was killed until 1998 I occasionally watched the communist news network but after they ruined our reputations I never watched again it was a crime against our warriors what they did it was a travesty of justice. yeah by the way we already lost one of these things McCarley moved down a road towards a clearing that was large enough for Nell Z however the open area was seated too deeply in a valley which had hills on two sides of it where the NVA gunners would be able to have clear fields of fire on the marine rescue helicopters as well as the supporting tack air assets Scarface cobre gunships to facilitate the continued movement of B company A1 spads and cobre Scarface Scarface cobre's quote gave us fire protection to the front and to the rear McCarley said the NVA kept hitting us with automatic fire and B40s the air strikes kept them back far enough so they couldn't do any real damage at some point Kaviran dangerously low on fuel returned to base and connected spad pilot Tom Stump directly with McCarley about future air strikes shortly before the first CH 53 arrived in the area of operations. and so you know you get a situation like this these guys and you know you know it's thinking about you know Mike Rose who who had to make that decision out in the jungle that he's gonna leave you know his his his in-ditch troops out there that were dead he's leaving the bodies but you know I like to do things that are beneficial to the world you know I don't want to just consume right well guess what good origin main you get some of that gear you are contributing to the world you are bringing the manufacturing back to America got a bunch of hard working American people up there making it happen and when you support the cause you are doing good for humanity that might seem like a big step it's true Macarly said, so these guys have the goal like okay we got we got some wounded guys we need to get these guys out of here they fight to get it get an LZ once they get this LZ established under attack they push the attack back and then the weather rolls in and the guys can't guys can't fly. Cohen ordered a full scale across the board investigation of the CNN time story from all military branches involved in operation tailwind while requesting at the same time from the CIA and the joint chiefs of staffs of course these guys found up you know reported what had really happened and then there's some retractions and some apologies secretary Cohen said I think all Americans should know that the 16 men who conducted this mission were heroes but that that they had been have been hurt by this report I can assure you that you and your colleagues and your families you did nothing wrong and he's obviously he's addressing the the men. so these guys are in a bad way and and now McCarley kind of realizes we got the enemy coming we got weather moving in back to the book realizing they needed a large LZ a large LZ large enough to handle a CH 53 because CH 53's are massive birds in the light of and and by the way there's no opportunity you're not going to get 50 guys out on strings so this thing's going to have to land right like I said I said it before I say it again it's like you know when you're in the airplane and oxygen mask comes down what are they instructed you to do put on yourself then you help your small infant child whatever the case so kind of the same situation all right so we're working out we're keeping ourselves on the path on the path isn't just such some so-tark thing by the way it's keeping your shit together thanks man like a bad dream we'll be back and with that tilt has left the building unbelievable opportunity to sit here and talk to these guys and learn these stories so many stories you know after we after we turned off the mics I started getting kind of crazy talking to tilt I was saying hey when you're talking about 600 hand grenades getting thrown each one of those hand grenades that gets thrown by the enemy into your position is a whole story there's a whole story behind it Yeah the the seals had a relationship like like that with the with the sea wolves the the nature of the copper pilots and we've had a couple sea wolves on here and a legend freaking badass same thing same they were going like if they got the call they were going that's all there was to it scrambled the sea wolves but we have one coming in Dallas Texas December 3rd and 4th go to extreme ownership dot com if you want to come to that we have ef overwatch where we take people from the military that have the understanding of the principles that we talk about and we place those people into the civilian sector into companies in the leadership position go to ef overwatch dot com if you're a company that needs leaders we have america's mighty warriors dot org mommily mark least mom her mission since she lost mark since we lost mark has been to help service members around the world in all kinds of different aspects if you want to get on board you want to help out go to america's mighty warriors dot org and you can donate or you can get involved and if you want to hear more from us you can contact us if you have questions if you have answers if you can fill in the blanks of some of the blanks that we get to you can find us on the interwebs for till pro john striker mire he's on twitter at sag john instagram is at j strike or mire and facebook is at john striker mire on the interwebs he's got sag chronicles dot com And then you have Abrams, who's not a fan of special forces, which I believe we've done a good job of moving this in a better direction, but there certainly has been tension from time to time between conventional forces and special forces and special operations, guys, generally because special operations, guys, well, they don't follow the same rules all the time that the conventional guys follow. but it was too dark they couldn't come in and get him out that night the plan was in the morning they'll come in early well in the morning before any aircraft could get there any aircraft cover the NVA hit that team hard and bottle line they couldn't get the body sound they'd literally left them there um 35 40 years later Cliff Newman goes back in an effort to work with our uh what's now DPA department PLAW MIA County HC and it was the predecessor but Cliff went in try to find it they cooperation with the uh in business people uh forgive with the lay oceans or the Vietnamese they put them in too far away from the mountain they so Cliff went back four or five years ago again the second time and again there are two far away so Cliff is waiting for the third call to go back and uh try to help him and this is the dedication of Cliff and uh Sammy Hernandez is still alive and of course Cliff Newman was uh and Sammy we're on the first team that did the first Halo jump in the layhouse
