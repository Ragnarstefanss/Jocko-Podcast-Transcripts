and we've actually I got people now that have started jiu jitsu because the podcast and they say oh I just did my first jiu jitsu class damn that was humbling it is extremely humbling you're gonna get be you're never gonna know everything you're always gonna be learning that there's other ways to do things and somebody that just started can come up with amazing techniques and that's humbling and there's other martial arts that have better moves that you need to pay attention to like wrestling has better take downs like sombo with the leg locks and catch wrestling some of those things that are better moves and you need to apply those and guess what you still need to know how to strike because it can be hard to take people down so you know how to how to strike and you can't be cocky and you can't be over confident because the bottom line is in jiu jitsu you will get beat and you will get beat by smaller guys by weaker guys by older guys you're gonna get beat and there's somebody that's better than you and if you don't like that or if your ego doesn't like that then you gotta find a new game to play yeah I feel like like just like how you were saying like we a lot of this we already knew we already know about state discipline we already know about all this stuff or whatever but coming from you it helps and then on top of that I'm really starting to really understand and feel is that you know all like you on Twitter like you engage you know you like someone asks your questions it seems like you're engaging a lot more so than if somebody asks me question I'm going to answer their question so if you add in that's what I like about you it kind of individualizes that person like I'm the guy who does that you know that good part so it gives them that confidence so it's kind of like yeah tell me more kind of attitude and then at the end doing like something along the lines of like yeah good thanks you know thanks for the time or whatever and then be like I got your back and I'll just go with one move for a long period of time you got to be careful that I need to be better about that discipline equals freedom so with you jitsu the more disciplined you are in training the more freedom you have on the mat so the more you train the more you work the more you drill the more you can move the more you can escape the more you can create the more you can finish you and not to mention the fear that it eliminates because like you know I'll like let's say you're not that discipline you take two weeks off a lot of time when you come back from that two weeks like you have that added element of nervousness like dang am I gonna gas or am I gonna get you know tapped out in front of everybody when you know when you know maybe there's a higher expectation on me or something like that this real matter fact but fun funny like kind of person whatever like but when I say matter fact I mean like um like that one this one tournament when uh it was kind of later where I lost two genre Roberts and you got me with a go-go plata and you know when you lose in jujitsu training and that was the first time I lost in since I went advance you know because those doing a lot of no-gui I had never lost and genre Roberts gets me with a go-go plata so instead of you saying hey you know it's okay here nothing like that you send me a text you're sitting across the arena you're right there you send me a text and it like almost like if I want to say something to to indicate that I'm going to blame someone or something it's almost like a red flag like I'm not allowed to do that in my own mind it's like it's hard in fast rule and like I said they just stand out like a sore thumb everywhere though on TV you know the guy not even my conversation you know so when I approach things like that now and also I think of all the good things that have been done like great things and just good things whatever if these people didn't do it because they didn't feel like it like these things when they got done you know I I say it all the time there's nothing new here and we're not given out any ground breaking techniques and there's no miracle drug and there's no three-minute exercise that's going to change your life I'm not selling the self-help reach your potential through this magical mystery I'm telling people what they already know and we're talking about things that people know to be right in their own heads like discipline and hard work and consistency those are the things and we all know those things but to everybody that's that's kind of known these things for a while but they've recently started to get after it good on you but first of all you know I thank people who spread the words and it's really good to hear that feedback it fires me up to hear the feedback and when people say I motivate them I'm always like you motivate me you know that motivates me that you're out there getting up at 5 a.m. and turning your life around I think that's awesome and also what I what I liked about this was they pointed out that this isn't just military or police or jiu jitsu players it's for pretty much anybody in any station in life and any job any age man or woman any country and as a matter of fact I was in England and my wife from England and when I was in England I went and saw one of my wife's friends who I'm friends with the husband and you know here's this woman who's I don't know 40 something years old right you gotta know when to tap you gotta know when to give up on a single battle so that you don't lose the whole war gotta train for worst case scenarios you gotta start with that person on your back gotta start with the person with you in an arm lock and training for combat you gotta train for those worst case scenarios where you're outnumbered you got a bunker position but you could still always tell that there are something behind the scenes you know you know Darrogens said like he's seeing you and he was like there's I don't know this guy you know it's kind of got that same feeling I have way more than me but kind of as a result of everything I feel like we're all kind of doing this together you know you know how the guys done in Australia they'll post all that you know a lot of people everyone they're posting there you know 430 a.m. wake up time to do this everyone yeah and then um yeah well funny is that you never came off like once like like new you like immediately you never came off as this super intense person like it was more like you were just sarcastic I tell how it is and if you don't like you kind of think and all right go ahead and do that but see how that works out for you know see how many people follow you see many people want to listen to you many people want to be around you even you know I like the indirect approach to next question joko what is the number one philosophical lesson that you've learned from jiu jitsu I don't really watch that much TV but those do that's maybe you know two hours or so that I could be reading something that's gonna help me through the rest of my life or getting better at something that's gonna help my you know relationships or career or something like that and I use that example because that seems pretty pretty like not in consequence because it's only two shows it's not like I spent 10 hours a day watching TV but if you're not ready to accept them you just won't accept them or they'll just go in one year and out the other and a lot of time that has to do with who's saying it so if like I don't know your neighbor some goof off he's drinking a beer smoking a cigarette he's like hey guess what you know you should do this and it's that it can be this great advice being like I'm not going to listen to you I'm not even a listen to you and it's there for a reason survival mechanism and all these ways but it's all that exists for an you know an environment that's not current so if you can basically be aware of that and combat that where don't do the immediate payoff things so just take take what you're about to do evaluated is this going to help me other than the pleasure that I think well whether that in regards to food drinking TV shows like if you watch reality TV check yourself on now and ask yourself is this going to help me in the future and typically that that answer for those types of things you're going to be know and then consider in alternative that you can do and a lot of the stuff can be pleasurable that will help you in the future and it's totally up to you it's totally up to you why not make the good choice right so the not feeling like it is no excuse that idea came in and so now like it morphed into this thing like me not feeling like it who guess what I'm going to do I'm going to do it so I've always been into working out and so me not feeling like working out is I've always felt like working out so as far as not feeling like it that wasn't really a factor but in a bunch of other things in life it was a factor and so so you're saying we're not feeling like doing this and why you're seeing yeah but you gotta be ready to adapt you gotta constantly improve your position you gotta have fun while you're doing it you gotta practice being in bad situations you gotta make your training is realistic as possible right these are all things I talk about these in all aspects of combat and in business and in life you gotta be physically fit to your mind stay sharp that's true true in jiu jitsu yeah it's say when it comes to listening to you this podcast all the you know the answers you have for these questions and any questions I even have it seems like it it comes and a process it way more readily than you know memes on Facebook or wherever you know say that that's awesome pretty true that's that's really cool that's that's great to hear and I've I mean I've definitely seen a transition in everything you're doing I mean everything you're doing is spot on otherwise I'm gonna leave myself a little bit of an out I'm not gonna just dig in on things that I can't be positive about because why would I why would I do that now when I end up being wrong if I do take a stance on something it's no big deal I'm gonna use that as an opportunity to show that I'm humble and show that I can admit when I'm wrong I'm gonna take advantage of a good I'm wrong good and you know so I would say just keep your options open keep an open mind when you feel yourself or your ego is digging in just check yourself and admit that you're wrong and move on and one thing I think that happens with people is people think that digging in and having a strong 100% opinion makes them a pure stronger or it makes their idea pure stronger and and which means I don't dig in on a lot because I'm not a 100% sure of much right who can be a 100% sure of a lot of things and when I do do that it's not that hard for me to realize that I'm wrong stifle my ego admit it in change course it's not that big of a deal to me when I like I said when I do dig in on a subject or on a decision it's because I know like almost to a 100% certainty that I'm right and I think that's all I've got for the night so thanks all you troopers out there tuning in and listening and thanks for remembering you know we started this off tonight with the statement of remembrance of some fallen warriors so thanks for remembering them remembering the past remembering war and the horror and the glory and the heroes thanks for remembering that and thanks for learning from them thanks for connecting with us through the interwebs you guys out there are opening my mind with the books that you're sending me the articles that you're sending me the videos you're sending me the connections you're making you're making us smarter so thank you and of course thanks for supporting the podcast listening downloading subscribing reviewing right reviews get on iTunes and write some reviews if you want if you feel like it so it's like it's like your whole way of life in that regard is just shifted extreme ownership and the awareness of that seeing it and other people or lack of it and other people definitely stands out like crazy once you start thinking about it oh because one of the things I say to people is I'm not you know because I can tap you but doesn't mean that I'm a better human than you just means I train more jiu jitsu than you this you know what I mean that's all it means and that means that someone else has trained in jiu jiu more than me and they can beat me and that's just what it is but sometimes people think that because they can tap somebody out that they're better than them and you kind of you were just more like this stoic guy basically I would imagine the same guy that people interpret you to be from the outside you know kind of like not intense but just real but now everyone's all all be challenging myself to do as many things as I can and be like solid and on top of that and you're the one who said this was one time one of the things you were kind of tired and you were like you know you know like I hope he corrects me more I hope he tells me how to do this because he obviously just like I was saying you know you could be a top performer here that's awesome to see yeah and another thing that kind of I came to as not a conclusion but it which is a result it's not a direct like you didn't tell me this but this is what all my existing thoughts mixed with all your input kind of arrived at one of the things is that it's up to you it's up to me what I spend my time doing totally up to me and it's up to me what I feel my head with so you know like well you know like any other like any other of my friends Yeah, and just like how you're saying where it may seem like people don't understand and that's okay because they don't, that's so true because in this way, I think of it because my best friends are actually they're still in, maybe seals. yeah you know those guys weigh 150 pounds and you know a surfer guy and a whatever Jeff is I don't know what genre of human you put Jeff into but you wouldn't think that he would throw a dars choke on your face well yesterday you said this and yesterday you said that and so in her mind I was talking to her yesterday I was talking to her yesterday and that's when I kind of realized that how how impactful is what we talked about where you know where the words the podcast words are going directly into your brain and I've had a bunch of people say you know and Greg took me like I was a white belt again immediately the kind where he literally nothing I did work and everything he did work there's like it's like he did a step one step two step three tap me out step one step two set And you know, maybe, you know, in this case, he could have given some pushback and said, hey, you know what, boss here's what's going on. then later on you know I text him what are the hey thanks for going over this with me just like Cabrol you don't keep it up and you can be like a world champion you just say that and I screened grab my phone every morning as the alarm goes off and post that shot with another shot from my walk a few minutes in I walk for an hour daily and it started stretching daily for an hour but this doesn't stop there I now have a bunch of friends who are getting up early and going for a walk or going to the gym getting after it as you say we are all noticing an improvement in our lives so we might not be military or police we are not planning on becoming jiu jitsu champions at this stage we're just people who lost themselves lost their way who are finding their way back in part thanks to you I credit you at least twice a week and tell people to find you on Twitter I had to write here because there's no way I could fit this into 140 characters and thanks to Tim and Joe for having you on their shows that's where I found you have a great day I hear from a lot of veterans and I just want to let those guys know, you know, kind of where I'm coming from, get a lot of real positive stuff from guys and let some guys go with you hard times gotta keep things simple you got to create you got to have an open mind you got to be creative and look for different ways to win and different things to do you got to make sure you don't get trapped in your ruts mentally trapped in a rut this happens to me but you gotta make that attitude part of your everyday life the extra rep the extra mile the extra round the right choices to make yourself stronger mentally and physically stand and fight fight against weakness and against fear their fight against time and decay fight back go down swing it give every day everything you've got and when you face a challenge even something where you don't believe you can win maybe to situation where you cannot win but if you can't win remember this you have nothing to lose so stand up and go forward and go out in a blaze of glory fighting with everything you've got every ounce of energy every beat is sweat and every drop of blood to your last breath and then and only then you can stand down and you can put down your sword and you can put down your shield and rest in peace indirect people be indirect it's harder it's challenging it takes more time it takes more patience and it is way more effective in fact and we talked about how before like some people they'll be like and it's of course this philosophical this philosophy is something that I definitely carried over to combat and carry over to when I talk to businesses and carry over to life you can't be over confident you can't be over confident you're never gonna think you know everything you have to respect the enemy that's part of humility you got to respect your if you're not humble you don't respect your enemy you don't respect your opponent you don't respect your competitor and if you don't that's when you're gonna get caught so to me humility is the most important thing that jiu jitsu teaches you but I didn't know you didn't talk to you nothing like that I just had heard of you from Dean and then in like 06 when we moved over to the boxing club I rolled with you one time I was still a white belt oh definitely block you because it's like why would I why would I start learning all this weirdo game like if you're strong wrestler like why would I start learning bottom game but it's it's very prevalent is when people blame when I see people blaming other people or blaming me or I feel the compulsion to blame someone else it stands out like a sore thumb almost like if if I've been feeling that and here's thing a lot of people that's how you know it in fact a little bit of that is good because you get a confidence that hunger to even learn more and be better so I had that and then Greg and rolled with Greg since I did know him as good Once you've got multiple covering move situations going on right now, and again to the military folks that are listening this, you could breeze through this description and miss how important that is, how important and what a great example of covering move this is, got to put down that cover fire, you got to put down that cover fire and that's why you got to bring them heavy weapons out there, bring those AWs out boys.
