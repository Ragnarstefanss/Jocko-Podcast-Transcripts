00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.44
This is Jocco podcast number 130.

2
00:00:03.44 --> 00:00:06.24
With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

3
00:00:06.24 --> 00:00:08.56
Good evening, echo. Good evening.

4
00:00:08.56 --> 00:00:16.60
Caesar, when he perceived that the seventh legion which stood close by him was also hard

5
00:00:16.60 --> 00:00:22.08
pressed by the enemy, directed the tribunes of the soldiers to affect a junction of the legions

6
00:00:22.08 --> 00:00:27.98
gradually and make their charge upon the enemy with a double front, which having been

7
00:00:27.98 --> 00:00:34.54
done since they brought assistance to the one to the other, nor feared less, their rear

8
00:00:34.54 --> 00:00:37.02
should be surrounded by the enemy.

9
00:00:37.02 --> 00:00:43.86
They began to stand their ground more boldly and to fight more courageously.

10
00:00:43.86 --> 00:00:49.78
In the meantime, the soldiers of the two legions which had been in the rear of the army as

11
00:00:49.78 --> 00:00:55.58
a guard for the baggage train upon the battle being reported to them, quickened their

12
00:00:55.58 --> 00:00:59.90
pace and were seen by the enemy on top of the hill.

13
00:00:59.90 --> 00:01:05.78
And Titus having gained possession of the camp of the enemy and observed from higher ground

14
00:01:05.78 --> 00:01:13.10
what was going on in our camp sent the tenth legion as a relief to our men who, when they

15
00:01:13.10 --> 00:01:18.94
had learned from the flight of the horses and the settlers in what position the affair

16
00:01:18.94 --> 00:01:25.70
was and in how great danger the camp and the Legion and the commander were involved left

17
00:01:25.70 --> 00:01:30.66
undone nothing to dispatch.

18
00:01:30.66 --> 00:01:38.30
By their arrival, so great a change of matters was made that are men, even those who had fallen

19
00:01:38.30 --> 00:01:46.30
down exhausted with wounds, leaned on their shields and renewed the fight.

20
00:01:46.30 --> 00:01:52.94
And the camp retainers, though unarmed, seeing the enemy completely dismayed, attacked

21
00:01:52.94 --> 00:01:56.14
them, though they were armed.

22
00:01:56.14 --> 00:02:03.38
The horsemen too, that they might, by their valor, blot the disgrace of their flight, thrust

23
00:02:03.38 --> 00:02:10.86
themselves before the Legionary soldiers in all parts of the battle.

24
00:02:10.86 --> 00:02:18.78
And the enemy, even in the last hope of safety, displayed such great courage that when

25
00:02:18.78 --> 00:02:26.90
the foremost of them had fallen, the next stood upon those who were prostrate and fought

26
00:02:26.90 --> 00:02:30.86
from on top of their bodies.

27
00:02:30.86 --> 00:02:37.02
When these were overthrown and their corpses heaped up together, those who survived cast

28
00:02:37.02 --> 00:02:43.26
their weapons against our men as from a mound and returned our darts which had fallen

29
00:02:43.26 --> 00:02:48.78
short between our armies so that it ought not to be concluded.

30
00:02:48.78 --> 00:02:56.26
That men of such great courage had indiddishously dared to pass a very broad river,

31
00:02:56.26 --> 00:03:02.66
a send very high banks and come to a very disinventageous place since their greatness

32
00:03:02.66 --> 00:03:19.74
of spirit had rendered these actions easy, although in themselves very difficult.

33
00:03:19.74 --> 00:03:35.34
So war is eternal and some things do not change and in war we see the brutal examples of

34
00:03:35.34 --> 00:03:46.26
savagery and we also see the courage and sacrifice that's hard to find anywhere else,

35
00:03:46.26 --> 00:03:51.54
like in that passage right there unarmed men attacking the enemy.

36
00:03:51.54 --> 00:03:58.42
And even the enemy showing courage, climbing on top of stacked bodies of their brethren

37
00:03:58.42 --> 00:04:04.78
to gain a little bit of high ground.

38
00:04:04.78 --> 00:04:14.34
Think about that gaining the high ground by climbing on the backs of your fallen comrades.

39
00:04:14.34 --> 00:04:24.62
Now that is war and that account of war is from the book The Gallic Wars which was written

40
00:04:24.62 --> 00:04:31.46
by Julius Caesar himself, although he refers to himself in the third person.

41
00:04:31.46 --> 00:04:40.58
And that war lasted from around 58 BC to 50 BC, 8 years of fighting between the Gauls

42
00:04:40.58 --> 00:04:49.10
who were a Celtic race of people in what is now France and Belgium, I guess you'd say

43
00:04:49.10 --> 00:04:52.38
Celtic.

44
00:04:52.38 --> 00:04:59.10
And of course the Romans were known for their military strength and in the future I'm

45
00:04:59.10 --> 00:05:06.02
sure we'll go a little bit deeper into some of Caesar's writing.

46
00:05:06.02 --> 00:05:14.18
Today we're going to look more at an overall assessment and instruction really about the

47
00:05:14.18 --> 00:05:23.02
Roman legions which as I said our known as an incredibly powerful military fighting force

48
00:05:23.02 --> 00:05:31.66
that conquered much of Europe and parts of Africa and the Middle East over time.

49
00:05:31.66 --> 00:05:42.94
And the writing that we're looking at today comes from a guy by the name of the Gettius.

50
00:05:42.94 --> 00:05:52.94
Now his full name was Publius, Flavius, Vigettius, Renoptus.

51
00:05:52.94 --> 00:05:59.90
But thankfully we can just refer to him as the Gettius, not much is known about him.

52
00:05:59.90 --> 00:06:07.42
It's actually not even known 100% if a Gettius was actually in the military.

53
00:06:07.42 --> 00:06:12.98
It seems as if he was and even if he was, it's likely that he didn't have any great

54
00:06:12.98 --> 00:06:17.86
stature or rank inside the Roman military.

55
00:06:17.86 --> 00:06:27.90
But he did capture some incredibly important information and he called the Epidimal

56
00:06:27.90 --> 00:06:34.94
Ray Militarus which translates basically into the Epidimal of the Art of War.

57
00:06:34.94 --> 00:06:43.34
Sometimes it's also called the day Ray Militaria which means on matters of the military.

58
00:06:43.34 --> 00:06:49.42
And the book is estimated to have been written around 430 AD so it's several hundred years

59
00:06:49.42 --> 00:06:52.78
after Caesar's reign.

60
00:06:52.78 --> 00:07:00.82
This book that hero became a guide for warfare throughout the Middle Ages.

61
00:07:00.82 --> 00:07:05.54
And interestingly this is even it stayed even after we had gunpowder.

62
00:07:05.54 --> 00:07:11.66
And it was carried often times by general officers and their staff throughout Europe

63
00:07:11.66 --> 00:07:18.26
and there are even reports that George Washington carried an annotated copy with him

64
00:07:18.26 --> 00:07:23.62
which as I dug into it may or may not be completely true but Adam Minimum.

65
00:07:23.62 --> 00:07:33.30
Adam Minimum, he paraphrased Vigettius's book in his first addressed to Congress in 1790

66
00:07:33.30 --> 00:07:43.58
when he said to be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.

67
00:07:43.58 --> 00:07:51.82
So Vigettius put this information together through Adam Minimum keen observation of how

68
00:07:51.82 --> 00:07:57.02
the Roman legions and the Roman military worked.

69
00:07:57.02 --> 00:08:02.02
And the book is to the test of time so I think we might as well see what we can get out

70
00:08:02.02 --> 00:08:03.02
of it.

71
00:08:03.02 --> 00:08:05.02
What do you think?

72
00:08:05.02 --> 00:08:06.02
Yes sir.

73
00:08:06.02 --> 00:08:07.02
A gree.

74
00:08:07.02 --> 00:08:08.42
Check.

75
00:08:08.42 --> 00:08:10.42
It starts off strong.

76
00:08:10.42 --> 00:08:12.42
We'll say that.

77
00:08:12.42 --> 00:08:16.54
It starts off right here.

78
00:08:16.54 --> 00:08:24.86
Victory in war does not depend entirely upon numbers or mere courage, only skill and discipline

79
00:08:24.86 --> 00:08:27.54
will ensure it.

80
00:08:27.54 --> 00:08:31.46
It's common theme.

81
00:08:31.46 --> 00:08:36.62
We find that the Romans owed the conquest of the world to no other cause than their

82
00:08:36.62 --> 00:08:43.50
continual military training, exact observance of discipline in their camps and unwearied

83
00:08:43.50 --> 00:08:50.06
cultivation of other arts of war.

84
00:08:50.06 --> 00:08:54.02
Does this mean I'm just going to be talking about discipline for the next as long as I'm alive?

85
00:08:54.02 --> 00:08:55.02
Yes.

86
00:08:55.02 --> 00:09:00.06
It's entirely possible, isn't it?

87
00:09:00.06 --> 00:09:03.74
It's interesting that he says it's important than just mere, more important than just

88
00:09:03.74 --> 00:09:04.74
mere courage.

89
00:09:04.74 --> 00:09:08.82
It encourages important, but there's something more important discipline.

90
00:09:08.82 --> 00:09:09.82
Yes.

91
00:09:09.82 --> 00:09:10.82
That's skill.

92
00:09:10.82 --> 00:09:11.82
And skill.

93
00:09:11.82 --> 00:09:12.82
You like that part.

94
00:09:12.82 --> 00:09:13.82
Yes.

95
00:09:13.82 --> 00:09:14.82
OK.

96
00:09:14.82 --> 00:09:15.82
Romans.

97
00:09:15.82 --> 00:09:16.82
OK.

98
00:09:16.82 --> 00:09:19.90
They thoroughly understood the importance of hardening them.

99
00:09:19.90 --> 00:09:22.50
So we're these talking about what the Romans are talking about the Romans.

100
00:09:22.50 --> 00:09:23.50
That's the day.

101
00:09:23.50 --> 00:09:27.74
They thoroughly understood the importance of hardening them by continual practice and of

102
00:09:27.74 --> 00:09:33.46
training them to every maneuver that might happen in the line and in action.

103
00:09:33.46 --> 00:09:42.02
How were they less strict in punishing idolness and sloth?

104
00:09:42.02 --> 00:09:47.42
See sometimes I stick up for like our generation or being modern, saying like, no, you

105
00:09:47.42 --> 00:09:49.10
know, we're kind of hardcore too.

106
00:09:49.10 --> 00:09:53.18
But then I read stuff like that and I kind of wonder.

107
00:09:53.18 --> 00:09:54.74
I kind of wonder.

108
00:09:54.74 --> 00:10:00.82
The courage of a soldier is heightened by his knowledge of his profession.

109
00:10:00.82 --> 00:10:05.86
He only wants an opportunity to execute what is he is convinced he has been perfectly

110
00:10:05.86 --> 00:10:06.86
taught.

111
00:10:06.86 --> 00:10:07.86
So that makes sense.

112
00:10:07.86 --> 00:10:10.22
I didn't interview a little while ago.

113
00:10:10.22 --> 00:10:15.98
And as it hasn't come out yet, it was with MPR, NPR, National Public Radio.

114
00:10:15.98 --> 00:10:17.94
But he was asking me.

115
00:10:17.94 --> 00:10:22.30
He had heard me saying in an interview that like I wanted to go to war.

116
00:10:22.30 --> 00:10:24.94
And he was kind of surprised about that.

117
00:10:24.94 --> 00:10:27.34
But that's exactly what this is talking about.

118
00:10:27.34 --> 00:10:31.58
I'm trained and you're convinced that you've been taught well and then you want to go

119
00:10:31.58 --> 00:10:36.14
get after it, especially when you're young.

120
00:10:36.14 --> 00:10:40.78
You have nothing to lose.

121
00:10:40.78 --> 00:10:46.50
Back to the book, a handful of men in NERD to war precede to certain victory while on the

122
00:10:46.50 --> 00:10:53.78
contrary, numerous armies of raw and undisciplined troops are but multitudes of men drag

123
00:10:53.78 --> 00:10:59.34
to the slaughter.

124
00:10:59.34 --> 00:11:01.34
No big deal.

125
00:11:01.34 --> 00:11:04.82
Multitudes of undisciplined men, you're just getting dragged to the slaughter.

126
00:11:04.82 --> 00:11:06.14
That's life.

127
00:11:06.14 --> 00:11:07.50
That's life.

128
00:11:07.50 --> 00:11:11.90
Oh, and here's another point.

129
00:11:11.90 --> 00:11:17.10
For it is certain that the less a man is acquainted with the sweets of life, the less

130
00:11:17.10 --> 00:11:20.34
reason he has to be afraid of death.

131
00:11:20.34 --> 00:11:22.42
Interesting.

132
00:11:22.42 --> 00:11:26.10
The young soldier, therefore, ought to have a lively eye.

133
00:11:26.10 --> 00:11:32.10
Oh, this is he's just talking about what the young recruits should be like, what kind

134
00:11:32.10 --> 00:11:33.86
of qualities they're supposed to have.

135
00:11:33.86 --> 00:11:38.22
The young soldier, therefore, ought to have a lively eye should carry his head erect,

136
00:11:38.22 --> 00:11:40.38
his chest and shoulders be broad.

137
00:11:40.38 --> 00:11:42.42
His shoulders muscular and brawny.

138
00:11:42.42 --> 00:11:47.50
His fingers long, his arms strong, and his waist, small.

139
00:11:47.50 --> 00:11:49.62
Going back to posture.

140
00:11:49.62 --> 00:11:52.66
Remember what that up with Jordan B. Peterson?

141
00:11:52.66 --> 00:11:55.06
He's got that chaplain as a book stand up straight with your shoulders back.

142
00:11:55.06 --> 00:11:57.62
I'm like, that's how you get indoctrinated in the military.

143
00:11:57.62 --> 00:12:00.54
That's been going on since the Roman times.

144
00:12:00.54 --> 00:12:01.70
There's something to it.

145
00:12:01.70 --> 00:12:03.58
I'm here to tell you.

146
00:12:03.58 --> 00:12:07.66
Talking more about the recruits, he says, they should be taught the use of their arms

147
00:12:07.66 --> 00:12:10.06
by constant and daily exercise.

148
00:12:10.06 --> 00:12:15.06
But this essential custom has long been abolished by the relaxation introduced by a long

149
00:12:15.06 --> 00:12:19.46
peace.

150
00:12:19.46 --> 00:12:21.70
Except that when things get easy.

151
00:12:21.70 --> 00:12:29.98
And again, working with business all the time, it's real easy when the times are good.

152
00:12:29.98 --> 00:12:30.98
Like the economies good.

153
00:12:30.98 --> 00:12:32.46
Right now, the economy is good.

154
00:12:32.46 --> 00:12:35.06
So people are just making money and everything is good.

155
00:12:35.06 --> 00:12:38.38
They don't train as hard, they don't prepare as much.

156
00:12:38.38 --> 00:12:39.98
Happens in everything.

157
00:12:39.98 --> 00:12:43.54
Yeah, because we kind of subconscious what seems like it anyway.

158
00:12:43.54 --> 00:12:45.90
Subconsciously rely on that kind of push.

159
00:12:45.90 --> 00:12:49.70
Like the stress will push you.

160
00:12:49.70 --> 00:12:50.70
The economy is not good.

161
00:12:50.70 --> 00:12:52.66
It's like, oh, I kind of pushed you to like, oh, we got to be sure.

162
00:12:52.66 --> 00:12:54.06
We don't work or whatever.

163
00:12:54.06 --> 00:12:56.58
And it kind of gives you some people.

164
00:12:56.58 --> 00:12:58.42
I think you actually do this.

165
00:12:58.42 --> 00:13:00.62
Some people perform better under pressure.

166
00:13:00.62 --> 00:13:06.22
The reason I say you, because you'll have a video to make, let's say.

167
00:13:06.22 --> 00:13:10.30
And if there's no deadline, let's just say there's no real.

168
00:13:10.30 --> 00:13:12.02
There's no real hope for urgency.

169
00:13:12.02 --> 00:13:14.70
I'm not expecting to see that.

170
00:13:14.70 --> 00:13:18.22
But then sometimes there's a deadline like for a master video.

171
00:13:18.22 --> 00:13:21.94
And there comes the deadline and boom, there's the video.

172
00:13:21.94 --> 00:13:26.38
Midnight, one o'clock in the morning into my email.

173
00:13:26.38 --> 00:13:27.42
You need that.

174
00:13:27.42 --> 00:13:29.10
You need that structure and discipline.

175
00:13:29.10 --> 00:13:30.10
Younger.

176
00:13:30.10 --> 00:13:31.10
It does help.

177
00:13:31.10 --> 00:13:32.10
Yeah.

178
00:13:32.10 --> 00:13:33.10
100%.

179
00:13:33.10 --> 00:13:39.02
Yeah, even time stuff like if you're like, hey, meet me at around seven.

180
00:13:39.02 --> 00:13:40.02
That's not good.

181
00:13:40.02 --> 00:13:43.10
Yeah, well, it'll be around whatever time.

182
00:13:43.10 --> 00:13:44.90
You might as well said, show up when you want.

183
00:13:44.90 --> 00:13:47.54
I love the dice a little bit today, because I said 1230.

184
00:13:47.54 --> 00:13:48.54
Yes, did you notice that?

185
00:13:48.54 --> 00:13:49.54
Yes.

186
00:13:49.54 --> 00:13:52.66
To me, when you put a number, I just assume that's the number.

187
00:13:52.66 --> 00:13:53.66
Yeah, that's how.

188
00:13:53.66 --> 00:13:54.66
That's the style.

189
00:13:54.66 --> 00:13:55.66
Yeah.

190
00:13:55.66 --> 00:13:56.66
That's probably good.

191
00:13:56.66 --> 00:13:57.66
Yeah.

192
00:13:57.66 --> 00:13:58.66
You're right.

193
00:13:58.66 --> 00:14:02.82
I think you do pretty good with being on time for me, actually.

194
00:14:02.82 --> 00:14:03.82
Yeah.

195
00:14:03.82 --> 00:14:04.82
Yeah.

196
00:14:04.82 --> 00:14:07.30
Well, I'm going to say you're battening pretty good average.

197
00:14:07.30 --> 00:14:08.30
Yeah.

198
00:14:08.30 --> 00:14:09.30
Yeah.

199
00:14:09.30 --> 00:14:12.34
Did you see someone asked how they could get your job?

200
00:14:12.34 --> 00:14:13.34
Yes.

201
00:14:13.34 --> 00:14:14.34
Yeah.

202
00:14:14.34 --> 00:14:15.34
Yeah.

203
00:14:15.34 --> 00:14:16.34
Yeah.

204
00:14:16.34 --> 00:14:17.34
Yeah.

205
00:14:17.34 --> 00:14:18.34
There you go.

206
00:14:18.34 --> 00:14:19.34
I guess we know that.

207
00:14:19.34 --> 00:14:21.34
Yeah, you got to do the price on your head.

208
00:14:21.34 --> 00:14:22.34
Yeah.

209
00:14:22.34 --> 00:14:24.34
Someone else maybe they can be on time.

210
00:14:24.34 --> 00:14:25.34
Yeah.

211
00:14:25.34 --> 00:14:27.34
That's really that's how they're required.

212
00:14:27.34 --> 00:14:28.34
Press record the entire.

213
00:14:28.34 --> 00:14:29.34
There you go.

214
00:14:29.34 --> 00:14:30.34
You little money.

215
00:14:30.34 --> 00:14:31.34
All right.

216
00:14:31.34 --> 00:14:35.34
Now, he's talking a little bit about a initial training going back to the book.

217
00:14:35.34 --> 00:14:40.58
The first thing the soldiers are to be taught is the military step, which can only

218
00:14:40.58 --> 00:14:44.26
be acquired by constant practice of marching quick and together.

219
00:14:44.26 --> 00:14:49.82
Nor is anything of more consequence either on the march or in the line, than they should

220
00:14:49.82 --> 00:14:56.22
keep their ranks with the greatest exactness for troops who march in irregular and disorderly

221
00:14:56.22 --> 00:15:00.86
manner are always in great danger of being defeated.

222
00:15:00.86 --> 00:15:03.14
And I read that part so I could read this part.

223
00:15:03.14 --> 00:15:08.16
They should march with the common military step 20 miles in five summer hours and with

224
00:15:08.16 --> 00:15:13.52
full step, which is quicker 24 miles in the same number of hours.

225
00:15:13.52 --> 00:15:15.64
So these guys can march.

226
00:15:15.64 --> 00:15:19.80
These guys can march and we've talked a lot about foot patrols.

227
00:15:19.80 --> 00:15:24.64
And in the in the seal teams, there's something called a forced march, which is like you're

228
00:15:24.64 --> 00:15:25.64
on a road.

229
00:15:25.64 --> 00:15:26.64
There's no threat.

230
00:15:26.64 --> 00:15:29.96
You're just marching and you're trying to move from point eight to point B. Don't

231
00:15:29.96 --> 00:15:31.12
do a lot of that in the seal teams.

232
00:15:31.12 --> 00:15:34.40
You don't even do it really much in the, well, I can't say that.

233
00:15:34.40 --> 00:15:35.64
But there's a difference.

234
00:15:35.64 --> 00:15:36.64
That's a forced march.

235
00:15:36.64 --> 00:15:42.56
And then there's patrolling where you're tactical and you're scanning your field to

236
00:15:42.56 --> 00:15:43.56
fire.

237
00:15:43.56 --> 00:15:45.36
These guys are talking about a forced road march.

238
00:15:45.36 --> 00:15:46.52
You're just on the road.

239
00:15:46.52 --> 00:15:48.76
It's basically your, you're going as fast as you can.

240
00:15:48.76 --> 00:15:51.72
So you're, it's just like, maybe what you don't have a rider.

241
00:15:51.72 --> 00:15:52.72
I mean, in your case.

242
00:15:52.72 --> 00:15:55.96
Yeah, we'll never ride for whatever reason.

243
00:15:55.96 --> 00:15:57.52
Well, in the seal teams, we usually add a ride.

244
00:15:57.52 --> 00:15:58.52
That's what you don't do.

245
00:15:58.52 --> 00:15:59.52
Yeah, that's what we don't do.

246
00:15:59.52 --> 00:16:00.52
Yeah, that's what we don't do.

247
00:16:00.52 --> 00:16:01.52
Gotcha.

248
00:16:01.52 --> 00:16:04.56
Oh, here's a good one.

249
00:16:04.56 --> 00:16:09.92
Learn to swim every young soldier without exception should in the summer months be taught

250
00:16:09.92 --> 00:16:16.56
to swim for it is sometimes impossible to pass rivers on bridges, but the flying and pursuing

251
00:16:16.56 --> 00:16:20.88
army, both are often obliged to swim over them.

252
00:16:20.88 --> 00:16:25.44
A sudden melting of snow or fall of rain often makes them overflow their banks.

253
00:16:25.44 --> 00:16:31.88
And in such a situation, the danger is as great from ignorance in swimming as from the

254
00:16:31.88 --> 00:16:33.52
enemy.

255
00:16:33.52 --> 00:16:38.28
I kind of take it for granted that people know how to swim, but it is not true.

256
00:16:38.28 --> 00:16:40.92
And when I figured that out when I went to Navy Bootcamp, because you'd think if you were

257
00:16:40.92 --> 00:16:43.60
joining the Navy, you'd know how to swim.

258
00:16:43.60 --> 00:16:44.60
No, not true.

259
00:16:44.60 --> 00:16:45.60
Yeah.

260
00:16:45.60 --> 00:16:46.60
Not true at all.

261
00:16:46.60 --> 00:16:48.76
People did not know a decent amount of people.

262
00:16:48.76 --> 00:16:50.08
Did not know how to swim.

263
00:16:50.08 --> 00:16:51.08
Yeah, I'm with you.

264
00:16:51.08 --> 00:16:54.92
I'm sure you don't come from Kui where everyone knows how to swim.

265
00:16:54.92 --> 00:16:59.08
Even at like two years old people, you know, how to swim, because you're on the island.

266
00:16:59.08 --> 00:17:00.08
Yeah, it's all.

267
00:17:00.08 --> 00:17:01.44
But yeah, man, there's people.

268
00:17:01.44 --> 00:17:02.44
Straight up.

269
00:17:02.44 --> 00:17:03.44
You haven't even seen the water.

270
00:17:03.44 --> 00:17:05.44
You know, like the ocean or whatever.

271
00:17:05.44 --> 00:17:07.44
Well, there's definitely people that haven't seen the ocean.

272
00:17:07.44 --> 00:17:08.44
Yeah.

273
00:17:08.44 --> 00:17:11.02
I mean, when I went to, when I went to Sealtrain, there was guys that had never been to the

274
00:17:11.02 --> 00:17:12.02
ocean before.

275
00:17:12.02 --> 00:17:13.02
Yeah.

276
00:17:13.02 --> 00:17:14.02
They were from Iowa.

277
00:17:14.02 --> 00:17:15.02
Yeah.

278
00:17:15.02 --> 00:17:17.02
You know, no, they just salt-wise the water tastes salty.

279
00:17:17.02 --> 00:17:18.02
Yeah.

280
00:17:18.02 --> 00:17:19.02
Yeah.

281
00:17:19.02 --> 00:17:20.02
Yeah.

282
00:17:20.02 --> 00:17:21.02
So yeah.

283
00:17:21.02 --> 00:17:22.02
Parents, teacher, kids out of swim.

284
00:17:22.02 --> 00:17:25.56
They have those good programs now where they do the little floating programs.

285
00:17:25.56 --> 00:17:28.20
So like even a little baby can float themselves and stuff.

286
00:17:28.20 --> 00:17:32.40
But you can look that up on YouTube and learn how to teach you.

287
00:17:32.40 --> 00:17:33.40
You're like baby to swim.

288
00:17:33.40 --> 00:17:34.40
Yes.

289
00:17:34.40 --> 00:17:35.40
And be carefree.

290
00:17:35.40 --> 00:17:36.40
Yeah.

291
00:17:36.40 --> 00:17:39.40
I'm throwing the, what's that call?

292
00:17:39.40 --> 00:17:40.40
The safety tip.

293
00:17:40.40 --> 00:17:41.40
Yeah.

294
00:17:41.40 --> 00:17:42.40
The safety tip.

295
00:17:42.40 --> 00:17:43.40
Yeah.

296
00:17:43.40 --> 00:17:45.08
That's, you've got to, you know, when you're doing anything in the water, you've got to be

297
00:17:45.08 --> 00:17:47.40
careful, really careful.

298
00:17:47.40 --> 00:17:48.40
Yeah.

299
00:17:48.40 --> 00:17:50.60
Even when you're training in the water, you've got to be really careful.

300
00:17:50.60 --> 00:17:52.04
One up, one down is the rule.

301
00:17:52.04 --> 00:17:54.44
Like if one person's doing some training, someone's got to stand there and watch

302
00:17:54.44 --> 00:17:55.44
him.

303
00:17:55.44 --> 00:17:56.44
Make sure that they're safe.

304
00:17:56.44 --> 00:17:57.44
But yeah.

305
00:17:57.44 --> 00:18:01.04
If you don't know, swim, they'll never swim.

306
00:18:01.04 --> 00:18:03.80
Back to the book.

307
00:18:03.80 --> 00:18:09.56
No state can either be happy or secure that is remiss and negligent in the discipline of

308
00:18:09.56 --> 00:18:15.36
its troops.

309
00:18:15.36 --> 00:18:20.48
For it is not profusion of riches or excess of luxury that can influence our enemies

310
00:18:20.48 --> 00:18:24.40
to court or respect us.

311
00:18:24.40 --> 00:18:30.44
This can only be affected by the terror of our arms.

312
00:18:30.44 --> 00:18:36.24
It is an observation of Kato that misconduct in the common affairs of life may be retrieved,

313
00:18:36.24 --> 00:18:41.72
but that it is quite otherwise in war where errors are fatal and without remedy and are

314
00:18:41.72 --> 00:18:44.52
followed by immediate punishment.

315
00:18:44.52 --> 00:18:50.04
For the consequences of engaging an enemy without skill or courage, is that part of the

316
00:18:50.04 --> 00:18:54.96
army is left on the field of battle and those who remain received such an impression

317
00:18:54.96 --> 00:19:00.40
from their defeat that they dare not afterwards look the enemy in the face.

318
00:19:00.40 --> 00:19:06.80
It's powerful stuff right there.

319
00:19:06.80 --> 00:19:11.28
This can only be affected by the terror of our arms.

320
00:19:11.28 --> 00:19:16.04
It's underlying there's little underlying threats of violence and everything that

321
00:19:16.04 --> 00:19:18.84
passions say everything but they're just they're all.

322
00:19:18.84 --> 00:19:21.92
Let me let me break down a little bit more because I don't want to make a broad statement

323
00:19:21.92 --> 00:19:22.92
about the whole world.

324
00:19:22.92 --> 00:19:26.48
But when I was a young guy in a sea of opaltoon, it was definitely underlying threats

325
00:19:26.48 --> 00:19:27.48
of violence.

326
00:19:27.48 --> 00:19:32.64
Even with a big smile or face, even amongst total bros, the thing that's underlying

327
00:19:32.64 --> 00:19:40.80
is like, well, you know, if this is going down, you know, we know how that could go.

328
00:19:40.80 --> 00:19:44.76
So yeah, have the discipline.

329
00:19:44.76 --> 00:19:45.76
Train.

330
00:19:45.76 --> 00:19:59.08
I don't know why I'm finding this book like almost comical in how just on point it is with

331
00:19:59.08 --> 00:20:00.24
everything I think about.

332
00:20:00.24 --> 00:20:01.24
I kind of noticed that.

333
00:20:01.24 --> 00:20:03.96
Yeah, I'm just I mean the whole opening thing.

334
00:20:03.96 --> 00:20:09.04
The whole opening, the opening onslaught of discipline.

335
00:20:09.04 --> 00:20:11.52
You know, I was straight up into it.

336
00:20:11.52 --> 00:20:17.32
So back to the book to a custom soldiers to carry burdens is also an essential part of

337
00:20:17.32 --> 00:20:19.60
discipline.

338
00:20:19.60 --> 00:20:24.80
Recruiting particular should be obliged frequently to carry a weight of not less than 60

339
00:20:24.80 --> 00:20:29.44
pounds exclusive of their arms and to march with it in the ranks.

340
00:20:29.44 --> 00:20:33.000
This is because on difficult expeditions, they often find themselves under the necessity

341
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.68
of carrying their provisions as well as their arms.

342
00:20:35.68 --> 00:20:40.000
Nor will they find this troublesome when in nerd to it by custom which makes everything

343
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
easy.

344
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.64
Boom, there you go.

345
00:20:43.64 --> 00:20:45.84
Where are the gear that you're where the gear that you're going to fight with?

346
00:20:45.84 --> 00:20:46.84
Get used to it.

347
00:20:46.84 --> 00:20:50.84
I used to talk about this with like discipline equals freedom.

348
00:20:50.84 --> 00:20:52.36
The whole idea of it.

349
00:20:52.36 --> 00:20:56.16
I'd say if you have a discipline to wear your gear all the time, then you'll have freedom

350
00:20:56.16 --> 00:20:57.92
movement when you need it.

351
00:20:57.92 --> 00:20:58.92
Right.

352
00:20:58.92 --> 00:21:00.88
You know, and I kind of felt like that was a stretch.

353
00:21:00.88 --> 00:21:02.28
Is that seem like a stretch?

354
00:21:02.28 --> 00:21:03.48
Well, no, no, no more.

355
00:21:03.48 --> 00:21:07.20
And anymore, this kind of, yeah, back into the non-stretch zone.

356
00:21:07.20 --> 00:21:09.32
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

357
00:21:09.32 --> 00:21:13.80
Because like, yeah, okay, so you have all your gear on, right?

358
00:21:13.80 --> 00:21:15.76
And Jody Middick was kind of talking about this.

359
00:21:15.76 --> 00:21:19.68
I think when you was like, oh man, you know, like, it was just a pain in the ass to wear

360
00:21:19.68 --> 00:21:20.92
and all this stuff.

361
00:21:20.92 --> 00:21:22.60
That feeling, you know, that's our real feeling.

362
00:21:22.60 --> 00:21:23.60
Man, this is a pain.

363
00:21:23.60 --> 00:21:27.56
Oh, this gear, this digging into my, you know, arm not used to it or kind of thing, but

364
00:21:27.56 --> 00:21:30.24
man, you get a guy who's really used to it by that's not even a factor.

365
00:21:30.24 --> 00:21:31.24
He's free to do that.

366
00:21:31.24 --> 00:21:32.84
There's two things that happens.

367
00:21:32.84 --> 00:21:33.84
Number one, you get used to it.

368
00:21:33.84 --> 00:21:36.32
Number two, you figure out your gear so that your gear works properly.

369
00:21:36.32 --> 00:21:38.88
Yeah, so it's like, yeah, you can.

370
00:21:38.88 --> 00:21:44.40
Because your gear when you first put it on no matter you go to the best gear store in

371
00:21:44.40 --> 00:21:47.04
the world and you buy gear and it's not going to fit you to quite right.

372
00:21:47.04 --> 00:21:48.24
You have to make little modifications.

373
00:21:48.24 --> 00:21:49.24
You have to adjust it.

374
00:21:49.24 --> 00:21:50.60
You have to put the weight somewhere else.

375
00:21:50.60 --> 00:21:54.68
Now in football, you wouldn't always wear your gear and practice, right?

376
00:21:54.68 --> 00:21:56.04
It was pretty designated.

377
00:21:56.04 --> 00:21:59.96
Like, depending on the day, you know, so, you know, two days, you have full gear, you know,

378
00:21:59.96 --> 00:22:02.56
two days, you have just helmets and shoulder pads or whatever.

379
00:22:02.56 --> 00:22:05.56
But yeah, you were, you were supposed to.

380
00:22:05.56 --> 00:22:10.28
One guy's would like maybe not wear their mouthpiece or something like that, but it'd

381
00:22:10.28 --> 00:22:11.28
be rare.

382
00:22:11.28 --> 00:22:15.72
I think in the NFL, like, they won't wear their thigh pads or their hip.

383
00:22:15.72 --> 00:22:17.68
And that's just because it's a pain.

384
00:22:17.68 --> 00:22:18.68
I don't know.

385
00:22:18.68 --> 00:22:20.68
I can't really speak for.

386
00:22:20.68 --> 00:22:25.12
I think I know that guys who run a lot and if you take out your thigh pads and your

387
00:22:25.12 --> 00:22:28.84
hip protectors and stuff, it helps you run for sure.

388
00:22:28.84 --> 00:22:29.84
But you run that risk.

389
00:22:29.84 --> 00:22:31.16
And you should train with it.

390
00:22:31.16 --> 00:22:32.48
You should train with it.

391
00:22:32.48 --> 00:22:34.12
But here's the thing, though.

392
00:22:34.12 --> 00:22:37.80
If there's a rule, because sometimes even in the game, they just won't wear it.

393
00:22:37.80 --> 00:22:39.28
They just simply won't wear it.

394
00:22:39.28 --> 00:22:41.000
But you do run the risk.

395
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.36
Like, if you get what's called a hip pointer, there's an injury called a hip pointer.

396
00:22:44.36 --> 00:22:46.56
It's basically your external bleaks.

397
00:22:46.56 --> 00:22:49.56
They kind of overlap your hip bone, right?

398
00:22:49.56 --> 00:22:54.20
And when a helmet or something hits that and crushes your external bleak against your

399
00:22:54.20 --> 00:22:56.000
hip bones called a hip pointer.

400
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:03.08
And it's a debilitating painful injury that kind of wear it, even in everyday life, you're

401
00:23:03.08 --> 00:23:04.08
out of the game.

402
00:23:04.08 --> 00:23:06.84
And I've had it before.

403
00:23:06.84 --> 00:23:09.56
So hip protectors will help against that.

404
00:23:09.56 --> 00:23:11.56
So you run that risk.

405
00:23:11.56 --> 00:23:13.20
So it's up to you, man.

406
00:23:13.20 --> 00:23:16.56
I mean, I think in college, I know in high school, it's a rule.

407
00:23:16.56 --> 00:23:20.20
You've got to wear a hip, but I think in the NFL you don't have to.

408
00:23:20.20 --> 00:23:21.20
Well, that's good.

409
00:23:21.20 --> 00:23:24.56
I think the overall point is, and it sounds like the football is on board with it.

410
00:23:24.56 --> 00:23:25.56
Train how you fight.

411
00:23:25.56 --> 00:23:26.56
Yeah.

412
00:23:26.56 --> 00:23:27.56
We're the gear.

413
00:23:27.56 --> 00:23:28.76
Train how you fight.

414
00:23:28.76 --> 00:23:33.76
But it's tough to go in, and this goes for any context that you're even, and really

415
00:23:33.76 --> 00:23:39.24
in the military, but it's almost like so obvious in the military that it's a given, where

416
00:23:39.24 --> 00:23:41.24
you can't train exactly how you fight.

417
00:23:41.24 --> 00:23:42.24
Yeah, sure.

418
00:23:42.24 --> 00:23:43.24
Yeah.

419
00:23:43.24 --> 00:23:45.24
And exactly, it's like I said, really.

420
00:23:45.24 --> 00:23:46.24
I used to tell guys that.

421
00:23:46.24 --> 00:23:51.92
I used to be like, hey, unfortunately, unfortunately, I can't put guys out here to actually

422
00:23:51.92 --> 00:23:52.92
kill you.

423
00:23:52.92 --> 00:23:53.92
You do the wrong way.

424
00:23:53.92 --> 00:23:55.28
Yeah, like you really want to do.

425
00:23:55.28 --> 00:24:01.08
Same thing for football as it turns out, where you can't just have guys going live

426
00:24:01.08 --> 00:24:02.08
five minutes a week.

427
00:24:02.08 --> 00:24:04.92
You know, on somebody hip pointers or you be, oh, yeah.

428
00:24:04.92 --> 00:24:05.92
Yeah.

429
00:24:05.92 --> 00:24:09.96
Actually, he's so he goes on to talk about, we talk about some slack.

430
00:24:09.96 --> 00:24:12.000
You're going back to the book.

431
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:20.40
But negligence and sloth having by degrees introduced a total relaxation of discipline.

432
00:24:20.40 --> 00:24:25.000
The soldiers began to think they're on or too heavy as they seldom put it on.

433
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.64
They first requested leave from the Emperor to lay aside the keras and afterwards the helmet

434
00:24:31.64 --> 00:24:36.44
and consequence of this are troops in their engagements with the Goths.

435
00:24:36.44 --> 00:24:40.40
We're often overwhelmed with their showers of arrows.

436
00:24:40.40 --> 00:24:41.40
So there you go.

437
00:24:41.40 --> 00:24:42.60
Start taking out a little shortcut.

438
00:24:42.60 --> 00:24:44.88
And like I always says, it's bi-pe greasep.

439
00:24:44.88 --> 00:24:48.16
Like no one just wakes up on the morning and says, I'm going to be weaker now.

440
00:24:48.16 --> 00:24:49.16
Yeah, yeah.

441
00:24:49.16 --> 00:24:50.16
It's over the floor.

442
00:24:50.16 --> 00:24:53.56
It's just, they just start to decay just a little bit.

443
00:24:53.56 --> 00:24:54.56
Yeah.

444
00:24:54.56 --> 00:24:55.56
Take a little shortcut.

445
00:24:55.56 --> 00:24:56.56
Yeah.

446
00:24:56.56 --> 00:24:59.72
You know, here's a, here's a, here's a workout.

447
00:24:59.72 --> 00:25:02.72
A workout tip.

448
00:25:02.72 --> 00:25:04.36
Jocos workout tips.

449
00:25:04.36 --> 00:25:05.36
I'm serious.

450
00:25:05.36 --> 00:25:08.44
This is like something that goes through my head.

451
00:25:08.44 --> 00:25:11.80
When I'm doing some exercise, let's say it's squat day.

452
00:25:11.80 --> 00:25:15.80
And let's say it's, I'm doing the 20 reps squats, which is just painful.

453
00:25:15.80 --> 00:25:16.80
Yes.

454
00:25:16.80 --> 00:25:22.68
And I have that thought in my head where sometimes you know, I go out and you know what?

455
00:25:22.68 --> 00:25:24.40
Just I'll just do 16 today.

456
00:25:24.40 --> 00:25:25.40
Yeah.

457
00:25:25.40 --> 00:25:27.80
Because you know, like, I mean, I worked really hard yesterday and I'm kind of tired.

458
00:25:27.80 --> 00:25:29.80
I'm still doing it until I did.

459
00:25:29.80 --> 00:25:30.80
Yeah.

460
00:25:30.80 --> 00:25:34.28
You know, I'm a bubble, I hear myself saying that.

461
00:25:34.28 --> 00:25:38.72
I always think like that's the, that's the first step down down the slippery slope.

462
00:25:38.72 --> 00:25:39.72
Okay.

463
00:25:39.72 --> 00:25:40.72
And I'm not going to do it.

464
00:25:40.72 --> 00:25:41.72
I'm not going to do it.

465
00:25:41.72 --> 00:25:43.16
Have you ever, I have you ever skipped it?

466
00:25:43.16 --> 00:25:44.16
Come on.

467
00:25:44.16 --> 00:25:45.16
Be real.

468
00:25:45.16 --> 00:25:46.28
Have you ever, have you ever skipped it?

469
00:25:46.28 --> 00:25:52.88
Like, you know, those doubts, not doubts, but those, those thoughts of, hey, let me, let me slack.

470
00:25:52.88 --> 00:25:53.88
Not skipping workout.

471
00:25:53.88 --> 00:25:54.88
I mean, have you ever given it?

472
00:25:54.88 --> 00:25:59.44
The only time where I've been like, you know what, I'm not finishing this workout is like

473
00:25:59.44 --> 00:26:00.44
I'll hurt something.

474
00:26:00.44 --> 00:26:01.44
Offer.

475
00:26:01.44 --> 00:26:05.56
And this way, and I've done it where I've done it where I haven't done it.

476
00:26:05.56 --> 00:26:06.56
That's a lesson learned.

477
00:26:06.56 --> 00:26:09.88
Like, I've been like, I remember one time on a squatting and I felt a little, you know, you

478
00:26:09.88 --> 00:26:11.88
know, you get a little twinge in your back.

479
00:26:11.88 --> 00:26:12.88
Yeah.

480
00:26:12.88 --> 00:26:15.72
I got one of those and then I kept going and then I was debilitated.

481
00:26:15.72 --> 00:26:18.000
I was like, I was like, not good.

482
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.64
But generally, if, yeah, I know, because it's this, that's why I'm saying this.

483
00:26:23.64 --> 00:26:26.12
That little conversation right there is a good conversation.

484
00:26:26.12 --> 00:26:30.56
Have for yourself because I think about, I think about that little, you just give

485
00:26:30.56 --> 00:26:35.08
that little bit of slack that time and it's not good.

486
00:26:35.08 --> 00:26:39.40
You know, it's like that, just in my mind, I'm thinking that leads to more slack right

487
00:26:39.40 --> 00:26:40.40
there.

488
00:26:40.40 --> 00:26:41.40
It does.

489
00:26:41.40 --> 00:26:42.40
That leads to a little bit more slack.

490
00:26:42.40 --> 00:26:46.56
Because next time, you're going to feel that way at 15 reps instead of 16.

491
00:26:46.56 --> 00:26:51.04
Yeah, because you've, even if it's subconsciously, you established a new little, a

492
00:26:51.04 --> 00:26:54.28
person that's a precedent which is kind of just the standard.

493
00:26:54.28 --> 00:26:55.28
Just a little bit.

494
00:26:55.28 --> 00:26:56.28
Yeah, it's exactly.

495
00:26:56.28 --> 00:26:59.60
So it's like, it's different if you're undefeated.

496
00:26:59.60 --> 00:27:00.60
Right.

497
00:27:00.60 --> 00:27:04.000
If you're undefeated, you either undefeated or you're not undefeated kind of thing.

498
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.28
Once you're defeated, then you're kind of like, okay, you know, let it sneak in there.

499
00:27:07.28 --> 00:27:08.28
Yeah.

500
00:27:08.28 --> 00:27:09.28
It's part of you now.

501
00:27:09.28 --> 00:27:10.28
Yeah.

502
00:27:10.28 --> 00:27:11.28
I got to say I'm defeated.

503
00:27:11.28 --> 00:27:14.48
I'm like, I do the, I do the met kind at the end.

504
00:27:14.48 --> 00:27:17.60
You know, I live and do met kind and it's, you know, good.

505
00:27:17.60 --> 00:27:21.84
And I will also straight up, I'll be honest that it doesn't happen very often.

506
00:27:21.84 --> 00:27:25.16
I mean, I talk a lot of trash water, but it doesn't happen very often.

507
00:27:25.16 --> 00:27:29.80
But oh, yeah, there's times where it'll be like, oh, well, that work out was pretty solid.

508
00:27:29.80 --> 00:27:31.52
I'll do, I'll make deals.

509
00:27:31.52 --> 00:27:33.48
That makes me, that makes me mad.

510
00:27:33.48 --> 00:27:34.48
That makes me mad.

511
00:27:34.48 --> 00:27:36.20
And I don't like that.

512
00:27:36.20 --> 00:27:42.08
Actually hanging with you made me give me that mindset, which is a mindset I simply

513
00:27:42.08 --> 00:27:43.08
did not have.

514
00:27:43.08 --> 00:27:44.08
Go deaf core.

515
00:27:44.08 --> 00:27:47.68
No, but you know how you said it makes you mad.

516
00:27:47.68 --> 00:27:48.88
Like, I never had that feeling.

517
00:27:48.88 --> 00:27:51.12
Never had that feeling like, oh, I'm making it.

518
00:27:51.12 --> 00:27:52.72
I just never thought of it that way.

519
00:27:52.72 --> 00:27:53.72
Like not even a little bit.

520
00:27:53.72 --> 00:27:55.60
Do you mean consider thinking it that way?

521
00:27:55.60 --> 00:27:58.32
But now, yeah, when I feel it, like, oh, maybe I'll do tomorrow.

522
00:27:58.32 --> 00:28:01.24
Really don't feel, I actually have that response.

523
00:28:01.24 --> 00:28:05.04
Where you kind of get mad at it at yourself trying to think, like you're split into

524
00:28:05.04 --> 00:28:06.04
people.

525
00:28:06.04 --> 00:28:07.04
That's a positive thing.

526
00:28:07.04 --> 00:28:08.04
It is.

527
00:28:08.04 --> 00:28:09.04
It helps.

528
00:28:09.04 --> 00:28:10.04
That's the death core right there.

529
00:28:10.04 --> 00:28:12.04
Straight up.

530
00:28:12.04 --> 00:28:13.04
Check.

531
00:28:13.04 --> 00:28:15.24
All right.

532
00:28:15.24 --> 00:28:16.24
Let's see.

533
00:28:16.24 --> 00:28:21.12
Going back to the book, it was a constant custom among the old Romans to exercise

534
00:28:21.12 --> 00:28:28.12
both cavalry and infantry three times a month by marches of a certain length.

535
00:28:28.12 --> 00:28:31.60
The foot were obliged to march completely armed.

536
00:28:31.60 --> 00:28:36.84
The distance of 10 miles from the camp and return in the most exact order and with the

537
00:28:36.84 --> 00:28:41.72
military step, which they changed and quickened on some part of the march.

538
00:28:41.72 --> 00:28:48.16
They made these marches not in plain and even ground only, but both cavalry and infantry were

539
00:28:48.16 --> 00:28:53.80
ordered into difficult and uneven places and to ascend or descend mountains to prepare

540
00:28:53.80 --> 00:28:59.16
them for all kinds of accidents and familiarize them with the different maneuvers that

541
00:28:59.16 --> 00:29:03.04
various situations of a country may require.

542
00:29:03.04 --> 00:29:05.24
It has put some miles in.

543
00:29:05.24 --> 00:29:11.40
But again, the reason that I wanted to mention that part is it's not just about wearing

544
00:29:11.40 --> 00:29:16.80
the gear, it's trying to simulate as closely as you can to the situation that you're going

545
00:29:16.80 --> 00:29:18.64
to be in.

546
00:29:18.64 --> 00:29:21.88
Same thing with anything, same thing with sports, same thing with business when you're

547
00:29:21.88 --> 00:29:27.32
training someone, when you're training someone for business, put them in that situation

548
00:29:27.32 --> 00:29:32.88
that they as close as you can to what they're going to be in.

549
00:29:32.88 --> 00:29:36.48
Here it continues to enumerate the different nations.

550
00:29:36.48 --> 00:29:41.56
So formidable of old, all which now are subject to the Romans would be tedious.

551
00:29:41.56 --> 00:29:45.52
So he's saying like, we beat down so many people we can't, but I'm going to take the time

552
00:29:45.52 --> 00:29:48.32
to talk about them all.

553
00:29:48.32 --> 00:29:53.04
But the security established by long peace has altered their dispositions, drawn them

554
00:29:53.04 --> 00:30:01.04
off from military to civil pursuits and infused into them a love of idolness and ease.

555
00:30:01.04 --> 00:30:06.08
Again, this guy's right in several hundred years after Caesar.

556
00:30:06.08 --> 00:30:11.80
So he's talking about the slippery slope.

557
00:30:11.80 --> 00:30:18.92
Hence a relaxation of military discipline, insensibly ensued, then in a collective it and

558
00:30:18.92 --> 00:30:25.36
it sunk at last into entire oblivion.

559
00:30:25.36 --> 00:30:31.84
So he's watching the fall of the Roman Empire and where does it start?

560
00:30:31.84 --> 00:30:38.08
It's a discipline in the troops, boom, I'll get the kick out of this button.

561
00:30:38.08 --> 00:30:44.92
The necessity therefore of discipline cannot be too often incoated as well as the strict

562
00:30:44.92 --> 00:30:49.72
attention, requisite in the choice and training of new levees.

563
00:30:49.72 --> 00:30:56.36
Don't you can't ever, can't ever let up the psyche, can't ever say it's okay not to do

564
00:30:56.36 --> 00:30:57.92
that rep.

565
00:30:57.92 --> 00:31:10.64
That's, in the book he goes into a long description of how they were organized, like

566
00:31:10.64 --> 00:31:16.84
man by man, troop by troop, not going to go too deep into that.

567
00:31:16.84 --> 00:31:21.12
One of the things he does mention in that section is about how when they stopped doing a good

568
00:31:21.12 --> 00:31:25.72
job replacing the soldiers that were leaving, you know, you're not keeping, you're not

569
00:31:25.72 --> 00:31:30.48
keeping people coming in, not keeping them trained up.

570
00:31:30.48 --> 00:31:31.48
This is a good thing.

571
00:31:31.48 --> 00:31:33.88
I think this is good for any team situation.

572
00:31:33.88 --> 00:31:41.32
The expense of keeping up good or bad troops is the same.

573
00:31:41.32 --> 00:31:42.92
But it depends wholly on you.

574
00:31:42.92 --> 00:31:45.80
So I think that's a good statement.

575
00:31:45.80 --> 00:31:49.52
You got some good members on your team, you got some bad members on the team.

576
00:31:49.52 --> 00:31:53.52
It cost you the same to keep them.

577
00:31:53.52 --> 00:32:03.36
You got to decide how you're going to manage that situation.

578
00:32:03.36 --> 00:32:04.36
Back to the book.

579
00:32:04.36 --> 00:32:10.56
In former times, the discipline was so strict that the tribunes or officers not only

580
00:32:10.56 --> 00:32:15.12
cause the troops under their command to be exercised daily in their presence, but were

581
00:32:15.12 --> 00:32:22.24
themselves so perfect in their military exercise as to set them by example.

582
00:32:22.24 --> 00:32:28.08
Something does so much honor to the abilities or application of the tribune as the appearance

583
00:32:28.08 --> 00:32:31.36
and discipline of the soldiers.

584
00:32:31.36 --> 00:32:36.28
When their apparel is neat and clean, their arms bright and in good order and when they

585
00:32:36.28 --> 00:32:43.84
perform their exercises and evolutions with the austerity.

586
00:32:43.84 --> 00:32:51.92
No big deal.

587
00:32:51.92 --> 00:32:53.64
More.

588
00:32:53.64 --> 00:33:02.68
He's talking about just keeping the elements organized in a combat situation.

589
00:33:02.68 --> 00:33:06.48
Lest the soldiers in the confusion of battle should be separated from their comrades

590
00:33:06.48 --> 00:33:11.68
every cohort had its shield painted in a manner peculiar to itself.

591
00:33:11.68 --> 00:33:16.52
The name of each soldier was also written on a shield together with the number of the

592
00:33:16.52 --> 00:33:23.64
cohort and century to which he belonged.

593
00:33:23.64 --> 00:33:28.000
I had a note in here about how we would name our vehicles.

594
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.24
So you'd know what vehicle to get into.

595
00:33:30.24 --> 00:33:32.24
The armies would have names.

596
00:33:32.24 --> 00:33:33.84
So you'd know what vehicle was yours.

597
00:33:33.84 --> 00:33:34.84
Well, the one called Zev.

598
00:33:34.84 --> 00:33:37.88
Yes, they had all kinds of names for him.

599
00:33:37.88 --> 00:33:41.68
My first deployment to Iraq.

600
00:33:41.68 --> 00:33:47.80
They were named after the movie.

601
00:33:47.80 --> 00:33:48.80
Oh, movie.

602
00:33:48.80 --> 00:33:50.60
They were named after a movie.

603
00:33:50.60 --> 00:33:53.20
It's about bowling, but it's not the big lebaoski.

604
00:33:53.20 --> 00:33:54.20
Kingpin.

605
00:33:54.20 --> 00:33:55.20
It was kingpin.

606
00:33:55.20 --> 00:33:56.20
That was the name.

607
00:33:56.20 --> 00:33:57.20
The other one.

608
00:33:57.20 --> 00:33:59.96
It was one of the homivies was called Bigger.

609
00:33:59.96 --> 00:34:03.92
Now what's interesting is the homivies originally were not named.

610
00:34:03.92 --> 00:34:04.92
They were numbered.

611
00:34:04.92 --> 00:34:07.92
One, two, three, four, five, six and that seems like a pretty square to weigh like a

612
00:34:07.92 --> 00:34:08.92
jockel would be good with that.

613
00:34:08.92 --> 00:34:09.92
Just give them a number.

614
00:34:09.92 --> 00:34:11.64
Here's a problem with it.

615
00:34:11.64 --> 00:34:17.12
When you're going on an operation, you go into a building to do a take down of a building.

616
00:34:17.12 --> 00:34:18.36
The vehicles move around.

617
00:34:18.36 --> 00:34:19.36
They got to adjust.

618
00:34:19.36 --> 00:34:23.80
And when you come back out, they might not necessarily be an orger numerically.

619
00:34:23.80 --> 00:34:25.36
So guys, but guys would go one, two, three.

620
00:34:25.36 --> 00:34:26.36
Oh, that's my vehicle.

621
00:34:26.36 --> 00:34:29.76
So they're getting along vehicle, which might not seem like a big deal.

622
00:34:29.76 --> 00:34:32.60
But then when you're trying to get a head count and someone's not the right vehicle,

623
00:34:32.60 --> 00:34:36.72
then the vehicle commander's like, I'm supposed to have eight guys and I only have seven.

624
00:34:36.72 --> 00:34:39.72
Now we're sitting on the X trying to get a head count.

625
00:34:39.72 --> 00:34:41.12
And that's problematic.

626
00:34:41.12 --> 00:34:44.000
If you know what your name of your vehicle is, you confirm it.

627
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:44.84
They're written on the side.

628
00:34:44.84 --> 00:34:45.84
Nice big letters.

629
00:34:45.84 --> 00:34:46.84
Yeah.

630
00:34:46.84 --> 00:34:47.84
Looking for big earn.

631
00:34:47.84 --> 00:34:48.84
You see it?

632
00:34:48.84 --> 00:34:49.84
You jump in.

633
00:34:49.84 --> 00:34:51.24
It makes sense with the numbers.

634
00:34:51.24 --> 00:34:57.04
Because I think just by nature, we assign numbers to things for all kinds of weird reasons.

635
00:34:57.04 --> 00:35:00.08
You know, like, where if there's three things in a room, like if I see, okay, there's

636
00:35:00.08 --> 00:35:03.16
three bottles in a row, mean you don't even have to know each other.

637
00:35:03.16 --> 00:35:05.12
And I say, hey, grab the third bottle.

638
00:35:05.12 --> 00:35:06.12
It's kind of, there's a shirt.

639
00:35:06.12 --> 00:35:07.88
There's a kind of ambiguous understanding.

640
00:35:07.88 --> 00:35:09.44
Okay, then want to further this one on the right.

641
00:35:09.44 --> 00:35:11.36
You know, it's like that. So the numbers can jam you.

642
00:35:11.36 --> 00:35:13.36
Well, we numbered this podcast.

643
00:35:13.36 --> 00:35:15.36
Yeah, because it's like chronological.

644
00:35:15.36 --> 00:35:16.36
Yeah.

645
00:35:16.36 --> 00:35:19.000
So interestingly, they could have had just names.

646
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
Yeah.

647
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.40
In fact, maybe they should have.

648
00:35:21.40 --> 00:35:23.36
Remember when the UFC's used to be numbered?

649
00:35:23.36 --> 00:35:24.36
Yeah.

650
00:35:24.36 --> 00:35:26.36
Or they're numbered.

651
00:35:26.36 --> 00:35:28.60
And then there's all no one was.

652
00:35:28.60 --> 00:35:29.60
This is what I was thinking.

653
00:35:29.60 --> 00:35:31.000
They used to give them a number.

654
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.80
And then they would have like a crazy name.

655
00:35:32.80 --> 00:35:33.80
Yeah, yeah, the title.

656
00:35:33.80 --> 00:35:34.80
Like that.

657
00:35:34.80 --> 00:35:35.80
Fetch and so I actually did.

658
00:35:35.80 --> 00:35:37.64
And then some glory or whatever.

659
00:35:37.64 --> 00:35:40.04
And then they just started just calling them the names of the guys

660
00:35:40.04 --> 00:35:40.88
that were fighting.

661
00:35:40.88 --> 00:35:41.40
Yeah.

662
00:35:41.40 --> 00:35:44.12
Which makes sense once you have, that's kind of what I'm thinking

663
00:35:44.12 --> 00:35:45.12
right now.

664
00:35:45.12 --> 00:35:49.16
Like someone that's looking for a certain episode.

665
00:35:49.16 --> 00:35:50.32
Yeah.

666
00:35:50.32 --> 00:35:52.28
They would, they might not remember the number,

667
00:35:52.28 --> 00:35:54.88
but they remembered the book or they remember the person.

668
00:35:54.88 --> 00:35:55.88
Yeah.

669
00:35:55.88 --> 00:35:56.88
That's kind of interesting.

670
00:35:56.88 --> 00:35:57.88
But we do kind of do it like that.

671
00:35:57.88 --> 00:35:59.88
Yeah, we kind of love.

672
00:35:59.88 --> 00:36:02.56
Yeah, one, what is, is there value to having a number

673
00:36:02.56 --> 00:36:06.96
aside from keeping a count of how many episodes there are?

674
00:36:06.96 --> 00:36:11.84
Well, I think someone now can, if you know what one you're looking

675
00:36:11.84 --> 00:36:15.96
for and then you find it, then you can go and find it easy

676
00:36:15.96 --> 00:36:17.12
in your platform.

677
00:36:17.12 --> 00:36:19.60
But the easiest way, if you want to know what,

678
00:36:19.60 --> 00:36:21.60
because sometimes I don't remember what a particular,

679
00:36:21.60 --> 00:36:26.96
if you Google, Jocco, podcast, and then whatever thing

680
00:36:26.96 --> 00:36:30.72
that you're looking for, it'll take you to the YouTube video.

681
00:36:30.72 --> 00:36:31.08
Right.

682
00:36:31.08 --> 00:36:32.80
It'll take you to the YouTube video.

683
00:36:32.80 --> 00:36:35.40
Yeah, because the YouTube videos are put the,

684
00:36:35.40 --> 00:36:38.44
somebody just told me on, on, somebody said,

685
00:36:38.44 --> 00:36:42.96
hey, you should review this book, Maurice Stradgercon.

686
00:36:42.96 --> 00:36:43.96
Stradgercon.

687
00:36:43.96 --> 00:36:45.48
Stradgercon, yeah.

688
00:36:45.48 --> 00:36:48.80
And I said, you should review this book.

689
00:36:48.80 --> 00:36:51.72
And this guy's like been in the game for a while.

690
00:36:51.72 --> 00:36:53.60
And I said, you should check out podcast,

691
00:36:53.60 --> 00:36:54.36
and I did it right away.

692
00:36:54.36 --> 00:36:57.68
Number one, so I Googled Jocco, Stradgercon.

693
00:36:57.68 --> 00:37:01.000
And I found 57, boom, done.

694
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.84
So now you can say, for the 70s, you go back

695
00:37:02.84 --> 00:37:03.64
and then look, right?

696
00:37:03.64 --> 00:37:04.48
Yeah.

697
00:37:04.48 --> 00:37:07.000
Check.

698
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:07.84
All right.

699
00:37:07.84 --> 00:37:10.16
Talking about drilling the troops back to the book,

700
00:37:10.16 --> 00:37:12.88
the younger soldiers and recruits went through

701
00:37:12.88 --> 00:37:15.76
their drills of every kind, every morning and afternoon,

702
00:37:15.76 --> 00:37:21.64
and the veterans and most expert regularly once a day.

703
00:37:21.64 --> 00:37:27.28
Length of service or age alone will never form a military man.

704
00:37:27.28 --> 00:37:31.000
For after serving many years, an undisciplined soldier

705
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
is still a novice in his profession.

706
00:37:37.76 --> 00:37:42.76
By practice, only can be acquired a guilty of body

707
00:37:42.76 --> 00:37:45.80
and the skill requisite to engage an enemy

708
00:37:45.80 --> 00:37:49.000
with advantage, especially in a close fight.

709
00:37:50.28 --> 00:37:53.000
But the most essential point of all is to teach soldiers

710
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.88
to keep their ranks and never abandon their colors

711
00:37:55.88 --> 00:37:57.72
in the most difficult evolutions.

712
00:37:57.72 --> 00:38:01.80
Thus men thus trained are never at a loss amidst

713
00:38:01.80 --> 00:38:05.28
the greatest confusion of numbers.

714
00:38:05.28 --> 00:38:07.36
The recruits likewise are to be exercised

715
00:38:07.36 --> 00:38:09.32
with wooden swords at the post,

716
00:38:09.32 --> 00:38:11.92
to be taught to attack this imaginary antagonist

717
00:38:11.92 --> 00:38:15.60
on all sides into aim at the side to feet or head,

718
00:38:15.60 --> 00:38:18.16
both with the point and edge of the sword.

719
00:38:18.16 --> 00:38:23.16
I think some of those movies that came out,

720
00:38:26.04 --> 00:38:29.04
because this is in sound glorious to me.

721
00:38:29.04 --> 00:38:31.96
Maybe it doesn't do you, but to me, that sounds awesome.

722
00:38:31.96 --> 00:38:34.40
And then like movies like Brave Heart,

723
00:38:34.40 --> 00:38:37.08
where they're showing kind of the sword battles

724
00:38:37.08 --> 00:38:39.72
and how just psycho it was.

725
00:38:39.72 --> 00:38:41.40
I think that's a good reminder.

726
00:38:41.40 --> 00:38:48.40
Yeah, big time. Back to the book, in short,

727
00:38:48.40 --> 00:38:51.40
both Legionary and Arggzilla Retroops should continually be drilled

728
00:38:56.40 --> 00:39:00.40
in cutting wood, carrying burdens, passing ditches, swimming in the sea

729
00:39:00.40 --> 00:39:04.40
or rivers, marching in the full step and even running with their arms

730
00:39:04.40 --> 00:39:08.40
and baggage so that in order to labor in peace,

731
00:39:08.40 --> 00:39:11.40
they may find no difficulty in war.

732
00:39:13.80 --> 00:39:17.40
Four, as the well-trained soldier is eager for action,

733
00:39:17.40 --> 00:39:21.000
so does the untot fear it.

734
00:39:23.20 --> 00:39:26.80
In war, discipline is superior to strength.

735
00:39:27.60 --> 00:39:29.80
But if that discipline is neglected,

736
00:39:29.80 --> 00:39:33.80
there is no longer any difference between the soldier and the peasant.

737
00:39:33.80 --> 00:39:38.80
The old maxim is certain that the very essence of an art

738
00:39:40.80 --> 00:39:44.80
consists in constant practice.

739
00:39:48.80 --> 00:39:51.80
Yeah, discipline is superior to strength.

740
00:39:56.80 --> 00:39:58.80
This is a solid book.

741
00:39:58.80 --> 00:40:05.80
The art, the very essence of an art consists in constant practice.

742
00:40:05.80 --> 00:40:07.80
So whatever it is, you want to be good at.

743
00:40:07.80 --> 00:40:09.80
Yeah. That's how you get good at it.

744
00:40:09.80 --> 00:40:11.80
Lately I just wrote another book.

745
00:40:11.80 --> 00:40:13.80
We've been writing a lot.

746
00:40:13.80 --> 00:40:15.80
I've been writing a ton, and you can see,

747
00:40:15.80 --> 00:40:19.80
the first draft was probably five times better than our first draft

748
00:40:19.80 --> 00:40:21.80
of our first book.

749
00:40:21.80 --> 00:40:25.80
And we both have done a lot of writing in the military,

750
00:40:25.80 --> 00:40:28.80
you know, in college and all that, but you practice,

751
00:40:28.80 --> 00:40:30.80
you get better.

752
00:40:31.80 --> 00:40:34.80
Jiu Jitsu, guess what, you practice, you get better.

753
00:40:36.80 --> 00:40:37.80
Pull ups.

754
00:40:37.80 --> 00:40:40.80
You're going to pull ups, do pull ups.

755
00:40:43.80 --> 00:40:45.80
Here we go.

756
00:40:46.80 --> 00:40:51.80
The last demonians made war their chief study.

757
00:40:51.80 --> 00:40:56.80
They affirmed to be the first who reasoned on the events of battles

758
00:40:56.80 --> 00:40:59.80
and committed their observations there on to writing

759
00:40:59.80 --> 00:41:02.80
with such success as to reduce the military art

760
00:41:02.80 --> 00:41:06.80
before considered as totally dependent on courage or fortune

761
00:41:06.80 --> 00:41:10.80
to contain two certain rules and fixed principles.

762
00:41:13.80 --> 00:41:16.80
As a consequence, they established schools of tactics

763
00:41:16.80 --> 00:41:21.80
for the instruction of youth in all the maneuvers of war.

764
00:41:21.80 --> 00:41:24.80
How worthy of admiration are these people

765
00:41:24.80 --> 00:41:29.80
for particularly applying themselves to the study of an art

766
00:41:29.80 --> 00:41:34.80
without which no other art can possibly exist?

767
00:41:34.80 --> 00:41:36.80
Boom.

768
00:41:37.80 --> 00:41:39.80
That's interesting.

769
00:41:39.80 --> 00:41:41.80
It's interesting, can you imagine it? Well, for me,

770
00:41:41.80 --> 00:41:43.80
you know, actually, I can't imagine.

771
00:41:43.80 --> 00:41:47.80
When you're a kid, you think like war is just like,

772
00:41:47.80 --> 00:41:48.80
just charge.

773
00:41:48.80 --> 00:41:51.80
And then as soon as you get into the teams,

774
00:41:51.80 --> 00:41:53.80
you're like, oh, there's maneuvers you can do.

775
00:41:53.80 --> 00:41:55.80
There's things you need to make happen.

776
00:41:55.80 --> 00:41:57.80
There's ways you can get advantage.

777
00:41:57.80 --> 00:41:59.80
It's not just what they call it, courage or fortune.

778
00:41:59.80 --> 00:42:00.80
It's not just that at all.

779
00:42:00.80 --> 00:42:02.80
There's a whole lot of things involved.

780
00:42:02.80 --> 00:42:04.80
And it's also interesting that they were doing,

781
00:42:04.80 --> 00:42:09.80
they were doing studies and debriefs on the war,

782
00:42:09.80 --> 00:42:10.80
on the battles.

783
00:42:10.80 --> 00:42:13.80
Because it sounds like people weren't, and he says, hey, look,

784
00:42:13.80 --> 00:42:15.80
they were the first two reasoned on the events of battles

785
00:42:15.80 --> 00:42:17.80
and committed their observations they're on to writing,

786
00:42:17.80 --> 00:42:22.80
with such a success to figure out that there's a military art.

787
00:42:24.80 --> 00:42:28.80
And how fired up is it that

788
00:42:31.80 --> 00:42:37.80
to study this art of war without which no other art can possibly exist?

789
00:42:37.80 --> 00:42:40.80
Two strong for you?

790
00:42:40.80 --> 00:42:43.80
You're not strong for every strong.

791
00:42:43.80 --> 00:42:46.80
I can see that's a bold statement for sure.

792
00:42:46.80 --> 00:42:47.80
It's a real bold statement.

793
00:42:47.80 --> 00:42:51.80
I don't think I thought about it enough to offer any sort of opinion.

794
00:42:51.80 --> 00:42:54.80
No, I'm the deal, but hey, man, I dig it.

795
00:42:54.80 --> 00:42:56.80
Kind of like exercise in life, right?

796
00:42:56.80 --> 00:42:57.80
Or healthy in life.

797
00:42:57.80 --> 00:42:58.80
Yeah, that's true.

798
00:42:58.80 --> 00:42:59.80
But yeah, sure.

799
00:42:59.80 --> 00:43:00.80
Cool.

800
00:43:00.80 --> 00:43:02.80
You seem pretty fired up a bit.

801
00:43:02.80 --> 00:43:03.80
You seem pretty fired up a bit.

802
00:43:03.80 --> 00:43:05.80
You do.

803
00:43:05.80 --> 00:43:10.80
And this is where George Washington statement kind of paraphrased from.

804
00:43:10.80 --> 00:43:14.80
Back to the book, he, therefore, who desires peace,

805
00:43:14.80 --> 00:43:16.80
should prepare for war.

806
00:43:18.80 --> 00:43:23.80
He who aspires to victory should spare no pains to form his soldiers.

807
00:43:24.80 --> 00:43:29.80
And he who hopes for success should fight on principle, not chance.

808
00:43:29.80 --> 00:43:37.80
No one dares to offend or insult a power of known superiority in action.

809
00:43:41.80 --> 00:43:45.80
You get bummed out that unit learn this in third grade, like this whole thing.

810
00:43:47.80 --> 00:43:51.80
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, including Jiu Jitsu for sure.

811
00:43:51.80 --> 00:43:53.80
Yeah, well, yeah.

812
00:43:53.80 --> 00:43:59.80
I feel like you kind of, I learned this kind of from you in the beginning,

813
00:43:59.80 --> 00:44:02.80
where, you know, how you have this kind of big picture kind of mindset.

814
00:44:02.80 --> 00:44:03.80
And I liked it.

815
00:44:03.80 --> 00:44:07.80
The long game, you always like, you always correct me when I have this, like,

816
00:44:07.80 --> 00:44:08.80
sort of certain term.

817
00:44:08.80 --> 00:44:09.80
Yeah.

818
00:44:09.80 --> 00:44:12.80
That's what I wish I understood slash even.

819
00:44:12.80 --> 00:44:14.80
I don't know if kids are even capable.

820
00:44:14.80 --> 00:44:14.80
Yeah.

821
00:44:14.80 --> 00:44:15.80
Really?

822
00:44:15.80 --> 00:44:17.80
Well, no, you're 100% right.

823
00:44:17.80 --> 00:44:22.80
And I've actually said this many times that kids have a hard time.

824
00:44:22.80 --> 00:44:27.80
Connecting what they're doing now with where it puts them in the future.

825
00:44:27.80 --> 00:44:31.80
And I say kids and by kids, I mean me, everyone.

826
00:44:31.80 --> 00:44:32.80
Yeah.

827
00:44:32.80 --> 00:44:33.80
I mean, I'm better now.

828
00:44:33.80 --> 00:44:33.80
Yeah.

829
00:44:33.80 --> 00:44:38.80
But when you're, when you're a kid, like it made, and kids, some kids are different.

830
00:44:38.80 --> 00:44:43.80
You know, like some of my, some of the kids that my kids hang around with,

831
00:44:43.80 --> 00:44:46.80
some of them are dialed, where they've just got a vision.

832
00:44:46.80 --> 00:44:47.80
They know where they're going.

833
00:44:47.80 --> 00:44:48.80
They know where they're going.

834
00:44:48.80 --> 00:44:49.80
They know where they're going to be in eight years.

835
00:44:49.80 --> 00:44:50.80
They know what they want to do.

836
00:44:50.80 --> 00:44:53.80
That's not a majority of the kids.

837
00:44:53.80 --> 00:44:58.80
Most kids are, you know, like, well, hey, I can get this right now.

838
00:44:58.80 --> 00:44:59.80
And that's cool.

839
00:44:59.80 --> 00:45:01.80
And they don't think about how it's going to affect when the future.

840
00:45:01.80 --> 00:45:04.80
And that's, that's, that's just really problematic.

841
00:45:04.80 --> 00:45:05.80
Yeah.

842
00:45:05.80 --> 00:45:08.80
Not understanding that long game is really problematic.

843
00:45:08.80 --> 00:45:15.80
And I think we do a bad job of teaching it as parents and as teachers and as a society.

844
00:45:15.80 --> 00:45:16.80
Yeah.

845
00:45:16.80 --> 00:45:17.80
Yeah.

846
00:45:17.80 --> 00:45:18.80
Okay.

847
00:45:18.80 --> 00:45:23.80
Well, I mean, there's, because you have, you know, like,

848
00:45:23.80 --> 00:45:28.80
JP says this and, and Laced this where when I was a kid,

849
00:45:28.80 --> 00:45:30.80
even you say you want to be some sort of a commando.

850
00:45:30.80 --> 00:45:31.80
Yeah.

851
00:45:31.80 --> 00:45:35.80
At least you had like an idea, you know, so there's, at the very least,

852
00:45:35.80 --> 00:45:37.80
somewhat in your mind to be like, hey, for sure.

853
00:45:37.80 --> 00:45:40.80
If I do this, that was, that was a savior.

854
00:45:40.80 --> 00:45:41.80
Yeah.

855
00:45:41.80 --> 00:45:45.80
So I think some families just through tradition and stuff like that,

856
00:45:45.80 --> 00:45:47.80
they'll have that structure.

857
00:45:47.80 --> 00:45:48.80
Hey, you're up.

858
00:45:48.80 --> 00:45:49.80
I don't know.

859
00:45:49.80 --> 00:45:50.80
You're a Johnson.

860
00:45:50.80 --> 00:45:51.80
So you do this, X, Y, Z.

861
00:45:51.80 --> 00:45:54.80
And it's just a matter of getting the kid to embrace that,

862
00:45:54.80 --> 00:45:56.80
which it's really kind of like, either they do it.

863
00:45:56.80 --> 00:45:57.80
They know all the tasks.

864
00:45:57.80 --> 00:45:58.80
Yeah.

865
00:45:58.80 --> 00:46:02.80
I mean, I think if you're fair to your kids, because a lot of times,

866
00:46:02.80 --> 00:46:05.80
like, we get caught up in like our own feelings, you know,

867
00:46:05.80 --> 00:46:07.80
in this thing like, you know, I don't know.

868
00:46:07.80 --> 00:46:08.80
You kids not listen to you or some like that.

869
00:46:08.80 --> 00:46:10.80
You're like, oh, my kids not listening to me.

870
00:46:10.80 --> 00:46:13.80
You know, you get caught up in the feeling that emotions.

871
00:46:13.80 --> 00:46:14.80
Yeah.

872
00:46:14.80 --> 00:46:16.80
You know, that rather than, hey, you know,

873
00:46:16.80 --> 00:46:18.80
this is a problem that needs to be solved to kind of thing.

874
00:46:18.80 --> 00:46:22.80
So I think that's the way you can alienate your kids real easy.

875
00:46:22.80 --> 00:46:23.80
And it's a common thing.

876
00:46:23.80 --> 00:46:26.80
I think where, you know, well alienator kids,

877
00:46:26.80 --> 00:46:30.80
and then they won't embrace the pride and tradition of your family.

878
00:46:30.80 --> 00:46:31.80
Because they're like alienated.

879
00:46:31.80 --> 00:46:32.80
You alienated.

880
00:46:32.80 --> 00:46:33.80
You alienated me.

881
00:46:33.80 --> 00:46:34.80
One way or another.

882
00:46:34.80 --> 00:46:35.80
Sometimes you don't even know you alienated.

883
00:46:35.80 --> 00:46:37.80
You know, they're like, oh, he's in a rebellious phase.

884
00:46:37.80 --> 00:46:41.80
You know, like, sure, there is such thing as a rebellious kind of phase.

885
00:46:41.80 --> 00:46:42.80
Yeah, you know, sure.

886
00:46:42.80 --> 00:46:46.80
And they gather this or they gain the sense of like empowerment in certain ways.

887
00:46:46.80 --> 00:46:47.80
You know, they want to test it out.

888
00:46:47.80 --> 00:46:48.80
They want to test about it.

889
00:46:48.80 --> 00:46:48.80
Yeah.

890
00:46:48.80 --> 00:46:50.80
You know, that, it's a concept that they know.

891
00:46:50.80 --> 00:46:51.80
They got to break away from their parents.

892
00:46:51.80 --> 00:46:53.80
That's something they got to start practicing that.

893
00:46:53.80 --> 00:46:53.80
Yeah.

894
00:46:53.80 --> 00:46:55.80
It seems, it seems natural.

895
00:46:55.80 --> 00:46:58.80
But if you have successfully alienated your kid,

896
00:46:58.80 --> 00:47:00.80
when that rebellious phase comes,

897
00:47:00.80 --> 00:47:02.80
they're stepping right outside the game.

898
00:47:02.80 --> 00:47:03.80
They're starting their own thing.

899
00:47:03.80 --> 00:47:05.80
In fact, they're going to have some resentment against

900
00:47:05.80 --> 00:47:08.80
Dad who's this unfair tyrant who's lame.

901
00:47:08.80 --> 00:47:09.80
Heaps this.

902
00:47:09.80 --> 00:47:13.80
It's just stuff like the kids never think their parents know anything.

903
00:47:13.80 --> 00:47:14.80
No, no, no.

904
00:47:14.80 --> 00:47:17.80
You know, as a parent, I understand why I totally don't like,

905
00:47:17.80 --> 00:47:18.80
I say, I get it.

906
00:47:18.80 --> 00:47:20.80
No, but that is funny.

907
00:47:20.80 --> 00:47:21.80
That is pretty funny.

908
00:47:21.80 --> 00:47:22.80
I mean, we just don't.

909
00:47:22.80 --> 00:47:23.80
It's not just parents.

910
00:47:23.80 --> 00:47:24.80
Like your teachers don't know anything.

911
00:47:24.80 --> 00:47:26.80
I'm not speaking for everybody, but like when I was a kid,

912
00:47:26.80 --> 00:47:28.80
parents didn't know anything.

913
00:47:28.80 --> 00:47:29.80
Teachers didn't know anything.

914
00:47:29.80 --> 00:47:30.80
I knew everything.

915
00:47:30.80 --> 00:47:30.80
Much of darks.

916
00:47:30.80 --> 00:47:31.80
Much of idiots.

917
00:47:31.80 --> 00:47:33.80
God, I'm stupid.

918
00:47:33.80 --> 00:47:36.80
So if you're listening to this and you're,

919
00:47:36.80 --> 00:47:38.80
you know, under the age of 40,

920
00:47:38.80 --> 00:47:41.80
you might want to listen to your.

921
00:47:41.80 --> 00:47:42.80
All right.

922
00:47:42.80 --> 00:47:43.80
That's good stuff.

923
00:47:43.80 --> 00:47:45.80
He who desires peace should prepare for war.

924
00:47:45.80 --> 00:47:48.80
Remember that one.

925
00:47:48.80 --> 00:47:52.80
Back to the book.

926
00:47:52.80 --> 00:47:54.80
And army to numerous.

927
00:47:54.80 --> 00:47:56.80
So now he's talking about the size of the army.

928
00:47:56.80 --> 00:47:59.80
The army to numerous is subject to many dangers and inconveniences.

929
00:47:59.80 --> 00:48:03.80
Its bulk makes its slow and unwieldy in its motions.

930
00:48:03.80 --> 00:48:06.80
And it is obliged to march and columns of great length.

931
00:48:06.80 --> 00:48:10.80
That is exposed to the risk of being continually harassed and insulted by

932
00:48:10.80 --> 00:48:13.80
inconsiderable parties of the enemy.

933
00:48:13.80 --> 00:48:18.80
The enumy, the enumy of the baggage is often an occasion of its being

934
00:48:18.80 --> 00:48:23.80
surprised in its passage throughout difficult places or over rivers.

935
00:48:23.80 --> 00:48:29.80
The difficulty of providing forage for such numbers of horses and other beasts of burden is very

936
00:48:29.80 --> 00:48:30.80
great.

937
00:48:30.80 --> 00:48:33.80
Besides the scarcity of provisions,

938
00:48:33.80 --> 00:48:38.80
which is to be carefully guarded against in all expeditions,

939
00:48:38.80 --> 00:48:42.80
soon ruin such large armies with the consumption.

940
00:48:42.80 --> 00:48:47.80
It's so great that notwithstanding the greatest care and filling the magazines,

941
00:48:47.80 --> 00:48:49.80
they must begin to fail in a short time.

942
00:48:49.80 --> 00:48:53.80
And sometimes they unavoidably will be distressed for want of water.

943
00:48:53.80 --> 00:48:56.80
But if unfortunately this immense army should be defeated,

944
00:48:56.80 --> 00:48:59.80
the numbers lost must necessarily be very great.

945
00:48:59.80 --> 00:49:03.80
And the remainder who save themselves by flight too much

946
00:49:03.80 --> 00:49:07.80
disperited to be brought to action again.

947
00:49:07.80 --> 00:49:10.80
And I read that whole thing so I could read this,

948
00:49:10.80 --> 00:49:12.80
which is saying hey, like you get too many people.

949
00:49:12.80 --> 00:49:14.80
I read that whole thing so I could read this.

950
00:49:14.80 --> 00:49:18.80
The ancients taught by experience,

951
00:49:18.80 --> 00:49:21.80
preferred discipline to numbers.

952
00:49:21.80 --> 00:49:27.80
Like we'd rather just have a small square away group than a ton of guys.

953
00:49:27.80 --> 00:49:31.80
So where I see this with businesses, this is what businesses.

954
00:49:31.80 --> 00:49:33.80
Is as businesses grow,

955
00:49:33.80 --> 00:49:36.80
it becomes harder for them to turn, right?

956
00:49:36.80 --> 00:49:38.80
It's harder for them to pivot.

957
00:49:38.80 --> 00:49:42.80
Oh yeah, yeah, so you get big companies that when they were small,

958
00:49:42.80 --> 00:49:45.80
they were all agile and they were making things happen and they can change direction.

959
00:49:45.80 --> 00:49:48.80
And then as they get bigger and bigger and bigger, they lose the ability to do that.

960
00:49:48.80 --> 00:49:50.80
And so you got to pay attention to that.

961
00:49:50.80 --> 00:49:53.80
And what you have to do, there's a couple of solutions.

962
00:49:53.80 --> 00:49:56.80
It's like the solution is yeah, you can stay small,

963
00:49:56.80 --> 00:49:59.80
but you don't want to spend it's day small as a business because you can't just like, you know,

964
00:49:59.80 --> 00:50:03.80
it's coldest, stay small as an army, but there's only so much you can do with limited number of people.

965
00:50:03.80 --> 00:50:08.80
So what you have to do is you have to start to become more aware of what's going,

966
00:50:08.80 --> 00:50:11.80
what's going, what's coming down the pipe in the future.

967
00:50:11.80 --> 00:50:15.80
Because it's going to take longer for you to pivot this big monster you've got.

968
00:50:15.80 --> 00:50:16.80
Yeah.

969
00:50:16.80 --> 00:50:17.80
So you've got to do it.

970
00:50:17.80 --> 00:50:19.80
You've got to pay more attention.

971
00:50:19.80 --> 00:50:21.80
So when you grow in size,

972
00:50:21.80 --> 00:50:22.80
this is classic.

973
00:50:22.80 --> 00:50:26.80
When you grow in size, a business,

974
00:50:26.80 --> 00:50:32.80
if the leaders of the business continue to focus down and in to the company,

975
00:50:32.80 --> 00:50:36.80
they won't see what's coming over the horizon.

976
00:50:36.80 --> 00:50:40.80
And that's when they get caught off guard and now they don't have time to pivot because they're a lot bigger.

977
00:50:40.80 --> 00:50:42.80
But they used to get away with it because they were a little small company.

978
00:50:42.80 --> 00:50:47.80
They could come to work on Monday and they could talk to everyone and one sitting and everyone gets on board and we move forward.

979
00:50:47.80 --> 00:50:50.80
You fast forward that and you go from 50 employees to 500.

980
00:50:50.80 --> 00:50:55.80
That are now spread out over a large geography.

981
00:50:55.80 --> 00:50:57.80
You can't make that quick move.

982
00:50:57.80 --> 00:51:00.80
And so what you have to do as a leader as you grow,

983
00:51:00.80 --> 00:51:06.80
you need to adjust your frame of vision from looking down inside your company to looking up and into the future.

984
00:51:06.80 --> 00:51:09.80
If you don't make that transition, you can't.

985
00:51:09.80 --> 00:51:11.80
You think you can turn things quickly.

986
00:51:11.80 --> 00:51:12.80
You can't.

987
00:51:12.80 --> 00:51:13.80
You can't.

988
00:51:13.80 --> 00:51:16.80
It's a big army and a big army has to be.

989
00:51:16.80 --> 00:51:19.80
It's hard to control a big army and it takes more lead time.

990
00:51:19.80 --> 00:51:25.80
And so that's the focus that you have to adjust to as you grow.

991
00:51:25.80 --> 00:51:27.80
Yes, good to have fun.

992
00:51:27.80 --> 00:51:29.80
So how do you do it then?

993
00:51:29.80 --> 00:51:30.80
Like you as the.

994
00:51:30.80 --> 00:51:33.80
Well, what you do is you have people underneath you.

995
00:51:33.80 --> 00:51:35.80
If you're making widgets and I wasn't, we started off.

996
00:51:35.80 --> 00:51:40.80
We had eight people and I was in the factory all day checking out your widgets and making sure that they were good to go.

997
00:51:40.80 --> 00:51:43.80
And I was testing them myself and I was making little adjustments.

998
00:51:43.80 --> 00:51:44.80
That's cool.

999
00:51:44.80 --> 00:51:45.80
That's fine.

1000
00:51:45.80 --> 00:51:46.80
It works when we had eight people.

1001
00:51:46.80 --> 00:51:49.80
But now when we get 40 people, I need to start going, okay, echo.

1002
00:51:49.80 --> 00:51:51.80
Can you pay attention to widgets in here?

1003
00:51:51.80 --> 00:51:56.80
And then when I get to 300 people, I need to have four or five echoes that are down there that are watching this stuff.

1004
00:51:56.80 --> 00:51:57.80
So that's what you got to do.

1005
00:51:57.80 --> 00:51:58.80
You got to adjust your field of vision.

1006
00:51:58.80 --> 00:52:00.80
You got to adjust your focus or all to you.

1007
00:52:00.80 --> 00:52:09.80
And what fools people, what fools people, what catches them off guard is that they think they can still pivot quickly.

1008
00:52:09.80 --> 00:52:13.80
Because they were able to do it when they were smaller when they had 30 or 40 people.

1009
00:52:13.80 --> 00:52:14.80
They were able to pivot quickly.

1010
00:52:14.80 --> 00:52:16.80
They got 300, they can't do it.

1011
00:52:16.80 --> 00:52:18.80
And they get caught off guard.

1012
00:52:18.80 --> 00:52:20.80
Here, watch out for that.

1013
00:52:20.80 --> 00:52:22.80
Kind of like a big cruise ship.

1014
00:52:22.80 --> 00:52:23.80
Kind of like a little speed boat.

1015
00:52:23.80 --> 00:52:24.80
Of course.

1016
00:52:24.80 --> 00:52:24.80
Of course.

1017
00:52:24.80 --> 00:52:24.80
Like this.

1018
00:52:24.80 --> 00:52:25.80
Of course.

1019
00:52:25.80 --> 00:52:27.80
Those things take miles to turn.

1020
00:52:27.80 --> 00:52:28.80
Miles.

1021
00:52:28.80 --> 00:52:31.80
Those big oil tankers, they take miles to stop.

1022
00:52:31.80 --> 00:52:32.80
Back to the book.

1023
00:52:32.80 --> 00:52:37.80
The excellence of their discipline made their small army sufficient to encounter all their enemies with success.

1024
00:52:37.80 --> 00:52:41.80
Now, this is something else I see a lot in business world.

1025
00:52:41.80 --> 00:52:48.80
And this is very common, right? You get the big, the big business, the big gorilla in the room or whatever.

1026
00:52:48.80 --> 00:52:50.80
And they can't pivot very quickly.

1027
00:52:50.80 --> 00:52:53.80
Well, then you get the smaller companies that are very agile.

1028
00:52:53.80 --> 00:52:55.80
And they start picking away at the big guy.

1029
00:52:55.80 --> 00:52:56.80
That's what he's talking about right here.

1030
00:52:56.80 --> 00:52:58.80
Like, just because you're small doesn't mean you can't.

1031
00:52:58.80 --> 00:53:00.80
You can't take a shot at the title.

1032
00:53:00.80 --> 00:53:02.80
You know, you could move quickly.

1033
00:53:02.80 --> 00:53:05.80
And if there's chaos going on, that's when you can adapt.

1034
00:53:05.80 --> 00:53:09.80
Now, are they advantageous to being the big company with lots of money and lots of people in your very stable?

1035
00:53:09.80 --> 00:53:10.80
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

1036
00:53:10.80 --> 00:53:13.80
So, and are there advantageous to being small?

1037
00:53:13.80 --> 00:53:19.80
Yes, there are the mistake that people on both sides make is they view themselves.

1038
00:53:19.80 --> 00:53:22.80
They don't understand what their strengths and weaknesses are.

1039
00:53:22.80 --> 00:53:25.80
And they don't understand the strengths and weaknesses of their opponents, right?

1040
00:53:25.80 --> 00:53:28.80
So they say, if there's someone that can move quicker than them, they go, don't worry about them.

1041
00:53:28.80 --> 00:53:29.80
We're bigger and more stable.

1042
00:53:29.80 --> 00:53:31.80
Well, those people are maneuvering on you.

1043
00:53:31.80 --> 00:53:31.80
Yeah.

1044
00:53:31.80 --> 00:53:33.80
And there's a little needles in your feet.

1045
00:53:33.80 --> 00:53:36.80
And eventually those little needles get infected and there's a problem.

1046
00:53:36.80 --> 00:53:36.80
Yeah.

1047
00:53:36.80 --> 00:53:41.80
You know, situation going on. So you have to constantly as a leader and again,

1048
00:53:41.80 --> 00:53:43.80
this is why leadership is important.

1049
00:53:43.80 --> 00:53:46.80
You have to, as a leader need to assess what's the strength of that group.

1050
00:53:46.80 --> 00:53:47.80
What's the weaknesses?

1051
00:53:47.80 --> 00:53:49.80
What are our strengths, right?

1052
00:53:49.80 --> 00:53:53.80
We keep hearing this again over and over again throughout all these ancient military leaders.

1053
00:53:53.80 --> 00:53:55.80
Know yourself. Know your opponent.

1054
00:53:55.80 --> 00:53:57.80
Know your strengths. Know your weaknesses.

1055
00:53:57.80 --> 00:53:58.80
For sure.

1056
00:53:58.80 --> 00:54:00.80
People fail to do that.

1057
00:54:00.80 --> 00:54:00.80
Yeah.

1058
00:54:00.80 --> 00:54:07.80
Problematic.

1059
00:54:07.80 --> 00:54:09.80
Here we go.

1060
00:54:09.80 --> 00:54:14.80
Famine makes greater havoc in an army than the enemy.

1061
00:54:14.80 --> 00:54:17.80
And is more terrible than the sword.

1062
00:54:17.80 --> 00:54:24.80
You know, every time we've read that in last couple of books, people talking about how it's better to starve your enemy.

1063
00:54:24.80 --> 00:54:31.80
Just makes me really, really thankful that there's abundant food in this country right now.

1064
00:54:31.80 --> 00:54:32.80
It really does.

1065
00:54:32.80 --> 00:54:38.80
I mean, I've never been starving and can you imagine starving to death?

1066
00:54:38.80 --> 00:54:41.80
It's got to be absolutely heinous.

1067
00:54:41.80 --> 00:54:42.80
Yeah.

1068
00:54:42.80 --> 00:54:47.80
Worst than the sword, according to the Gettius.

1069
00:54:47.80 --> 00:54:52.80
An army drawn together from different parts sometimes is disposed to mutate.

1070
00:54:52.80 --> 00:54:58.80
And the troops, though not inclined to fight, pretend to be angry at not being led against the enemy.

1071
00:54:58.80 --> 00:55:08.80
Such seditious dispositions, Prince Berley's, Prince Berley, show themselves in those who have lived in their quarters in idleness and a feminacy.

1072
00:55:08.80 --> 00:55:15.80
These men on a custom to the necessary fatigue of the field are disgusted at its severity.

1073
00:55:15.80 --> 00:55:21.80
Their ignorance of discipline makes them afraid of action and inspires them with insurgency.

1074
00:55:21.80 --> 00:55:32.80
So you let your, it's one of those, it's one of those dichotomies.

1075
00:55:32.80 --> 00:55:33.80
That's what it is.

1076
00:55:33.80 --> 00:55:37.80
If you let your people do whatever they want to pick it soft, then they start to rebel.

1077
00:55:37.80 --> 00:55:41.80
You want to talk about kids, you know, let your kids do whatever you want or whatever they want.

1078
00:55:41.80 --> 00:55:43.80
And see how that works out for you.

1079
00:55:43.80 --> 00:55:46.80
Lack of discipline to your kids, you can end up with some rebellious kids.

1080
00:55:46.80 --> 00:55:47.80
Yes.

1081
00:55:47.80 --> 00:55:51.80
Now, am I saying that you need to beat them like a dog?

1082
00:55:51.80 --> 00:55:53.80
Intestimition? No, I'm not saying that at all.

1083
00:55:53.80 --> 00:55:57.80
Because you know what that dog is? That dog's crazy. That dog will bite you at some point.

1084
00:55:57.80 --> 00:55:58.80
Yep. Right?

1085
00:55:58.80 --> 00:55:59.80
Or somebody else.

1086
00:55:59.80 --> 00:56:00.80
Or somebody else.

1087
00:56:00.80 --> 00:56:00.80
Yeah.

1088
00:56:00.80 --> 00:56:01.80
It's problematic.

1089
00:56:01.80 --> 00:56:04.80
So you have to find the balance between those two things.

1090
00:56:04.80 --> 00:56:09.80
He says there's several remedies for this evil.

1091
00:56:09.80 --> 00:56:16.80
Let them be constantly employed either in the field days or in the inspection of their arms.

1092
00:56:16.80 --> 00:56:19.80
They should not be allowed to be absent on furlough.

1093
00:56:19.80 --> 00:56:23.80
They should be frequently called by role and trained to be exact in observance of every signal.

1094
00:56:23.80 --> 00:56:27.80
Let them be exercised in the use of the bow and throwing missile weapons and stones.

1095
00:56:27.80 --> 00:56:29.80
Both with the hand and sling.

1096
00:56:29.80 --> 00:56:33.80
And then with the wooden stored sword at the post.

1097
00:56:33.80 --> 00:56:40.80
Let them be let all of this be continually repeated and let them be often kept under arms until they are tired.

1098
00:56:40.80 --> 00:56:45.80
Let them be exercised and running and leaping to facilitate the passing of ditches.

1099
00:56:45.80 --> 00:56:54.80
And if their quarters are near the sea or the river, let them all without exception be obliged in the summer to have the frequent practice of swimming.

1100
00:56:54.80 --> 00:56:57.80
Let them be accustomed to march.

1101
00:56:57.80 --> 00:57:08.80
March through thickets and closures and broken grounds to fell trees and to cut out timber to break ground and defend a post against their comrades who are in a deiver to dispossess them.

1102
00:57:08.80 --> 00:57:16.80
And in the encounter each party should use their shields to dislodge and bear down their antagonists.

1103
00:57:16.80 --> 00:57:24.80
All the different kinds of troops thus trained and exercised in their quarters will find themselves inspired.

1104
00:57:24.80 --> 00:57:31.80
With emulation for glory and eagerness for action when they come to take the field.

1105
00:57:31.80 --> 00:57:40.80
In short a soldier who has proper confidence in his own skill and strength entertains no thought of mutiny.

1106
00:57:40.80 --> 00:57:42.80
That's awesome.

1107
00:57:42.80 --> 00:57:45.80
Yeah, these guys were doing force on force training.

1108
00:57:45.80 --> 00:57:51.80
He's saying look, you're not going to use swords but you're going to go against each other with your shields and fight for it.

1109
00:57:51.80 --> 00:57:57.80
And this is a get I've answered that question a bunch of times where people, you know, how do you build morale in your team?

1110
00:57:57.80 --> 00:58:00.80
It's like make them train hard, make them work hard.

1111
00:58:00.80 --> 00:58:07.80
Now the real trick is to make them train hard, make them work hard but at the same time what you do is you give them ownership of that training.

1112
00:58:07.80 --> 00:58:09.80
So they're running the training.

1113
00:58:09.80 --> 00:58:16.80
They come up with the ideas and you just respect the hardcore training that they're doing and you do it with them.

1114
00:58:16.80 --> 00:58:18.80
You don't just impoth.

1115
00:58:18.80 --> 00:58:22.80
It's different than just imposing on the team like we're going to do this hardcore training.

1116
00:58:22.80 --> 00:58:26.80
That won't create a mutiny if you're not careful.

1117
00:58:26.80 --> 00:58:31.80
Especially if you're not out there doing it with them or if you don't explain why it's important.

1118
00:58:31.80 --> 00:58:33.80
I read this thing.

1119
00:58:33.80 --> 00:58:34.80
This is to kind of add to that.

1120
00:58:34.80 --> 00:58:36.80
Well, I think so anyway.

1121
00:58:36.80 --> 00:58:38.80
They think I'm a foul.

1122
00:58:38.80 --> 00:58:41.80
I forgot what it was but it said and allow for success.

1123
00:58:41.80 --> 00:58:46.80
So like when you train you know you train our train hard but allow for success.

1124
00:58:46.80 --> 00:58:49.80
For sure because if there's no success it's like morale goes down after a while.

1125
00:58:49.80 --> 00:58:50.80
Yeah, something like this.

1126
00:58:50.80 --> 00:58:51.80
For sure.

1127
00:58:51.80 --> 00:58:52.80
You can't just let it sit.

1128
00:58:52.80 --> 00:58:53.80
I just said you can't beat that dog.

1129
00:58:53.80 --> 00:58:54.80
Yeah, yeah.

1130
00:58:54.80 --> 00:58:57.80
You can't beat that dog.

1131
00:58:57.80 --> 00:59:03.28
It is much more to the credit of a general to form his troops to submission and no

1132
00:59:03.28 --> 00:59:10.80
obedience by habit and discipline than to be obliged to force them to their duty by the terror of punishment.

1133
00:59:10.80 --> 00:59:15.80
So he's making the reason I point that out is because it's making a clear,

1134
00:59:15.80 --> 00:59:20.80
a clear delineation between discipline and punishment.

1135
00:59:20.80 --> 00:59:23.80
Like discipline good punishment bad and he's saying those are two kind of opposite things.

1136
00:59:23.80 --> 00:59:25.80
So I think that's very important.

1137
00:59:25.80 --> 00:59:26.80
Things go to you.

1138
00:59:26.80 --> 00:59:31.80
And it's important to remember that you're treating your people good.

1139
00:59:31.80 --> 00:59:32.80
You're taking care of them.

1140
00:59:32.80 --> 00:59:33.80
That's what you're doing.

1141
00:59:33.80 --> 00:59:38.80
You don't necessarily take care of them by making their life soft.

1142
00:59:38.80 --> 00:59:42.80
You take care of them by making their life discipline and hard.

1143
00:59:42.80 --> 00:59:43.80
Not to beat them down.

1144
00:59:43.80 --> 00:59:44.80
There's a balance.

1145
00:59:44.80 --> 00:59:46.80
But that's what you got to find.

1146
00:59:46.80 --> 00:59:47.80
Yeah.

1147
00:59:47.80 --> 00:59:49.80
Back to the book.

1148
00:59:49.80 --> 00:59:52.80
It is essential to know the character of the enemy and the enemy.

1149
00:59:52.80 --> 00:59:56.80
And of their principal officers, whether they be raster, cautious,

1150
00:59:56.80 --> 01:00:04.80
Enterprising or timid, whether they fight on principle or from chance and whether the nations they have been engaged with were brave or cowardly.

1151
01:00:04.80 --> 01:00:07.80
So again, know your enemy.

1152
01:00:07.80 --> 01:00:17.80
You must by no means venture to lead and it resolute or dividend army to a general engagement for soldiers,

1153
01:00:17.80 --> 01:00:24.80
unused to fighting for a length of time must be considered in the same light as recruits.

1154
01:00:24.80 --> 01:00:28.80
So you say, and if you got people that haven't fought in a while and they're a little bit nervous,

1155
01:00:28.80 --> 01:00:31.80
then you got to figure that they're just like recruits.

1156
01:00:31.80 --> 01:00:35.80
You can't always trust them.

1157
01:00:35.80 --> 01:00:42.80
And then he talks about the general and says, if he finds himself in many respects superior to his adverts, adversary,

1158
01:00:42.80 --> 01:00:46.80
he must by no means defer bringing on the engagement.

1159
01:00:46.80 --> 01:00:50.80
So if you're in a better spot than the enemy or you can take them, go.

1160
01:00:50.80 --> 01:00:57.80
But if he knows himself inferior, he must avoid general actions and endeavor to succeed by surprises and strategies.

1161
01:00:57.80 --> 01:01:05.80
This one skillfully managed by good generals have often given them victory over enemies superior both in numbers and strength.

1162
01:01:05.80 --> 01:01:07.80
So this is common sense stuff.

1163
01:01:07.80 --> 01:01:10.80
If you think the enemy is better than you, don't fight him head on.

1164
01:01:10.80 --> 01:01:12.80
That's gorilla warfare.

1165
01:01:12.80 --> 01:01:15.80
If you think the enemy is bigger and stronger than you, you don't fight him head on.

1166
01:01:15.80 --> 01:01:26.80
All arts and trades, whatever are brought to perfection by continual practice.

1167
01:01:26.80 --> 01:01:36.80
How much more should this maximum true in inconsiderable matters be observed in affairs of importance?

1168
01:01:36.80 --> 01:01:42.80
And how much superior to all others is the art of war by which our liberties are preserved,

1169
01:01:42.80 --> 01:01:51.80
are dignity is perpetuated and the provinces and the whole empire itself exists.

1170
01:01:51.80 --> 01:01:53.80
You don't really like that.

1171
01:01:53.80 --> 01:01:55.80
You're suspect.

1172
01:01:55.80 --> 01:01:59.80
I think you like it enough for both of us.

1173
01:01:59.80 --> 01:02:00.80
Okay.

1174
01:02:00.80 --> 01:02:02.80
We'll take that.

1175
01:02:02.80 --> 01:02:04.80
It's true though.

1176
01:02:04.80 --> 01:02:06.80
Yeah, I actually can dig it.

1177
01:02:06.80 --> 01:02:08.80
Yeah, I mean, let's face the facts here.

1178
01:02:08.80 --> 01:02:16.80
If it wasn't for war, well, then you'd just be enslaved by someone.

1179
01:02:16.80 --> 01:02:20.80
I mean, I'd love for it to not be that, for that to not be the case.

1180
01:02:20.80 --> 01:02:23.80
But if it wasn't for war, you would just be enslaved by people.

1181
01:02:23.80 --> 01:02:27.80
Yeah, someone else, that was someone that believed in war, would you be this slave of them?

1182
01:02:27.80 --> 01:02:28.80
Yeah, that's I would work.

1183
01:02:28.80 --> 01:02:29.80
Yeah, you're sorry.

1184
01:02:29.80 --> 01:02:30.80
I'm sorry.

1185
01:02:30.80 --> 01:02:32.80
That's the nature of the world.

1186
01:02:32.80 --> 01:02:35.80
Yeah, no, you're actually right.

1187
01:02:35.80 --> 01:02:36.80
Yeah.

1188
01:02:36.80 --> 01:02:42.80
It's like, it's like the hope or wish that everyone was just perfect.

1189
01:02:42.80 --> 01:02:43.80
Of course, that'd be great.

1190
01:02:43.80 --> 01:02:46.80
Or actually in a way, would it be great though?

1191
01:02:46.80 --> 01:02:47.80
You know how like sure.

1192
01:02:47.80 --> 01:02:49.80
It'd be great if I got along everyone's saying goodbye on.

1193
01:02:49.80 --> 01:02:53.80
I don't know, but isn't isn't like stress or imbalance or whatever.

1194
01:02:53.80 --> 01:02:56.80
Isn't that the catalyst for any kind of progress of any kind?

1195
01:02:56.80 --> 01:02:59.80
What if everyone was just happy and it's just all good.

1196
01:02:59.80 --> 01:03:00.80
It's satisfied.

1197
01:03:00.80 --> 01:03:01.80
Yeah, right.

1198
01:03:01.80 --> 01:03:02.80
I don't know man.

1199
01:03:02.80 --> 01:03:03.80
I think we'd be in the stone.

1200
01:03:03.80 --> 01:03:04.80
I think it's bad.

1201
01:03:04.80 --> 01:03:05.80
Yeah, we probably would be.

1202
01:03:05.80 --> 01:03:12.80
But guess what, if we're in the Stone Age, and I see that you got a piece of whatever piece of meat or rock that I want, guess what?

1203
01:03:12.80 --> 01:03:13.80
I know.

1204
01:03:13.80 --> 01:03:13.80
I see that.

1205
01:03:13.80 --> 01:03:14.80
I see that.

1206
01:03:14.80 --> 01:03:15.80
But now you're talking reality.

1207
01:03:15.80 --> 01:03:15.80
Yeah.

1208
01:03:15.80 --> 01:03:16.80
Of course.

1209
01:03:16.80 --> 01:03:24.80
So, but so I mean, I guess the question is not to call off on too much of a tangent, but the question is, would you want it to be all peaceful all the time?

1210
01:03:24.80 --> 01:03:25.80
With no progress.

1211
01:03:25.80 --> 01:03:26.80
Would you want that?

1212
01:03:26.80 --> 01:03:29.80
Good theoretical question.

1213
01:03:29.80 --> 01:03:30.80
Kind of know, right?

1214
01:03:30.80 --> 01:03:34.80
I mean, because you're kind of thinking that you're kind of thinking, like doing graphic design.

1215
01:03:34.80 --> 01:03:35.80
I don't know.

1216
01:03:35.80 --> 01:03:36.80
I'm not confused.

1217
01:03:36.80 --> 01:03:37.80
I wouldn't exist if it wasn't for war.

1218
01:03:37.80 --> 01:03:38.80
Nope.

1219
01:03:38.80 --> 01:03:39.80
It would not.

1220
01:03:39.80 --> 01:03:40.80
There you go.

1221
01:03:40.80 --> 01:03:41.80
Point taken.

1222
01:03:41.80 --> 01:03:44.80
But even like, even like competition, right?

1223
01:03:44.80 --> 01:03:46.80
You know how it's like, yeah, competition is good.

1224
01:03:46.80 --> 01:03:47.80
Healthy competition is good.

1225
01:03:47.80 --> 01:03:48.80
It's good for you.

1226
01:03:48.80 --> 01:03:49.80
It makes you be, it doesn't feel like that.

1227
01:03:49.80 --> 01:03:52.80
Even when you're in the moment, it's like, let's say you're just dominating.

1228
01:03:52.80 --> 01:03:53.80
And whatever.

1229
01:03:53.80 --> 01:03:54.80
I don't know.

1230
01:03:54.80 --> 01:03:55.80
You play tennis.

1231
01:03:55.80 --> 01:03:56.80
I don't know.

1232
01:03:56.80 --> 01:03:57.80
And you're killing everyone.

1233
01:03:57.80 --> 01:03:58.80
And you're number one.

1234
01:03:58.80 --> 01:03:59.80
You're breaking world records.

1235
01:03:59.80 --> 01:04:00.80
You're money.

1236
01:04:00.80 --> 01:04:03.80
And then you kind of notice this new young hungry guy coming in.

1237
01:04:03.80 --> 01:04:05.80
You start breaking your some of your records.

1238
01:04:05.80 --> 01:04:07.80
You're like, you don't like that.

1239
01:04:07.80 --> 01:04:08.80
That makes you kind of mad.

1240
01:04:08.80 --> 01:04:11.80
You kind of wish that never happened.

1241
01:04:11.80 --> 01:04:15.80
But at the same time, that usually is a catalyst for you to start working harder.

1242
01:04:15.80 --> 01:04:17.80
You're preparing for that young.

1243
01:04:17.80 --> 01:04:18.80
I'm all about it.

1244
01:04:18.80 --> 01:04:19.80
Yeah.

1245
01:04:19.80 --> 01:04:23.80
But you're kind of kind of, and you like the head to head, you know, like you like that.

1246
01:04:23.80 --> 01:04:24.80
Yeah, like the competition.

1247
01:04:24.80 --> 01:04:25.80
Yeah.

1248
01:04:25.80 --> 01:04:26.80
You like directly, though.

1249
01:04:26.80 --> 01:04:31.80
You know, like when you say, when I think anyway, when when they say healthy competition is good,

1250
01:04:31.80 --> 01:04:33.80
it's the result of healthy competition is good.

1251
01:04:33.80 --> 01:04:35.80
You get the best product, right?

1252
01:04:35.80 --> 01:04:36.80
In the market or whatever.

1253
01:04:36.80 --> 01:04:37.80
And that's the result.

1254
01:04:37.80 --> 01:04:38.80
That's why it's good.

1255
01:04:38.80 --> 01:04:40.80
That's why it's kind of empirically good, ultimately.

1256
01:04:40.80 --> 01:04:41.80
I agree.

1257
01:04:41.80 --> 01:04:41.80
Sure.

1258
01:04:41.80 --> 01:04:43.80
It's not a perfect process.

1259
01:04:43.80 --> 01:04:44.80
You know.

1260
01:04:44.80 --> 01:04:46.80
You know, you're on the fence of my eye.

1261
01:04:46.80 --> 01:04:47.80
No.

1262
01:04:47.80 --> 01:04:51.80
But you, you like, like if I came up and you could tell, I was feeling good.

1263
01:04:51.80 --> 01:04:54.80
That would make you, that would make you nervous.

1264
01:04:54.80 --> 01:04:55.80
You'd be happy.

1265
01:04:55.80 --> 01:04:57.80
You'd be like, you like that head to head to head to head to head.

1266
01:04:57.80 --> 01:04:59.80
I felt you were feeling good about what?

1267
01:04:59.80 --> 01:05:00.80
Come on.

1268
01:05:00.80 --> 01:05:01.80
On the mat.

1269
01:05:01.80 --> 01:05:02.80
On the mats of justice.

1270
01:05:02.80 --> 01:05:02.80
Yeah.

1271
01:05:02.80 --> 01:05:04.80
If you come up to me, you're all excited.

1272
01:05:04.80 --> 01:05:05.80
Yeah.

1273
01:05:05.80 --> 01:05:07.80
Or even give me the echo Charles Scowl.

1274
01:05:07.80 --> 01:05:08.80
Yeah.

1275
01:05:08.80 --> 01:05:09.80
What is, okay.

1276
01:05:09.80 --> 01:05:10.80
You're open and more.

1277
01:05:10.80 --> 01:05:11.80
You're right.

1278
01:05:11.80 --> 01:05:13.80
Because I just played that through my mind.

1279
01:05:13.80 --> 01:05:13.80
Yeah.

1280
01:05:13.80 --> 01:05:15.80
When I see you like that, I'm like, oh, yeah.

1281
01:05:15.80 --> 01:05:16.80
It's even more on.

1282
01:05:16.80 --> 01:05:18.80
And so I'll even put it more accurately.

1283
01:05:18.80 --> 01:05:22.80
More extreme more understandable as far as what I think you're like.

1284
01:05:22.80 --> 01:05:24.80
So let's say we went enrolled and I tapped you out.

1285
01:05:24.80 --> 01:05:25.80
Right.

1286
01:05:25.80 --> 01:05:26.80
For the first time.

1287
01:05:26.80 --> 01:05:31.80
Sure.

1288
01:05:31.80 --> 01:05:31.80
You wouldn't like that specific thing.

1289
01:05:31.80 --> 01:05:35.80
But when we roll again, that's when you'd be at your happiest right there.

1290
01:05:35.80 --> 01:05:36.80
That's what I think.

1291
01:05:36.80 --> 01:05:37.80
Like I think most of us.

1292
01:05:37.80 --> 01:05:38.80
Yeah.

1293
01:05:38.80 --> 01:05:40.80
I mean, you want more of a challenge.

1294
01:05:40.80 --> 01:05:41.80
Yeah.

1295
01:05:41.80 --> 01:05:42.80
Like all of that.

1296
01:05:42.80 --> 01:05:43.80
It's really on now.

1297
01:05:43.80 --> 01:05:46.80
That moment to you is a very pleasurable moment.

1298
01:05:46.80 --> 01:05:47.80
It's what it seems like.

1299
01:05:47.80 --> 01:05:49.80
For some people like, from, I don't know.

1300
01:05:49.80 --> 01:05:51.80
I would even argue for like a lot of people like that.

1301
01:05:51.80 --> 01:05:54.80
I mean, maybe that's a good example, maybe not.

1302
01:05:54.80 --> 01:05:57.80
But that moment usually is a very stressful moment.

1303
01:05:57.80 --> 01:05:59.80
Like dang, now I got to deal with this now.

1304
01:05:59.80 --> 01:06:03.80
You know, and sure, it'll result in the way better stuff for sure.

1305
01:06:03.80 --> 01:06:05.80
But the moment is less embraced.

1306
01:06:05.80 --> 01:06:06.80
Yeah.

1307
01:06:06.80 --> 01:06:14.80
You know what I think people should pay attention to too is the thing that bothers people again.

1308
01:06:14.80 --> 01:06:15.80
Topically we've talked about before.

1309
01:06:15.80 --> 01:06:20.80
The thing that bothers people is the anticipation of the situation.

1310
01:06:20.80 --> 01:06:21.80
Right.

1311
01:06:21.80 --> 01:06:23.80
But most people like you, like, we were talking about

1312
01:06:23.80 --> 01:06:26.80
you making videos earlier.

1313
01:06:26.80 --> 01:06:28.80
When you know, like there's a monster coming in your probably like,

1314
01:06:28.80 --> 01:06:30.80
Oh, I got to do this video.

1315
01:06:30.80 --> 01:06:33.80
That I would imagine hangs over your head more than when you actually are,

1316
01:06:33.80 --> 01:06:35.80
All right, now you're doing the work and you're putting it together.

1317
01:06:35.80 --> 01:06:36.80
And it's getting dialed.

1318
01:06:36.80 --> 01:06:37.80
Yeah.

1319
01:06:37.80 --> 01:06:38.80
That's how I feel about things.

1320
01:06:38.80 --> 01:06:41.80
You know, I'll be like, there's something that I got to do.

1321
01:06:41.80 --> 01:06:43.80
And I'm like, I'm like, oh, you know what?

1322
01:06:43.80 --> 01:06:44.80
You do you attack that thing.

1323
01:06:44.80 --> 01:06:44.80
Yeah.

1324
01:06:44.80 --> 01:06:45.80
Jumping.

1325
01:06:45.80 --> 01:06:45.80
Yeah.

1326
01:06:45.80 --> 01:06:49.80
And now when you talk to me earlier about working out and like,

1327
01:06:49.80 --> 01:06:55.80
Hey, do you ever just call it what I will do, which is major weakness is,

1328
01:06:55.80 --> 01:06:57.80
I'll, I'll, I'll like, I'll like, wait.

1329
01:06:57.80 --> 01:06:59.80
I'll, I'll, I'll pace.

1330
01:06:59.80 --> 01:07:02.80
I've posted this on Twitter before like, yeah, I hemmed and hot.

1331
01:07:02.80 --> 01:07:05.80
I, I, I, you know, read the weights.

1332
01:07:05.80 --> 01:07:09.80
I vacuumed it and that's whatever I'm taking all kinds of reasons to not start.

1333
01:07:09.80 --> 01:07:10.80
I'm procrastinating it.

1334
01:07:10.80 --> 01:07:11.80
I'm going to do it.

1335
01:07:11.80 --> 01:07:13.80
I'm going to make myself do it.

1336
01:07:13.80 --> 01:07:16.80
But I'm just, I'm just like being such a baby.

1337
01:07:16.80 --> 01:07:19.80
Yeah, right.

1338
01:07:19.80 --> 01:07:20.80
Yeah, right.

1339
01:07:20.80 --> 01:07:21.80
I do that 200%.

1340
01:07:21.80 --> 01:07:21.80
Yeah.

1341
01:07:21.80 --> 01:07:22.80
It's like, I'm not talking hours.

1342
01:07:22.80 --> 01:07:23.80
Yeah.

1343
01:07:23.80 --> 01:07:24.80
But it's there.

1344
01:07:24.80 --> 01:07:27.80
But 20 minutes, you know, 20 minutes of like, you know what I better stretch out.

1345
01:07:27.80 --> 01:07:28.80
Yeah.

1346
01:07:28.80 --> 01:07:28.80
Yeah.

1347
01:07:28.80 --> 01:07:29.80
Let me see.

1348
01:07:29.80 --> 01:07:29.80
Yeah.

1349
01:07:29.80 --> 01:07:30.80
Exactly.

1350
01:07:30.80 --> 01:07:31.80
That's weak.

1351
01:07:31.80 --> 01:07:32.80
Good.

1352
01:07:32.80 --> 01:07:33.80
weak.

1353
01:07:33.80 --> 01:07:34.80
Do it.

1354
01:07:34.80 --> 01:07:34.80
Yeah.

1355
01:07:34.80 --> 01:07:35.80
Just do it.

1356
01:07:35.80 --> 01:07:36.80
That's the thing.

1357
01:07:36.80 --> 01:07:38.80
That you know what, you know what, that's one thing.

1358
01:07:38.80 --> 01:07:42.80
I'll tell you to little, this is a workout tip from Joccal Day.

1359
01:07:42.80 --> 01:07:43.80
All right.

1360
01:07:43.80 --> 01:07:45.80
You do, you put a stopwatch on stuff.

1361
01:07:45.80 --> 01:07:46.80
Right.

1362
01:07:46.80 --> 01:07:50.24
Like you, even when I'm doing something that's not really long, even when I'm doing something

1363
01:07:50.24 --> 01:07:52.80
that's not really focused on the time.

1364
01:07:52.80 --> 01:07:56.20
I at least put a stopwatch on it so that I just got to keep, you know, you just keep, it

1365
01:07:56.20 --> 01:07:57.80
just keeps it on pace, man.

1366
01:07:57.80 --> 01:07:58.80
Yeah.

1367
01:07:58.80 --> 01:08:03.56
Because otherwise, that feeling that I just talked about will, will start finding itself in between

1368
01:08:03.56 --> 01:08:04.56
sets.

1369
01:08:04.56 --> 01:08:05.56
Yeah.

1370
01:08:05.56 --> 01:08:06.56
Yeah.

1371
01:08:06.56 --> 01:08:07.56
That's not good.

1372
01:08:07.56 --> 01:08:08.56
Yeah.

1373
01:08:08.56 --> 01:08:12.08
All of this weird thing, I've mentioned this workout that I started long time.

1374
01:08:12.08 --> 01:08:14.24
Never really deviated that much for.

1375
01:08:14.24 --> 01:08:19.24
It has rest between sets as part of the workout, the time designated time designated time.

1376
01:08:19.24 --> 01:08:20.24
Designed time, yeah.

1377
01:08:20.24 --> 01:08:25.12
It was always, I don't think, man, I can not think of a time where it ever worked out

1378
01:08:25.12 --> 01:08:28.48
where the time between the sets was just like ambiguous or something.

1379
01:08:28.48 --> 01:08:30.80
It was always a specific time.

1380
01:08:30.80 --> 01:08:36.28
So that little procrastination thing would creep up between exercises or before my first

1381
01:08:36.28 --> 01:08:37.28
set.

1382
01:08:37.28 --> 01:08:38.28
You know what you were, I'm not feeling like.

1383
01:08:38.28 --> 01:08:40.60
And the first set is usually the heaviest for me to.

1384
01:08:40.60 --> 01:08:41.60
So I'm like, all right.

1385
01:08:41.60 --> 01:08:42.60
All right.

1386
01:08:42.60 --> 01:08:43.60
And that'll happen.

1387
01:08:43.60 --> 01:08:44.60
You're right though.

1388
01:08:44.60 --> 01:08:45.76
It's the watch on it.

1389
01:08:45.76 --> 01:08:52.38
I have this one workout that I do where I do like it's el-sit pull ups and then talk pull

1390
01:08:52.38 --> 01:08:55.68
ups and then dead hang pull ups and then kipping pull ups and then chin ups.

1391
01:08:55.68 --> 01:08:56.68
And then chin ups.

1392
01:08:56.68 --> 01:09:00.20
So it's like those five and you do as many as you can in each and then you then I do

1393
01:09:00.20 --> 01:09:01.60
something else and then I come back and do again.

1394
01:09:01.60 --> 01:09:03.84
I do like five rounds of that.

1395
01:09:03.84 --> 01:09:04.84
So they're like burnout sets.

1396
01:09:04.84 --> 01:09:05.84
Yep.

1397
01:09:05.84 --> 01:09:06.84
Each one's a normal set.

1398
01:09:06.84 --> 01:09:07.84
Okay.

1399
01:09:07.84 --> 01:09:11.60
And like the first time I did that, I got that was cool.

1400
01:09:11.60 --> 01:09:16.44
And so when the first time I did it, you know, it's kind of, let's just say motivated

1401
01:09:16.44 --> 01:09:17.44
to do it.

1402
01:09:17.44 --> 01:09:18.44
Yeah, yeah.

1403
01:09:18.44 --> 01:09:19.44
Yeah.

1404
01:09:19.44 --> 01:09:20.44
And this was years and years ago.

1405
01:09:20.44 --> 01:09:24.36
And then the next time I did it, it took me a really long time.

1406
01:09:24.36 --> 01:09:27.48
And I realized because I just was taking a long time between sets.

1407
01:09:27.48 --> 01:09:28.48
Yeah.

1408
01:09:28.48 --> 01:09:29.48
That's not the purpose of it.

1409
01:09:29.48 --> 01:09:31.32
So now I always put a stopwatch on that thing.

1410
01:09:31.32 --> 01:09:32.32
Yeah.

1411
01:09:32.32 --> 01:09:33.68
Keep the clock ticking.

1412
01:09:33.68 --> 01:09:34.68
Yeah.

1413
01:09:34.68 --> 01:09:35.68
And that's it.

1414
01:09:35.68 --> 01:09:37.40
And you feel it because you feel the clock ticking.

1415
01:09:37.40 --> 01:09:38.40
Yeah.

1416
01:09:38.40 --> 01:09:39.40
You know, you're like, oh my god.

1417
01:09:39.40 --> 01:09:40.40
I guess that would apply to everything.

1418
01:09:40.40 --> 01:09:41.40
Huh.

1419
01:09:41.40 --> 01:09:45.80
Like, if you, you know, that's why like when I write, I do a thousand words.

1420
01:09:45.80 --> 01:09:46.80
You know, why?

1421
01:09:46.80 --> 01:09:47.84
Because it gets thousand words done in hours.

1422
01:09:47.84 --> 01:09:51.36
Sometimes I'm, I'm wishing to see if I can get it in 50 minutes.

1423
01:09:51.36 --> 01:09:52.36
Wait wait.

1424
01:09:52.36 --> 01:09:55.04
So you will let say when you write, you boom, you set the clock.

1425
01:09:55.04 --> 01:09:56.04
You're telling your watch.

1426
01:09:56.04 --> 01:09:57.04
I don't set my watch.

1427
01:09:57.04 --> 01:09:58.04
Yeah, but you have it.

1428
01:09:58.04 --> 01:09:59.04
I look at it.

1429
01:09:59.04 --> 01:10:00.04
I look at it all.

1430
01:10:00.04 --> 01:10:01.32
It's, you know, eight, 48.

1431
01:10:01.32 --> 01:10:02.32
Okay.

1432
01:10:02.32 --> 01:10:03.32
948.

1433
01:10:03.32 --> 01:10:04.32
I'm going to be done.

1434
01:10:04.32 --> 01:10:05.32
Yeah.

1435
01:10:05.32 --> 01:10:06.32
I'm going to wrap this.

1436
01:10:06.32 --> 01:10:07.32
I got to do this.

1437
01:10:07.32 --> 01:10:09.20
Because that's even worse.

1438
01:10:09.20 --> 01:10:15.44
You set their poster to buy an excreion or you click on that little, on that little, internet

1439
01:10:15.44 --> 01:10:17.84
browser thing at the bottom.

1440
01:10:17.84 --> 01:10:18.84
Then there you go.

1441
01:10:18.84 --> 01:10:20.24
You're going on that slippery slope.

1442
01:10:20.24 --> 01:10:21.24
Don't do it.

1443
01:10:21.24 --> 01:10:22.24
Don't do it.

1444
01:10:22.24 --> 01:10:23.24
Don't do it.

1445
01:10:23.24 --> 01:10:24.24
Check.

1446
01:10:24.24 --> 01:10:29.72
Talking about the general a little bit more.

1447
01:10:29.72 --> 01:10:34.68
If therefore he finds his army composed of raw troops or if they have been long, long

1448
01:10:34.68 --> 01:10:38.92
been unacustomed to fighting, he must carefully study the strength, the spirit, the

1449
01:10:38.92 --> 01:10:46.40
manners of each particular legion and of each body of our Gilleseries cavalry and infantry.

1450
01:10:46.40 --> 01:10:48.16
He must know if possible.

1451
01:10:48.16 --> 01:10:49.16
This is good.

1452
01:10:49.16 --> 01:10:53.08
He must know if possible the naming capacity of every count tribune, subaltern and

1453
01:10:53.08 --> 01:10:55.000
soldier.

1454
01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:02.28
He must assume the most respectable, authority and maintain it by severity.

1455
01:11:02.28 --> 01:11:07.56
He must punish all military crimes with the greatest rigor of the laws.

1456
01:11:07.56 --> 01:11:09.40
So there's a dichotomy there.

1457
01:11:09.40 --> 01:11:14.04
He's saying you should know the name of every single person on your team.

1458
01:11:14.04 --> 01:11:23.08
At the same time, if they get online, you maintain by severity.

1459
01:11:23.08 --> 01:11:28.08
For troops that have never been an actioner of not for some time been used to such

1460
01:11:28.08 --> 01:11:33.16
spectacles, been used to such spectacles are greatly shocked at the sight of the wounded

1461
01:11:33.16 --> 01:11:34.96
and dying.

1462
01:11:34.96 --> 01:11:45.36
The impressions of fear they receive disposed them rather to fly than defy.

1463
01:11:45.36 --> 01:11:51.60
That's again to me is how to train people and get them used to what they're going to

1464
01:11:51.60 --> 01:11:53.56
be facing in the real world.

1465
01:11:53.56 --> 01:11:55.92
Always keep that in mind as a leader.

1466
01:11:55.92 --> 01:11:58.68
And I was about to say, I'm always keep that in mind as a trainer.

1467
01:11:58.68 --> 01:12:04.92
But as a leader, guess what you are, you're the trainer.

1468
01:12:04.92 --> 01:12:10.92
Having explained the less considerable branches of the art of war, the order of military

1469
01:12:10.92 --> 01:12:14.76
affairs naturally leads us to the general engagement.

1470
01:12:14.76 --> 01:12:16.08
So now he's up to this point.

1471
01:12:16.08 --> 01:12:19.72
He's only been talking about how to get ready for war.

1472
01:12:19.72 --> 01:12:25.88
This is a conjecture full of uncertainty and fatal to kingdoms and nations for indecision

1473
01:12:25.88 --> 01:12:32.68
in the decision of a pitched battle consists the fullness of victory.

1474
01:12:32.68 --> 01:12:37.08
troops must never be engaged in a general action immediately after a long march when the

1475
01:12:37.08 --> 01:12:39.36
men are fatigued and the horses tired.

1476
01:12:39.36 --> 01:12:43.88
The strength required for action is spent in the toil of the march.

1477
01:12:43.88 --> 01:12:49.000
What can a soldier do who charges went out of breath?

1478
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.24
Sure, everyone's going to hit me up.

1479
01:12:51.24 --> 01:12:56.68
So you need more rest.

1480
01:12:56.68 --> 01:13:00.08
And he goes on to a little, a little get after it right here.

1481
01:13:00.08 --> 01:13:04.08
The sentiments of the troops should be determined before battle.

1482
01:13:04.08 --> 01:13:08.48
It is necessary to know the sentiments of the soldiers on the day of the engagement.

1483
01:13:08.48 --> 01:13:12.48
Their confidence or apprehensions are easily discovered by their looks, their words, their

1484
01:13:12.48 --> 01:13:15.44
actions, and their motions.

1485
01:13:15.44 --> 01:13:20.76
No great dependence is to be placed on the eagerness of young soldiers for action for fighting

1486
01:13:20.76 --> 01:13:27.92
has something agreeable in the idea to those who are strangers to it.

1487
01:13:27.92 --> 01:13:31.68
They're saying the young soldiers that have been in war that are all fired up the fight don't

1488
01:13:31.68 --> 01:13:37.32
listen to them because there's some agreeable in the idea of fighting to be let haven't

1489
01:13:37.32 --> 01:13:38.32
done it before.

1490
01:13:38.32 --> 01:13:42.60
And then he says on the other hand, it would be wrong to hazard into an engagement if the

1491
01:13:42.60 --> 01:13:51.60
old experience soldiers testify a disclination, a disinclination to fight.

1492
01:13:51.60 --> 01:13:54.76
So if the old guys are like, hey, there's boss, not a good idea.

1493
01:13:54.76 --> 01:13:56.40
Pay attention.

1494
01:13:56.40 --> 01:14:02.16
A general, however, may encourage an animatist troops by proper exhortations and herangs,

1495
01:14:02.16 --> 01:14:08.40
especially if by his account of the approaching action he can persuade them into the belief

1496
01:14:08.40 --> 01:14:11.80
of an easy victory.

1497
01:14:11.80 --> 01:14:16.24
With this view, he should lay before them the cowardice or unskillfulness of their enemies

1498
01:14:16.24 --> 01:14:19.96
and remind them of any former advantages they may have gained over them.

1499
01:14:19.96 --> 01:14:25.52
He should employ every argument capable of exciting rage, hatred, and indignation against

1500
01:14:25.52 --> 01:14:28.12
the adversaries in the minds of his soldiers.

1501
01:14:28.12 --> 01:14:31.12
Now this is something I disagree with.

1502
01:14:31.12 --> 01:14:32.84
I disagree with this idea.

1503
01:14:32.84 --> 01:14:39.64
I disagree with the idea of telling the troops that it's going to be an easy victory, of

1504
01:14:39.64 --> 01:14:43.32
telling the troops that, hey, they're cowards.

1505
01:14:43.32 --> 01:14:45.56
I don't agree with that.

1506
01:14:45.56 --> 01:14:50.12
Because when you do that, there's a lot of things that can go bad.

1507
01:14:50.12 --> 01:14:55.48
Number one, when you go against the enemy and you face them and they start doing

1508
01:14:55.48 --> 01:14:58.08
good against you because they're more skilled than you expected.

1509
01:14:58.08 --> 01:14:59.08
That's a problem.

1510
01:14:59.08 --> 01:15:00.08
Yeah.

1511
01:15:00.08 --> 01:15:02.08
Yeah, I can jam up your morale.

1512
01:15:02.08 --> 01:15:04.84
Oh, that can jam up your morale really bad.

1513
01:15:04.84 --> 01:15:08.84
So I don't recommend ever disrespecting the enemy.

1514
01:15:08.84 --> 01:15:12.76
I recommend you give them, if not to mention, if you're this can be an easy victory.

1515
01:15:12.76 --> 01:15:14.12
What's your mindset going into it?

1516
01:15:14.12 --> 01:15:15.12
Yeah, yeah.

1517
01:15:15.12 --> 01:15:16.12
Cruising.

1518
01:15:16.12 --> 01:15:17.36
First of all, you're not training hard for it.

1519
01:15:17.36 --> 01:15:20.16
You think you're going to win a easy it's called, yeah, don't do that.

1520
01:15:20.16 --> 01:15:23.64
No, you respect the enemy.

1521
01:15:23.64 --> 01:15:26.96
I think the point that he may have been trying to make is I don't be afraid of the enemy.

1522
01:15:26.96 --> 01:15:27.96
I get that.

1523
01:15:27.96 --> 01:15:30.40
Not for me afraid of, but respect them.

1524
01:15:30.40 --> 01:15:31.40
Mm-hmm.

1525
01:15:31.40 --> 01:15:35.72
Didn't affect the great say something like that in last time, like something about

1526
01:15:35.72 --> 01:15:40.24
remind them of how lame they are or whatever.

1527
01:15:40.24 --> 01:15:47.96
He did say something like that and actually it just, the thing that he was saying, wow,

1528
01:15:47.96 --> 01:15:51.80
what was that he said?

1529
01:15:51.80 --> 01:15:57.28
He was saying, no, what he was saying was only talk about the enemy with total score.

1530
01:15:57.28 --> 01:15:58.28
Right.

1531
01:15:58.28 --> 01:15:59.28
That's what he was saying.

1532
01:15:59.28 --> 01:16:00.88
Only talk about the enemy with total score.

1533
01:16:00.88 --> 01:16:03.72
And actually he was also saying, like, you shouldn't even hate the enemy, but don't

1534
01:16:03.72 --> 01:16:05.52
let anyone know that you don't hate them this size.

1535
01:16:05.52 --> 01:16:06.52
Which was kind of embarrassing.

1536
01:16:06.52 --> 01:16:11.04
And he's saying the same thing like rage and hatred and indignation.

1537
01:16:11.04 --> 01:16:12.64
That's how you want them to be thinking of the enemy.

1538
01:16:12.64 --> 01:16:14.48
So they both agreed on that point.

1539
01:16:14.48 --> 01:16:19.20
But I disagree on the point of tell your men that this is going to be an easy fight,

1540
01:16:19.20 --> 01:16:20.72
because it's not going to be an easy fight.

1541
01:16:20.72 --> 01:16:21.72
Yeah.

1542
01:16:21.72 --> 01:16:24.20
Back to the book.

1543
01:16:24.20 --> 01:16:29.32
It is natural for men in general to be affected with some sensations of fear at the

1544
01:16:29.32 --> 01:16:30.84
beginning of an engagement.

1545
01:16:30.84 --> 01:16:38.52
But there are without a doubt some of a more tomorrow's disposition who are disordered

1546
01:16:38.52 --> 01:16:45.12
by the very site of the enemy to diminish these apprehensions before you venture on action,

1547
01:16:45.12 --> 01:16:50.60
draw up your army frequently in order of battle in some safe situation so that your men

1548
01:16:50.60 --> 01:16:54.12
may be accustomed to the site and appearance of the enemy.

1549
01:16:54.12 --> 01:16:58.84
When opportunity offers, they should be sent to fall upon them and endeavor to put them

1550
01:16:58.84 --> 01:17:03.04
to fight or kill some of their men.

1551
01:17:03.04 --> 01:17:08.20
Thus they will become acquainted with their customs, arms and horses and the objects with

1552
01:17:08.20 --> 01:17:16.32
which we are once familiarized are no longer capable of inspiring us with terror.

1553
01:17:16.32 --> 01:17:17.88
It's amazing how good you get it.

1554
01:17:17.88 --> 01:17:21.12
It's something like if you've seen it one time.

1555
01:17:21.12 --> 01:17:23.40
Just think about any situation.

1556
01:17:23.40 --> 01:17:30.40
Think if you scare someone which I enjoy scaring people.

1557
01:17:30.40 --> 01:17:34.36
But if you scare someone and then they come back in and you try to do the same thing, they're

1558
01:17:34.36 --> 01:17:35.36
not scared at all.

1559
01:17:35.36 --> 01:17:37.16
It doesn't work.

1560
01:17:37.16 --> 01:17:42.12
So that's what that's how you want to prepare your people.

1561
01:17:42.12 --> 01:17:46.60
You get them used to those seeing what they're going to see.

1562
01:17:46.60 --> 01:17:53.40
The generals are acutely aware that victory depends much on the nature of the field of battle.

1563
01:17:53.40 --> 01:17:59.24
When you intend, therefore, to engage, endeavor to draw the chief advantage from your situation,

1564
01:17:59.24 --> 01:18:02.92
the highest ground is reckoned the best.

1565
01:18:02.92 --> 01:18:12.04
Always take the high ground.

1566
01:18:12.04 --> 01:18:17.16
Talking about reserves, the method of having bodies of reserves in the rear of the enemy,

1567
01:18:17.16 --> 01:18:24.44
composed of choice infantry and cavalry, commanded by the super-numerary, lieutenant generals,

1568
01:18:24.44 --> 01:18:31.52
counts and tribunes is very judicious and of great consequence toward the gaining of a battle.

1569
01:18:31.52 --> 01:18:35.72
Some should be posted in the rear of the wings and some near the center to be ready to fly

1570
01:18:35.72 --> 01:18:40.04
immediately to the assistance of any part of the line which is hard pressed to prevent

1571
01:18:40.04 --> 01:18:42.28
its being pierced.

1572
01:18:42.28 --> 01:18:48.60
To supply the vacancies made therein during the action and thereby to keep up the courage

1573
01:18:48.60 --> 01:18:55.88
of their fellow soldiers and check the impetuosity of the enemy.

1574
01:18:55.88 --> 01:19:01.28
So as ever, reserves don't over extend yourself.

1575
01:19:01.28 --> 01:19:07.16
The post of the commander in chief is generally on the right between the cavalry and the infantry

1576
01:19:07.16 --> 01:19:14.28
from this place he can best direct the motions of the whole army and move elements with

1577
01:19:14.28 --> 01:19:16.92
the greatest of ease wherever he finds necessary.

1578
01:19:16.92 --> 01:19:22.36
It is also the most convenient spot to give his orders to both horse and foot and animate

1579
01:19:22.36 --> 01:19:25.48
them equally by his presence.

1580
01:19:25.48 --> 01:19:34.56
So position yourself in a good spot.

1581
01:19:34.56 --> 01:19:40.56
An able general never loses a favorable opportunity of surprising the enemy either when

1582
01:19:40.56 --> 01:19:46.68
tired on the march, divided in the passage of a river, embarrassed in a morassus, struggling

1583
01:19:46.68 --> 01:19:52.64
with the declavities of mountains, when dispersed over the country they think themselves

1584
01:19:52.64 --> 01:19:57.92
in security or are sleeping in their quarters.

1585
01:19:57.92 --> 01:20:02.68
So just take advantage of your enemy whenever they let their guard down.

1586
01:20:02.68 --> 01:20:07.56
In all these cases the adversaries are surprised and destroyed before they have time to put

1587
01:20:07.56 --> 01:20:10.76
themselves on their guard.

1588
01:20:10.76 --> 01:20:19.16
But if they are too cautious and you and give but if they are too cautious to give you

1589
01:20:19.16 --> 01:20:25.44
an opportunity of surprising or incinerating them you are then obliged to engage openly

1590
01:20:25.44 --> 01:20:26.92
in on equal terms.

1591
01:20:26.92 --> 01:20:31.44
So whenever you get the chance you suck or punch them.

1592
01:20:31.44 --> 01:20:32.44
Right?

1593
01:20:32.44 --> 01:20:33.44
Sure.

1594
01:20:33.44 --> 01:20:39.36
You know is that the is that am I encouraging you to grab and soccer punch people?

1595
01:20:39.36 --> 01:20:43.72
No, but if you're going to fight take advantage of the situation.

1596
01:20:43.72 --> 01:20:46.80
If you've already determined that the enemy you need to be fought you're going to do

1597
01:20:46.80 --> 01:20:49.84
everything you can to.

1598
01:20:49.84 --> 01:20:50.84
But isn't that?

1599
01:20:50.84 --> 01:20:53.000
If you think I just started to rash of soccer punches?

1600
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.56
No, I feel like you misused the expression.

1601
01:20:56.56 --> 01:20:57.56
That's what I think.

1602
01:20:57.56 --> 01:21:03.48
Because soccer punch is more of a waging of war or certain level of war when someone's

1603
01:21:03.48 --> 01:21:04.48
in the same thing.

1604
01:21:04.48 --> 01:21:05.76
These are already at war.

1605
01:21:05.76 --> 01:21:06.76
They're already at war.

1606
01:21:06.76 --> 01:21:08.48
So now it's like it's kind of.

1607
01:21:08.48 --> 01:21:11.96
So soccer punches the kind hey we're just going to go invade this country.

1608
01:21:11.96 --> 01:21:16.40
They have no idea that we're you know they don't know one of their citizens said something

1609
01:21:16.40 --> 01:21:18.96
bad about our president or something like that.

1610
01:21:18.96 --> 01:21:23.32
But if you guys are in war and they're sleeping or something like that oh no man that's

1611
01:21:23.32 --> 01:21:24.32
good.

1612
01:21:24.32 --> 01:21:25.32
I agree.

1613
01:21:25.32 --> 01:21:28.000
I agree no I actually agree with you very much.

1614
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.56
Very strongly I think you're correct.

1615
01:21:29.56 --> 01:21:30.56
Yeah.

1616
01:21:30.56 --> 01:21:32.84
In fact I don't think you should soccer punch anyone.

1617
01:21:32.84 --> 01:21:36.92
Yes I agree you shouldn't soccer punch someone.

1618
01:21:36.92 --> 01:21:43.08
But if you are at war with someone, yes then you try to get them at their least prepared

1619
01:21:43.08 --> 01:21:44.08
situation.

1620
01:21:44.08 --> 01:21:45.08
Yes agree.

1621
01:21:45.08 --> 01:21:46.08
1000%.

1622
01:21:46.08 --> 01:21:49.40
All right this is important.

1623
01:21:49.40 --> 01:21:55.64
The flight of an enemy should not be prevented but facilitated.

1624
01:21:55.64 --> 01:22:01.48
Generals unskilled in war think a victory incomplete unless the enemy are so straightened

1625
01:22:01.48 --> 01:22:10.16
in their ground or so entirely surrounded by numbers as today have no possibility of escape.

1626
01:22:10.16 --> 01:22:17.88
But in such situation where no hope remains fear itself will arm an enemy and despair

1627
01:22:17.88 --> 01:22:20.96
inspires courage as powerful.

1628
01:22:20.96 --> 01:22:26.16
I think about that fear itself will arm the enemy if you surround them completely.

1629
01:22:26.16 --> 01:22:33.44
When men find themselves, oh sorry, when men find they must inevitably perish they willingly

1630
01:22:33.44 --> 01:22:41.48
resolve to die with their comrades and with their arms in their hands.

1631
01:22:41.48 --> 01:22:48.28
The maximum that a golden bridge should be made for a flying enemy has much been commended

1632
01:22:48.28 --> 01:22:53.28
for when they have free room to escape they think of nothing but how to save themselves

1633
01:22:53.28 --> 01:22:55.96
by flights and the confusion.

1634
01:22:55.96 --> 01:22:59.28
Now you might think that you might think by that statement he say hey like you build

1635
01:22:59.28 --> 01:23:01.40
a golden bridge for them to get away.

1636
01:23:01.40 --> 01:23:07.000
You might think that that's sort of a merciful thing to do but check out this line

1637
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:14.56
and the confusion becoming general great numbers are cut to pieces.

1638
01:23:14.56 --> 01:23:18.36
The pursuers can be in no danger when the vanquished have thrown away their arms for

1639
01:23:18.36 --> 01:23:19.36
greater haste.

1640
01:23:19.36 --> 01:23:22.68
So in here guys are dropping their swords they see an escape they drop their swords and they

1641
01:23:22.68 --> 01:23:25.80
run for it but you got them you're waiting their form.

1642
01:23:25.80 --> 01:23:31.72
In this case the greater number of the flying enemy the greater the slaughter.

1643
01:23:31.72 --> 01:23:37.96
Those are of no signification where troops once thrown into consternation are equally

1644
01:23:37.96 --> 01:23:43.24
terrified at the sight of the enemy as their weapons.

1645
01:23:43.24 --> 01:23:46.52
So that's good advice.

1646
01:23:46.52 --> 01:23:50.24
This is something as well.

1647
01:23:50.24 --> 01:23:56.20
You know it's not the same thing but man when you when you're dealing with another

1648
01:23:56.20 --> 01:24:01.000
human being and let's say let's say you and I are talking about something and I know

1649
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.28
I'm right and I know you're wrong but you kind of planted yourself into it.

1650
01:24:04.28 --> 01:24:08.000
You kind of painted yourself into a corner I'll give you a little out.

1651
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.52
I don't want to do that to you.

1652
01:24:11.52 --> 01:24:13.52
I don't want to do that to be hard work with.

1653
01:24:13.52 --> 01:24:14.52
No.

1654
01:24:14.52 --> 01:24:15.52
It'll give you a little out.

1655
01:24:15.52 --> 01:24:17.96
Oh yeah it's probably the way it used to be but you know what hey it's a little

1656
01:24:17.96 --> 01:24:18.96
something.

1657
01:24:18.96 --> 01:24:21.24
We go like yeah yeah you know definitely I've done it before.

1658
01:24:21.24 --> 01:24:23.48
I call that school I'm not worked.

1659
01:24:23.48 --> 01:24:26.08
What do you think of this?

1660
01:24:26.08 --> 01:24:31.08
It's good.

1661
01:24:31.08 --> 01:24:35.88
It's a nice thing to do but it feels very smart.

1662
01:24:35.88 --> 01:24:37.24
The way it's very smart.

1663
01:24:37.24 --> 01:24:38.24
It's very smart.

1664
01:24:38.24 --> 01:24:40.24
Do you give people a little out?

1665
01:24:40.24 --> 01:24:44.44
I have to do that with I have to do that with my kids you know.

1666
01:24:44.44 --> 01:24:48.32
They're a little out because I'll paint themselves in a corner because their kids you know.

1667
01:24:48.32 --> 01:24:49.32
That's what they do.

1668
01:24:49.32 --> 01:24:50.60
They just ask what they do.

1669
01:24:50.60 --> 01:24:51.60
Yeah.

1670
01:24:51.60 --> 01:24:52.60
Yeah.

1671
01:24:52.60 --> 01:24:55.20
It's a one-year embarrass someone because that's kind of embarrassing.

1672
01:24:55.20 --> 01:24:58.84
Especially when you get into some argument where it turns into a meance you kind of

1673
01:24:58.84 --> 01:25:02.60
think that you realize you're wrong and you're like oh man I have to basically give them

1674
01:25:02.60 --> 01:25:06.12
a wow I got yeah get me give that out so we're kind of we're both winners.

1675
01:25:06.12 --> 01:25:16.56
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1676
01:25:16.56 --> 01:25:21.96
Back to the book in the first place your men must not imagine that you retire

1677
01:25:21.96 --> 01:25:29.40
to decline in action but believe you retreat an artist to draw the enemy in to a more

1678
01:25:29.40 --> 01:25:35.04
advantageous position for you where you may more easily defeat them in case they follow

1679
01:25:35.04 --> 01:25:36.68
you.

1680
01:25:36.68 --> 01:25:42.72
For troops you perceive their general disperse of success are prone to flight.

1681
01:25:42.72 --> 01:25:47.64
So what that saying is and I should have given this introduction before is that if you

1682
01:25:47.64 --> 01:25:52.60
feel like you have to retreat you don't say hey we're we're we're getting crushed here

1683
01:25:52.60 --> 01:25:56.40
and we're going to retreat what we say is hey we're going to bathe them we're going to move

1684
01:25:56.40 --> 01:26:01.56
back we're going to draw them in so then guys go okay I get it if you're just like

1685
01:26:01.56 --> 01:26:05.40
hey we're getting our ass is kicked and we need to get out of here you're going to lose

1686
01:26:05.40 --> 01:26:08.52
people going to run away but if you're like hey we're doing this maneuver we're going

1687
01:26:08.52 --> 01:26:11.36
to fade back a little bit we're going to set them up and you go oh cool I'm going

1688
01:26:11.36 --> 01:26:13.000
to get an opportunity for payback.

1689
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.56
Yeah yeah so that's a good point yeah very good point.

1690
01:26:16.56 --> 01:26:19.64
It seems like their mindset would still be in the fight in that case.

1691
01:26:19.64 --> 01:26:20.64
For sure.

1692
01:26:20.64 --> 01:26:21.64
And then versus.

1693
01:26:21.64 --> 01:26:27.04
Oh we're getting our out of here exactly you keep them in the fight exactly.

1694
01:26:27.04 --> 01:26:34.56
Now once people once the enemy is fleeing and you chase them you got to be careful

1695
01:26:34.56 --> 01:26:39.84
back to the book a rationing considerate pursuit exposes an army to the greatest danger

1696
01:26:39.84 --> 01:26:46.56
possible that of falling into ambush ambushes and the hands of the troops enemy troops

1697
01:26:46.56 --> 01:26:49.76
ready for their reception.

1698
01:26:49.76 --> 01:26:55.88
For as in the term temerity of an army is increased and their caution lessened by the

1699
01:26:55.88 --> 01:27:02.24
pursuit of a flying enemy this is most favorable opportunity for such snares so when you

1700
01:27:02.24 --> 01:27:06.44
get somebody running after you that's when you can catch them.

1701
01:27:06.44 --> 01:27:13.28
The greater the security the greater the danger troops went unprepared at their meals

1702
01:27:13.28 --> 01:27:18.28
fatigue after march when their horses are feeding and insured when they believe themselves

1703
01:27:18.28 --> 01:27:24.44
most security most secure are generally most liable to a surprise.

1704
01:27:24.44 --> 01:27:29.84
All risks of this sort are to be avoided carefully and all opportunities taken of distressing

1705
01:27:29.84 --> 01:27:34.28
the enemy by such methods.

1706
01:27:34.28 --> 01:27:40.08
So that mindset that people get like you just said when they're running away is one

1707
01:27:40.08 --> 01:27:43.76
thing but also when they think they just want they get the mindset of like oh we don't

1708
01:27:43.76 --> 01:27:46.84
need security anymore anymore right now.

1709
01:27:46.84 --> 01:27:50.60
We don't need it we're good.

1710
01:27:50.60 --> 01:27:54.04
There's that one little line.

1711
01:27:54.04 --> 01:27:57.60
The greater the security the greater the danger that that line right there doesn't

1712
01:27:57.60 --> 01:27:59.12
make any sense.

1713
01:27:59.12 --> 01:28:02.84
The greater the security the greater the danger what he's saying is when the the greater

1714
01:28:02.84 --> 01:28:09.84
the security is the greater the danger of being susceptible to letting your guard down.

1715
01:28:09.84 --> 01:28:15.52
Yeah like if you like the MMA situation they got the guy dead.

1716
01:28:15.52 --> 01:28:19.32
You're not sure fine right we talked about it but yeah you got him deeds days and they're

1717
01:28:19.32 --> 01:28:24.40
like well I'm gonna go in for the finish all crazy not like as cautious as maybe they

1718
01:28:24.40 --> 01:28:25.96
should be kind of that situation.

1719
01:28:25.96 --> 01:28:29.24
Yeah for sure he's talking about the greater the security so the better you feel.

1720
01:28:29.24 --> 01:28:30.24
Right this you're saying.

1721
01:28:30.24 --> 01:28:36.56
But I keep losing that line the greater the security the greater the danger the greater

1722
01:28:36.56 --> 01:28:38.24
the security the greater the danger that's what it is.

1723
01:28:38.24 --> 01:28:46.24
So when you're feeling secure watch it watch yourself resources in case of defeat.

1724
01:28:46.24 --> 01:28:50.68
If while one part of your army is victorious the other should be defeated you are by

1725
01:28:50.68 --> 01:28:57.36
no means to despair since even in this extremity the constancy and resolution of a general

1726
01:28:57.36 --> 01:29:01.60
may recover a complete victory.

1727
01:29:01.60 --> 01:29:04.68
So just because you take a little loss doesn't mean you're gonna lose completely yet

1728
01:29:04.68 --> 01:29:09.84
notwithstanding an entire defeat all possible remedies must be attempted since many generals

1729
01:29:09.84 --> 01:29:12.96
have been fortunate enough to repair such a loss.

1730
01:29:12.96 --> 01:29:15.24
So you can always come back.

1731
01:29:15.24 --> 01:29:20.68
And army after defeat has sometimes rallied returned on the enemy dispersed him by pursuing

1732
01:29:20.68 --> 01:29:25.60
in order and destroyed him without difficulty.

1733
01:29:25.60 --> 01:29:32.60
And more can men be in a more dangerous situation than when in the midst of joy after victory

1734
01:29:32.60 --> 01:29:41.04
their exaltation is suddenly converted into terror.

1735
01:29:41.04 --> 01:29:49.64
So same thing your joy is because you want and all of a sudden your the tables turn.

1736
01:29:49.64 --> 01:29:54.44
Whatever be the event the remains of the army must be immediately assembled reanimated

1737
01:29:54.44 --> 01:29:58.68
by suitable exhortations and furnished with fresh supplies of arms.

1738
01:29:58.68 --> 01:30:00.88
That's what you do.

1739
01:30:00.88 --> 01:30:03.72
When you get a good victory you're like all right reload that's what we're doing right

1740
01:30:03.72 --> 01:30:07.20
now.

1741
01:30:07.20 --> 01:30:16.20
And in this last section of the book he kind of just breaks down and sums up the rest of

1742
01:30:16.20 --> 01:30:18.72
the book that we just read.

1743
01:30:18.72 --> 01:30:26.52
So these are all pretty familiar most of them because we got covered most of them.

1744
01:30:26.52 --> 01:30:31.88
It is the nature of war that what is beneficial to you is detrimental to the enemy and

1745
01:30:31.88 --> 01:30:36.48
what is of service to him always hurts you.

1746
01:30:36.48 --> 01:30:39.32
That seems like common sense.

1747
01:30:39.32 --> 01:30:46.08
The more troops the more your troops have been accustomed to camp duties on frontier

1748
01:30:46.08 --> 01:30:51.24
stations and the more carefully they have been disciplined the less danger they will

1749
01:30:51.24 --> 01:30:56.88
be exposed to in the field.

1750
01:30:56.88 --> 01:31:01.16
Train them hard men must be sufficiently tried before they are let against the enemy.

1751
01:31:01.16 --> 01:31:02.16
Train them hard.

1752
01:31:02.16 --> 01:31:09.92
It is much better to overcome the enemy by famine, surprise or terror than my general actions.

1753
01:31:09.92 --> 01:31:16.92
From the latter instance fortune has often a greater share than valor.

1754
01:31:16.92 --> 01:31:21.52
I like the idea of overcoming the enemy just by terror.

1755
01:31:21.52 --> 01:31:25.20
Just I wish there was like a full chapter about that.

1756
01:31:25.20 --> 01:31:28.24
That's legit.

1757
01:31:28.24 --> 01:31:35.28
Those designs are best which the enemy are entirely ignorant of till the moment of execution.

1758
01:31:35.28 --> 01:31:45.92
The enemy in war is often more to be depended on than courage.

1759
01:31:45.92 --> 01:31:52.72
To debauch the enemy soldiers and encourage them when sincere in surrendering themselves

1760
01:31:52.72 --> 01:31:58.72
is of a special service for an adversary is more hurt by desertion than my slaughter.

1761
01:31:58.72 --> 01:32:04.20
So if you can get the enemy to come over to your side that's even worse to the enemy.

1762
01:32:04.20 --> 01:32:05.20
And when you're just killing them.

1763
01:32:05.20 --> 01:32:08.88
Because you think about when you're getting your friends killed you have some kind of

1764
01:32:08.88 --> 01:32:09.88
vengeance.

1765
01:32:09.88 --> 01:32:14.28
But if they just take your friends and they're like all in the back room having to have

1766
01:32:14.28 --> 01:32:15.28
them to blast a wine.

1767
01:32:15.28 --> 01:32:16.28
You know what?

1768
01:32:16.28 --> 01:32:22.48
I don't think that sounds better than the deal I got.

1769
01:32:22.48 --> 01:32:27.64
It is better to have several bodies of reserves than to extend yourself too much to the

1770
01:32:27.64 --> 01:32:28.64
front.

1771
01:32:28.64 --> 01:32:30.36
There you go.

1772
01:32:30.36 --> 01:32:37.68
A general is not easily overcome who can form a true judgment of his own and the enemy forces.

1773
01:32:37.68 --> 01:32:40.20
We've been hearing that once in Sunsu.

1774
01:32:40.20 --> 01:32:41.80
Art of war.

1775
01:32:41.80 --> 01:32:45.72
Valor is superior to numbers.

1776
01:32:45.72 --> 01:32:49.56
The nature of ground is often of more consequence than courage.

1777
01:32:49.56 --> 01:32:51.000
These guys talking about terrain.

1778
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000
That's what he's talking about.

1779
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.12
So everyone that's an military lesson this right now.

1780
01:32:54.12 --> 01:32:55.72
terrain terrain terrain.

1781
01:32:55.72 --> 01:32:59.08
Learn to read the terrain.

1782
01:32:59.08 --> 01:33:00.08
This is a good one.

1783
01:33:00.08 --> 01:33:03.08
Few men are born brave.

1784
01:33:03.08 --> 01:33:09.32
Many become so through care and force of discipline.

1785
01:33:09.32 --> 01:33:11.16
Great dichotomy there.

1786
01:33:11.16 --> 01:33:20.04
Care for your people and through force of discipline is what makes people brave.

1787
01:33:20.04 --> 01:33:30.56
The army is strengthened by labor and weakened by idleness.

1788
01:33:30.56 --> 01:33:33.28
Don't sit around.

1789
01:33:33.28 --> 01:33:34.60
Don't sit around.

1790
01:33:34.60 --> 01:33:36.76
Keep moving.

1791
01:33:36.76 --> 01:33:41.92
Troops are not to be led to battle unless confident of success.

1792
01:33:41.92 --> 01:33:50.68
Evoltean surprised throwing enemy into consternation but common incidents have no effect.

1793
01:33:50.68 --> 01:33:54.16
Learn new moves.

1794
01:33:54.16 --> 01:33:55.72
That's some advice I need to take.

1795
01:33:55.72 --> 01:33:57.48
I always do the same moves.

1796
01:33:57.48 --> 01:33:59.20
Not good.

1797
01:33:59.20 --> 01:34:07.24
He who rashly pursues a flying enemy with troops in disorder seems inclined to resign that victory

1798
01:34:07.24 --> 01:34:10.56
which he had before obtained.

1799
01:34:10.56 --> 01:34:15.56
So if you go pursuing the enemy when your troops aren't organized you're basically trying

1800
01:34:15.56 --> 01:34:17.76
to give away your victory.

1801
01:34:17.76 --> 01:34:21.08
So be careful when you pursue.

1802
01:34:21.08 --> 01:34:25.56
An army unsupplied with grain and other necessary provisions will be vanquished without

1803
01:34:25.56 --> 01:34:27.56
striking a blow.

1804
01:34:27.56 --> 01:34:29.56
I need to wind you finds.

1805
01:34:29.56 --> 01:34:33.36
I looked around and I've been looking for like a Roman soldier and they've found some

1806
01:34:33.36 --> 01:34:36.36
letters and stuff but these guys must have been hungry.

1807
01:34:36.36 --> 01:34:42.36
Talk about the time I'm hungry.

1808
01:34:42.36 --> 01:34:46.92
On finding the enemy has notice of your designs you must immediately alter your plan

1809
01:34:46.92 --> 01:34:48.28
of operations.

1810
01:34:48.28 --> 01:34:49.28
Check.

1811
01:34:49.28 --> 01:34:55.36
Consult with many on proper measures to be taken but communicate the plans you intend

1812
01:34:55.36 --> 01:35:01.68
to put an execution to few and only those of the most assured fidelity or rather trust

1813
01:35:01.68 --> 01:35:05.000
no one but yourself.

1814
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:10.44
Because interesting consult many people get some feedback from everyone.

1815
01:35:10.44 --> 01:35:18.56
Next, punishment and fear thereof are necessary to keep soldiers in order in quarters.

1816
01:35:18.56 --> 01:35:26.000
But in the field they are more influenced by hope and rewards.

1817
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.40
Oh, that caught me for you.

1818
01:35:29.40 --> 01:35:36.16
Good officers never engage in general actions unless induced by opportunity or obliged

1819
01:35:36.16 --> 01:35:39.56
by necessity.

1820
01:35:39.56 --> 01:35:48.000
To distress the enemy more by famine than the sword is the mark of consummate skill.

1821
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.64
And this is actually the last one.

1822
01:35:49.64 --> 01:35:53.72
Here dispositions for action must be carefully concealed from the enemy.

1823
01:35:53.72 --> 01:36:01.16
Unless they should counteract them and defeat your plans by proper experience.

1824
01:36:01.16 --> 01:36:05.24
So again I didn't cover all the maxims and the reason I didn't is because some of the

1825
01:36:05.24 --> 01:36:11.80
maxims that he talks about are legitimately ancient or tactical warfare.

1826
01:36:11.80 --> 01:36:15.72
But it's worth getting the books so you can read those and understand them.

1827
01:36:15.72 --> 01:36:23.40
And he kind of ends this book with a little note to the emperor of Rome at the time.

1828
01:36:23.40 --> 01:36:25.20
And this is how he wraps it up.

1829
01:36:25.20 --> 01:36:31.64
How glorious it is therefore for your majesty with all these qualifications to unite the

1830
01:36:31.64 --> 01:36:38.44
science of war and the art of conquest and to convince the world that by your conduct and

1831
01:36:38.44 --> 01:36:49.60
courage you are equally capable of performing the duties of the soldier and the general.

1832
01:36:49.60 --> 01:36:59.92
So he wraps up the book with that last dichotomy.

1833
01:36:59.92 --> 01:37:07.28
And I think that's one of the really one of the most important qualities for a leader to

1834
01:37:07.28 --> 01:37:08.92
have.

1835
01:37:08.92 --> 01:37:16.48
And one of the most important qualities to be able to balance and that is to be able to maintain

1836
01:37:16.48 --> 01:37:24.000
and lead from the highest position and at the same time never forget where you came from.

1837
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.56
You've heard that expression.

1838
01:37:25.56 --> 01:37:30.40
Don't forget where you came from that's what he's talking about.

1839
01:37:30.40 --> 01:37:39.16
And I think for every leader what that means is recognize that you still have more to learn.

1840
01:37:39.16 --> 01:37:47.96
But you can still grow, you can still try and get better and obviously that's what we're

1841
01:37:47.96 --> 01:37:55.24
doing here is trying to learn and trying to keep learning.

1842
01:37:55.24 --> 01:37:59.96
And I think that wraps this up.

1843
01:37:59.96 --> 01:38:05.76
Obviously we make this podcast so that we can learn and other people can learn if they want

1844
01:38:05.76 --> 01:38:13.68
to join in and if you learn anything and you want to give this podcast some support.

1845
01:38:13.68 --> 01:38:16.04
There's some great ways to do it.

1846
01:38:16.04 --> 01:38:23.20
And the goal to when you support the podcast is that you also support yourself.

1847
01:38:23.20 --> 01:38:27.56
That's the goal mutually supporting situation is what we're going for.

1848
01:38:27.56 --> 01:38:35.72
So first off we got our company up in Maine, up in New England, or in USA, informing

1849
01:38:35.72 --> 01:38:41.000
to Maine, 100% American-made products.

1850
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.40
It's a Gigi to company first and foremost, right?

1851
01:38:43.40 --> 01:38:44.88
That's the foundation.

1852
01:38:44.88 --> 01:38:51.000
These and rashguards, interestingly, guise one of the hardest things in the world to make

1853
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.12
from scratch.

1854
01:38:54.12 --> 01:38:56.12
And we make them here in America.

1855
01:38:56.12 --> 01:39:00.16
A lot of people think they're the best.

1856
01:39:00.16 --> 01:39:01.56
That's actually what I think.

1857
01:39:01.56 --> 01:39:02.56
Yeah.

1858
01:39:02.56 --> 01:39:06.48
So it depends on what you mean by the best.

1859
01:39:06.48 --> 01:39:15.52
So if you think that the ones that fit the most appropriately for Gigi to, then yeah, they're

1860
01:39:15.52 --> 01:39:18.64
going to use your Gigi to Gigi for Gigi to, then the best.

1861
01:39:18.64 --> 01:39:19.64
They're the best.

1862
01:39:19.64 --> 01:39:20.64
Conqueror.

1863
01:39:20.64 --> 01:39:26.84
If you want various different weeds, various different options that happen to me, Maine

1864
01:39:26.84 --> 01:39:35.76
to America, and various perfect blends for washing, drying, and time microbial stuff.

1865
01:39:35.76 --> 01:39:41.16
You know, when you see, do you remember the first time you saw Dragon Weave, like with

1866
01:39:41.16 --> 01:39:42.16
your own eyes?

1867
01:39:42.16 --> 01:39:44.28
Were you impressed?

1868
01:39:44.28 --> 01:39:46.28
I was.

1869
01:39:46.28 --> 01:39:50.92
Like it's legitimately, it's legitimately impressive.

1870
01:39:50.92 --> 01:39:54.32
I actually, this is one of the dumbest things I've ever thought of in my life.

1871
01:39:54.32 --> 01:39:55.32
All right, lay it on me.

1872
01:39:55.32 --> 01:39:57.60
Okay, first, saw Dragon Weave.

1873
01:39:57.60 --> 01:40:02.32
I thought to myself, it would be cool to get a legit, because you know, sometimes I

1874
01:40:02.32 --> 01:40:04.56
got to wear a suit, because I'm going to work with a couple of you.

1875
01:40:04.56 --> 01:40:08.32
I thought to myself, it would be cool to get a legitimate suit made out of this.

1876
01:40:08.32 --> 01:40:11.20
Dragon Weave, Dragon Weave, Dragon Weave, yeah.

1877
01:40:11.20 --> 01:40:12.20
I can see that.

1878
01:40:12.20 --> 01:40:15.56
It took me about 20 minutes before I realized I was an idiot.

1879
01:40:15.56 --> 01:40:17.88
But it's that cool looking.

1880
01:40:17.88 --> 01:40:18.88
Yeah.

1881
01:40:18.88 --> 01:40:22.36
So, and it's that practical.

1882
01:40:22.36 --> 01:40:23.36
That's the thing.

1883
01:40:23.36 --> 01:40:24.36
Yeah.

1884
01:40:24.36 --> 01:40:28.60
You can get Giz, Rashcards, OriginMain.com.

1885
01:40:28.60 --> 01:40:29.60
What else?

1886
01:40:29.60 --> 01:40:30.60
Joggers.

1887
01:40:30.60 --> 01:40:31.60
Well, it's okay.

1888
01:40:31.60 --> 01:40:34.96
So, you wanted the suit, sorry about you said it.

1889
01:40:34.96 --> 01:40:36.96
So, let's talk about it.

1890
01:40:36.96 --> 01:40:37.96
At least a little bit.

1891
01:40:37.96 --> 01:40:38.96
You said the suit.

1892
01:40:38.96 --> 01:40:39.96
The suit, dude.

1893
01:40:39.96 --> 01:40:43.20
You know, okay, you know, hey, Dragon Weave, suit.

1894
01:40:43.20 --> 01:40:44.20
Good, cool.

1895
01:40:44.20 --> 01:40:49.32
But, so they had, I've talked about this before, where my favorite shorts are Dragon Weave

1896
01:40:49.32 --> 01:40:50.32
shorts.

1897
01:40:50.32 --> 01:40:51.32
They were something.

1898
01:40:51.32 --> 01:40:52.32
They don't make them.

1899
01:40:52.32 --> 01:40:53.32
Sorry.

1900
01:40:53.32 --> 01:40:54.32
Oh, well.

1901
01:40:54.32 --> 01:40:58.000
So, I was talking to Pete about him and I was like, hey, you know, like, you should

1902
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.44
make the Jaggynly's.

1903
01:41:00.44 --> 01:41:03.64
And I forgot why, but, you know, not now.

1904
01:41:03.64 --> 01:41:10.16
There's other shorts, which are actually could prove more dope.

1905
01:41:10.16 --> 01:41:12.16
You see the buttons, like, you saw the buttons, right?

1906
01:41:12.16 --> 01:41:13.16
Like, for the shorts.

1907
01:41:13.16 --> 01:41:14.16
They're these buttons.

1908
01:41:14.16 --> 01:41:15.16
Right there, dope.

1909
01:41:15.16 --> 01:41:16.16
Anyway.

1910
01:41:16.16 --> 01:41:20.96
So, yeah, there's some joggerats, some shirts, and whatnot, some regular apparel, more athletic

1911
01:41:20.96 --> 01:41:23.56
wear, but super comfortable.

1912
01:41:23.56 --> 01:41:24.56
I'll tell you that.

1913
01:41:24.56 --> 01:41:30.96
As the self slash whatever pro claimed, kind of sort of comfort, I can say, come on.

1914
01:41:30.96 --> 01:41:34.44
So, we've come to the most comfortable stuff you're ever going to put on.

1915
01:41:34.44 --> 01:41:36.16
If you find anything more comfortable, let me know.

1916
01:41:36.16 --> 01:41:38.28
We'll see, compare apples to apples.

1917
01:41:38.28 --> 01:41:40.56
But yeah, some good stuff there.

1918
01:41:40.56 --> 01:41:42.68
Also some supplements.

1919
01:41:42.68 --> 01:41:44.40
And you know, speaking of the sub.

1920
01:41:44.40 --> 01:41:47.08
So, you know, you know who Dr. Rhonda Patrick is.

1921
01:41:47.08 --> 01:41:48.08
Yes.

1922
01:41:48.08 --> 01:41:49.08
She's been on Joe Rogan a couple of times.

1923
01:41:49.08 --> 01:41:50.08
Yeah.

1924
01:41:50.08 --> 01:41:50.92
Probably more not.

1925
01:41:50.92 --> 01:41:58.04
Anyways, she just tweeted out this thing, talking about curcumin.

1926
01:41:58.04 --> 01:42:00.68
And like, no kidding, double on.

1927
01:42:00.68 --> 01:42:05.64
I'm triple whatever tests UCLA.

1928
01:42:05.64 --> 01:42:08.60
Curcumin is awesome for you.

1929
01:42:08.60 --> 01:42:09.60
And.

1930
01:42:09.60 --> 01:42:11.08
But do you remember like what?

1931
01:42:11.08 --> 01:42:12.08
Yes.

1932
01:42:12.08 --> 01:42:13.84
You know, this is this is the thing.

1933
01:42:13.84 --> 01:42:14.84
It blew off.

1934
01:42:14.84 --> 01:42:17.28
The article actually blew off.

1935
01:42:17.28 --> 01:42:18.28
Wouldn't even blew off.

1936
01:42:18.28 --> 01:42:20.84
It was like, yeah, curcumin keeps down information.

1937
01:42:20.84 --> 01:42:22.000
Like that was no big deal.

1938
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Right.

1939
01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Right.

1940
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Actually, that's a huge deal.

1941
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.44
That's one of the reasons why it's in Joe and Warfare.

1942
01:42:26.44 --> 01:42:29.92
But then they did like a test.

1943
01:42:29.92 --> 01:42:36.08
And it improved memory and like cognitive reaction 28%.

1944
01:42:36.08 --> 01:42:37.68
This is in a lab.

1945
01:42:37.68 --> 01:42:44.20
And so, and then they referred to people in India that people in India who have a high level

1946
01:42:44.20 --> 01:42:47.08
of curcumin in their diets.

1947
01:42:47.08 --> 01:42:48.24
That's why Indian food looks yell.

1948
01:42:48.24 --> 01:42:51.92
Well, is because of that.

1949
01:42:51.92 --> 01:42:57.000
There's one not just like direct, but they're saying that's really interesting fact, right?

1950
01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Yeah.

1951
01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.92
So anyways, that's in there.

1952
01:42:59.92 --> 01:43:00.92
It's in joint warfare.

1953
01:43:00.92 --> 01:43:03.24
So there's more than just joint warfare.

1954
01:43:03.24 --> 01:43:04.24
Yeah.

1955
01:43:04.24 --> 01:43:05.64
The super krill, which is real oil.

1956
01:43:05.64 --> 01:43:11.56
As we all know by now, krill oil is pretty much the best source of omega.

1957
01:43:11.56 --> 01:43:12.88
Better than fish oil.

1958
01:43:12.88 --> 01:43:13.88
Yes.

1959
01:43:13.88 --> 01:43:15.36
And we all know fish oil is good.

1960
01:43:15.36 --> 01:43:18.24
So oil is even better super krill oil.

1961
01:43:18.24 --> 01:43:19.60
Even better than regular krill oil.

1962
01:43:19.60 --> 01:43:20.60
You know what?

1963
01:43:20.60 --> 01:43:23.04
The big difference between super krill oil and krill oil.

1964
01:43:23.04 --> 01:43:24.04
I do that.

1965
01:43:24.04 --> 01:43:25.04
Yeah, it's super.

1966
01:43:25.04 --> 01:43:32.28
No, but there's in some actual technical beneficial, super stuff.

1967
01:43:32.28 --> 01:43:34.28
And it's like zen, it's something.

1968
01:43:34.28 --> 01:43:35.28
But it's an antioxidant.

1969
01:43:35.28 --> 01:43:36.28
Absolutely.

1970
01:43:36.28 --> 01:43:37.28
It's not an antioxidant.

1971
01:43:37.28 --> 01:43:38.28
It's an antioxidant.

1972
01:43:38.28 --> 01:43:39.28
It's something.

1973
01:43:39.28 --> 01:43:40.28
Sorry.

1974
01:43:40.28 --> 01:43:41.28
I'm saying it wrong.

1975
01:43:41.28 --> 01:43:42.76
But it's an antioxidant, which is a big deal.

1976
01:43:42.76 --> 01:43:44.88
You know what rust is rust?

1977
01:43:44.88 --> 01:43:45.88
Yeah, the oxidation.

1978
01:43:45.88 --> 01:43:46.88
Yes.

1979
01:43:46.88 --> 01:43:48.80
All that is oxidation and metal.

1980
01:43:48.80 --> 01:43:51.84
So when you get some people, I did, well, I knew this for a long time.

1981
01:43:51.84 --> 01:43:53.88
But before I knew it, this is what I was going to say.

1982
01:43:53.88 --> 01:43:56.04
This is how my brain was as far as antioxidants go.

1983
01:43:56.04 --> 01:43:57.44
My mom was like, hey, antioxidants.

1984
01:43:57.44 --> 01:44:01.44
I'm like, wait, oxidant, oxidant, oxygen.

1985
01:44:01.44 --> 01:44:02.44
Oxygen is good.

1986
01:44:02.44 --> 01:44:04.48
Why is it antioxidant kind of thing?

1987
01:44:04.48 --> 01:44:06.44
I'm saying, no, it's not antioxidant.

1988
01:44:06.44 --> 01:44:12.96
Oxygen, antioxidant, meaning it fights oxidation, which is rust of your body.

1989
01:44:12.96 --> 01:44:16.16
So your body technically is kind of rusting.

1990
01:44:16.16 --> 01:44:18.32
You know, antioxidants keeps it from rusting.

1991
01:44:18.32 --> 01:44:19.96
So now that you, what do you get?

1992
01:44:19.96 --> 01:44:21.56
You get a loyal one here?

1993
01:44:21.56 --> 01:44:23.84
When you hear antioxidants, that's what you're hearing.

1994
01:44:23.84 --> 01:44:25.92
It's going to keep your body from rusting straight up.

1995
01:44:25.92 --> 01:44:26.92
So, real oil.

1996
01:44:26.92 --> 01:44:29.52
Omega-3's better uptake than fish oil.

1997
01:44:29.52 --> 01:44:31.44
And we need to make it many things.

1998
01:44:31.44 --> 01:44:32.68
Just know that you need them.

1999
01:44:32.68 --> 01:44:34.32
In this case, for your joints.

2000
01:44:34.32 --> 01:44:40.28
In other cases, for your eyeballs, your brain, your organs, all this stuff.

2001
01:44:40.28 --> 01:44:45.32
But know that just know that it has many uses plus antioxidants, boom, super-cruel oil.

2002
01:44:45.32 --> 01:44:47.40
That's what makes it super.

2003
01:44:47.40 --> 01:44:49.36
Then joint warfare, as we mentioned.

2004
01:44:49.36 --> 01:44:51.32
Yes, that's for your joint procurement.

2005
01:44:51.32 --> 01:44:52.32
Not just procurement.

2006
01:44:52.32 --> 01:44:53.32
No.

2007
01:44:53.32 --> 01:44:54.32
Glucos mean conjoining.

2008
01:44:54.32 --> 01:44:56.000
These are things for scary age.

2009
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.52
Man, I'm telling you, if you have bad joints, boom, joint warfare.

2010
01:44:59.52 --> 01:45:00.52
Boom.

2011
01:45:00.52 --> 01:45:02.80
Get some discipline too.

2012
01:45:02.80 --> 01:45:04.40
But yeah, by the way.

2013
01:45:04.40 --> 01:45:07.56
And so now, what we have as it turns out, according to Dr.

2014
01:45:07.56 --> 01:45:12.000
Rhonda Patrick, is that we have, so that all the things to each other.

2015
01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Yeah.

2016
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.48
So, joint warfare, krill oil is the joints.

2017
01:45:15.48 --> 01:45:21.28
But joint warfare also has cognitive enhancement, which as does the discipline.

2018
01:45:21.28 --> 01:45:23.28
So, there you go.

2019
01:45:23.28 --> 01:45:25.16
Discipline is like, what do you call it?

2020
01:45:25.16 --> 01:45:26.16
A powdered drink.

2021
01:45:26.16 --> 01:45:27.16
That's what it is, right?

2022
01:45:27.16 --> 01:45:28.16
Yeah, you know.

2023
01:45:28.16 --> 01:45:29.88
That's, I mean, I'll mix it up.

2024
01:45:29.88 --> 01:45:31.44
You put a little in your water bottle.

2025
01:45:31.44 --> 01:45:34.48
And then it gives you a little bit of natural muscle.

2026
01:45:34.48 --> 01:45:35.48
Yep.

2027
01:45:35.48 --> 01:45:38.48
So, you see that mental, mental, and very much.

2028
01:45:38.48 --> 01:45:43.88
Dave Berkson, me a text, he said, quote, best quote from the last podcast, Dave

2029
01:45:43.88 --> 01:45:47.32
Berkson, like a crackhead or something like that.

2030
01:45:47.32 --> 01:45:48.76
Sorry, Dave, no offense.

2031
01:45:48.76 --> 01:45:49.76
Yeah.

2032
01:45:49.76 --> 01:45:51.12
I know you're just like the discipline.

2033
01:45:51.12 --> 01:45:52.12
Yeah.

2034
01:45:52.12 --> 01:45:53.12
Amen.

2035
01:45:53.12 --> 01:45:57.24
Did you see someone posted a picture of like a guy with like cocaine, powder, all over

2036
01:45:57.24 --> 01:45:58.24
his face.

2037
01:45:58.24 --> 01:45:59.24
Yeah, the Dave should help.

2038
01:45:59.24 --> 01:46:00.24
Situation.

2039
01:46:00.24 --> 01:46:01.24
Yeah, that's a good thing.

2040
01:46:01.24 --> 01:46:02.24
Dave Berkson, yeah.

2041
01:46:02.24 --> 01:46:05.28
Maybe more than, at least, you've got nowhere to that discipline.

2042
01:46:05.28 --> 01:46:07.28
Yeah, well, well, so milk.

2043
01:46:07.28 --> 01:46:09.92
Okay, so that's a little bit of shifting gears.

2044
01:46:09.92 --> 01:46:10.92
Scenario.

2045
01:46:10.92 --> 01:46:13.60
In regards to supplements, milk.

2046
01:46:13.60 --> 01:46:14.60
Okay.

2047
01:46:14.60 --> 01:46:17.40
I'm gonna say the word protein, but I said this is from a city again, because to me,

2048
01:46:17.40 --> 01:46:18.40
it's appropriate.

2049
01:46:18.40 --> 01:46:21.40
I'm gonna say the word protein powder, but I'm not gonna say, hey, milk is a protein,

2050
01:46:21.40 --> 01:46:23.04
but I'm not gonna say that.

2051
01:46:23.04 --> 01:46:26.40
It's not appropriate, because it's different.

2052
01:46:26.40 --> 01:46:28.64
This is how it's different.

2053
01:46:28.64 --> 01:46:29.64
It's milk.

2054
01:46:29.64 --> 01:46:35.24
I just had a guy hit me up and he said, I don't drink protein powder.

2055
01:46:35.24 --> 01:46:37.84
But it sounds like this is just dessert.

2056
01:46:37.84 --> 01:46:38.84
Yeah.

2057
01:46:38.84 --> 01:46:40.32
And I hate to say it.

2058
01:46:40.32 --> 01:46:41.32
It's kind of true.

2059
01:46:41.32 --> 01:46:43.44
It kind of tastes like that too.

2060
01:46:43.44 --> 01:46:49.44
But dessert kind of has this kind of guilty kind of feel to it.

2061
01:46:49.44 --> 01:46:51.92
This is a guilt-free dessert.

2062
01:46:51.92 --> 01:46:52.92
Here's what I did though.

2063
01:46:52.92 --> 01:46:53.92
I was pushing though.

2064
01:46:53.92 --> 01:46:54.92
I know.

2065
01:46:54.92 --> 01:46:58.44
I was gonna kind of let you know, but I was like, hey, you know, just let me just

2066
01:46:58.44 --> 01:47:00.44
have it be funny for me.

2067
01:47:00.44 --> 01:47:04.48
So I'm thinking literally thinking of milk while I'm shopping.

2068
01:47:04.48 --> 01:47:05.48
Yeah.

2069
01:47:05.48 --> 01:47:08.16
So when I shop, you know, you wouldn't, I don't know how much you shop, but.

2070
01:47:08.16 --> 01:47:09.16
Zero.

2071
01:47:09.16 --> 01:47:10.16
Okay.

2072
01:47:10.16 --> 01:47:11.16
So I go in.

2073
01:47:11.16 --> 01:47:12.16
Next question.

2074
01:47:12.16 --> 01:47:13.16
I only go to, right?

2075
01:47:13.16 --> 01:47:14.16
I get red leaf lettuce.

2076
01:47:14.16 --> 01:47:16.72
I eat a lot of red leaf lettuce for whatever.

2077
01:47:16.72 --> 01:47:19.04
And I get milk.

2078
01:47:19.04 --> 01:47:21.52
But this time, I'm thinking of the milk.

2079
01:47:21.52 --> 01:47:22.52
I don't know why.

2080
01:47:22.52 --> 01:47:23.52
It was just in my head.

2081
01:47:23.52 --> 01:47:25.24
I wasn't gonna go drink some milk at that time.

2082
01:47:25.24 --> 01:47:26.80
It was just in my head for whatever.

2083
01:47:26.80 --> 01:47:28.80
And my eyes shifted to chocolate milk.

2084
01:47:28.80 --> 01:47:32.68
So I'm like, hey, what if I mix the chocolate milk with the milk?

2085
01:47:32.68 --> 01:47:33.68
I know, right?

2086
01:47:33.68 --> 01:47:34.68
It might be too much.

2087
01:47:34.68 --> 01:47:35.68
Did you do it?

2088
01:47:35.68 --> 01:47:36.68
No, I didn't do it.

2089
01:47:36.68 --> 01:47:37.68
Yeah, you don't need to.

2090
01:47:37.68 --> 01:47:40.60
Then again, why would I knock it for a try?

2091
01:47:40.60 --> 01:47:44.92
Because what if I discover something, seems same.

2092
01:47:44.92 --> 01:47:45.92
I didn't do it yet.

2093
01:47:45.92 --> 01:47:46.92
I'll report back.

2094
01:47:46.92 --> 01:47:51.60
But nonetheless, it is like a dessert, but it's one of those beneficial desserts.

2095
01:47:51.60 --> 01:47:52.92
Yeah, that's like a dark chocolate.

2096
01:47:52.92 --> 01:47:55.24
Like, you know, you know, consider dark chocolate.

2097
01:47:55.24 --> 01:47:56.24
Right.

2098
01:47:56.24 --> 01:47:59.24
I mean, it's a certain percentage of something where it's like good for you.

2099
01:47:59.24 --> 01:48:00.24
Yeah.

2100
01:48:00.24 --> 01:48:01.24
Got a drink of milk.

2101
01:48:01.24 --> 01:48:02.24
Like that.

2102
01:48:02.24 --> 01:48:03.24
It's like a big milkshake.

2103
01:48:03.24 --> 01:48:04.24
But it's egg in there.

2104
01:48:04.24 --> 01:48:05.24
You really want to get milk.

2105
01:48:05.24 --> 01:48:10.32
Well, we'll have some milk for sure at the immersion camp.

2106
01:48:10.32 --> 01:48:14.20
Which is, by the way, all this 26th, that's what it is.

2107
01:48:14.20 --> 01:48:15.64
Last year, we didn't have milk.

2108
01:48:15.64 --> 01:48:17.96
And then, milk wasn't even invented yet.

2109
01:48:17.96 --> 01:48:19.24
It was like straight up didn't exist.

2110
01:48:19.24 --> 01:48:20.24
It didn't exist.

2111
01:48:20.24 --> 01:48:24.32
It was like then all the sudden you cracked an atom open.

2112
01:48:24.32 --> 01:48:27.28
And they had to add milk to the periodic table.

2113
01:48:27.28 --> 01:48:28.28
That just happened.

2114
01:48:28.28 --> 01:48:29.28
Last year, I had to drink.

2115
01:48:29.28 --> 01:48:32.64
I just drank in the chocolate milk because they had it at the camp.

2116
01:48:32.64 --> 01:48:33.64
All right.

2117
01:48:33.64 --> 01:48:34.64
Yeah.

2118
01:48:34.64 --> 01:48:36.84
Like the old school cafeteria chocolate milk.

2119
01:48:36.84 --> 01:48:38.56
Just, it's just, it's just, it's just horrible.

2120
01:48:38.56 --> 01:48:39.56
You don't like it?

2121
01:48:39.56 --> 01:48:40.56
No.

2122
01:48:40.56 --> 01:48:42.72
I mean, I think I'm going to think of the experience because that's what it had.

2123
01:48:42.72 --> 01:48:43.72
It's not good.

2124
01:48:43.72 --> 01:48:44.72
It's not good.

2125
01:48:44.72 --> 01:48:46.32
So, yeah, immersion camp.

2126
01:48:46.32 --> 01:48:52.88
August 26th, in September 2nd, that's the last day about those two sessions in there.

2127
01:48:52.88 --> 01:48:56.24
I would say, you know, I can't speak for anyone else.

2128
01:48:56.24 --> 01:48:57.80
I would say, yeah, good of both.

2129
01:48:57.80 --> 01:49:00.20
That's good, but you know, good of one, good of two, whatever.

2130
01:49:00.20 --> 01:49:05.16
For those that are wondering, and I, this isn't confirmed yet, but we pretty pretty much

2131
01:49:05.16 --> 01:49:07.16
had the talk.

2132
01:49:07.16 --> 01:49:10.12
Pete, me, and be little.

2133
01:49:10.12 --> 01:49:21.40
And the conversation is looking like morning, ghee afternoon, no ghee evening, which

2134
01:49:21.40 --> 01:49:22.40
ever choice.

2135
01:49:22.40 --> 01:49:23.40
Yeah.

2136
01:49:23.40 --> 01:49:24.60
That's like a dream, isn't it?

2137
01:49:24.60 --> 01:49:25.88
I think so too.

2138
01:49:25.88 --> 01:49:30.32
And I don't have any complaints from the last one.

2139
01:49:30.32 --> 01:49:31.32
Yeah.

2140
01:49:31.32 --> 01:49:33.52
Literally, I have no complaints.

2141
01:49:33.52 --> 01:49:39.24
But I do remember thinking, if there was some no ghee mixed in here, this would really,

2142
01:49:39.24 --> 01:49:41.52
this would make me kind of not really want to leave.

2143
01:49:41.52 --> 01:49:42.52
The ever.

2144
01:49:42.52 --> 01:49:43.52
Yeah.

2145
01:49:43.52 --> 01:49:44.52
This is worth pointing out.

2146
01:49:44.52 --> 01:49:51.96
This is the kind of thing that I, you ever think about like people that are OCD.

2147
01:49:51.96 --> 01:49:52.96
Yes.

2148
01:49:52.96 --> 01:49:53.96
I think about that all the time.

2149
01:49:53.96 --> 01:49:54.96
Right.

2150
01:49:54.96 --> 01:49:58.20
And I'm both of, so sometimes I have a little bit of that.

2151
01:49:58.20 --> 01:50:02.72
But one of them is like, I want things to be squared away.

2152
01:50:02.72 --> 01:50:03.72
Right.

2153
01:50:03.72 --> 01:50:07.04
And so when I was going to the camp, I was kind of like, how is this whole laundry thing

2154
01:50:07.04 --> 01:50:08.04
that I work?

2155
01:50:08.04 --> 01:50:09.04
Like what's going to happen?

2156
01:50:09.04 --> 01:50:10.04
This was before.

2157
01:50:10.04 --> 01:50:11.04
Yeah.

2158
01:50:11.04 --> 01:50:12.04
Okay.

2159
01:50:12.04 --> 01:50:14.20
Well, the thing is, just to let everyone know, if you come to camp, they do laundry.

2160
01:50:14.20 --> 01:50:15.20
There's like a laundry service.

2161
01:50:15.20 --> 01:50:20.80
They pick it up and they wash our clothes and then they bring back in all your clothes,

2162
01:50:20.80 --> 01:50:21.80
nice and clean.

2163
01:50:21.80 --> 01:50:22.80
And that's a huge deal.

2164
01:50:22.80 --> 01:50:25.88
So you think you could basically get away with two geese?

2165
01:50:25.88 --> 01:50:26.88
Yes.

2166
01:50:26.88 --> 01:50:27.88
Two geese.

2167
01:50:27.88 --> 01:50:29.12
Well, maybe three.

2168
01:50:29.12 --> 01:50:30.12
All right.

2169
01:50:30.12 --> 01:50:31.12
Yeah.

2170
01:50:31.12 --> 01:50:32.12
I would say that way.

2171
01:50:32.12 --> 01:50:33.12
I only had two.

2172
01:50:33.12 --> 01:50:34.12
Probably three geese.

2173
01:50:34.12 --> 01:50:35.12
I didn't bring any geese.

2174
01:50:35.12 --> 01:50:36.12
I got an origin one.

2175
01:50:36.12 --> 01:50:37.12
Oh, yeah.

2176
01:50:37.12 --> 01:50:38.12
I was going to get there.

2177
01:50:38.12 --> 01:50:39.12
Yeah.

2178
01:50:39.12 --> 01:50:40.68
I'm saying to rotate them through properly.

2179
01:50:40.68 --> 01:50:42.04
But they're pretty fast on its turnaround.

2180
01:50:42.04 --> 01:50:43.12
Anyways, that's a deal.

2181
01:50:43.12 --> 01:50:45.64
But that's a, that's a, that's kind of a big deal.

2182
01:50:45.64 --> 01:50:46.64
The laundry is a case.

2183
01:50:46.64 --> 01:50:49.12
Because this is a difference between, hey, there's a laundry service.

2184
01:50:49.12 --> 01:50:52.68
Um, well, across camp to laundry mat and go handle your business.

2185
01:50:52.68 --> 01:50:56.16
Well, I actually, the camp is at a different same lake, echo lake.

2186
01:50:56.16 --> 01:50:57.68
But it's a different lake.

2187
01:50:57.68 --> 01:51:00.84
But I don't know what the exact laundry service, I think it's going to be the same

2188
01:51:00.84 --> 01:51:03.44
exact thing though, because the service didn't come from camp last time.

2189
01:51:03.44 --> 01:51:05.28
It's somebody that does laundry for geese.

2190
01:51:05.28 --> 01:51:06.28
Yeah.

2191
01:51:06.28 --> 01:51:07.28
Makes it.

2192
01:51:07.28 --> 01:51:08.84
There should be people in the world that just do ge laundry.

2193
01:51:08.84 --> 01:51:09.84
Just ge laundry.

2194
01:51:09.84 --> 01:51:10.84
Just.

2195
01:51:10.84 --> 01:51:11.84
Yeah.

2196
01:51:11.84 --> 01:51:12.84
They come in grab it though.

2197
01:51:12.84 --> 01:51:14.12
They're not going to do it like room service.

2198
01:51:14.12 --> 01:51:15.12
Yeah.

2199
01:51:15.12 --> 01:51:16.12
Really, it's huge to do.

2200
01:51:16.12 --> 01:51:17.84
I think it's a very convenient, great, nice.

2201
01:51:17.84 --> 01:51:24.28
Yeah, emergency camp, August 23rd, August 26th through September 2nd, 2 sessions.

2202
01:51:24.28 --> 01:51:25.28
I'm going to be there.

2203
01:51:25.28 --> 01:51:27.12
Jocco is going to be there rolling.

2204
01:51:27.12 --> 01:51:28.12
Yeah.

2205
01:51:28.12 --> 01:51:33.56
Rolling to fulfill your curiosity of how it is to roll with Jocco.

2206
01:51:33.56 --> 01:51:39.16
Um, I'm not going to say it'll be a good time rolling with Jocco.

2207
01:51:39.16 --> 01:51:40.56
I'm not going to say that much down.

2208
01:51:40.56 --> 01:51:44.28
My, you might get left down as far as pleasurable experiences go.

2209
01:51:44.28 --> 01:51:45.28
No, no, no, no.

2210
01:51:45.28 --> 01:51:48.12
Yeah, it might be everyone thinks all he's got to be so unbelievable.

2211
01:51:48.12 --> 01:51:50.32
No, it's like I'm not that good at gejitsu.

2212
01:51:50.32 --> 01:51:51.88
Yeah, I wasn't really thinking that.

2213
01:51:51.88 --> 01:51:57.28
I was thinking more, um, oh, yeah, it'll be fun and pleasurable.

2214
01:51:57.28 --> 01:52:03.28
Meanwhile, it'll be like 90% painful and then like 5% in mercy.

2215
01:52:03.28 --> 01:52:06.56
And, you know, there's other negative emotions.

2216
01:52:06.56 --> 01:52:08.40
But yeah, you can, you know, whatever.

2217
01:52:08.40 --> 01:52:11.12
If you wonder about that kind of stuff, I don't know, maybe you don't.

2218
01:52:11.12 --> 01:52:13.72
But yeah, that's in origin.

2219
01:52:13.72 --> 01:52:17.08
Also, we have a store actually.

2220
01:52:17.08 --> 01:52:21.68
Choco has a store and it's called Choco store.

2221
01:52:21.68 --> 01:52:23.16
Who made that name up?

2222
01:52:23.16 --> 01:52:24.16
I did.

2223
01:52:24.16 --> 01:52:25.68
Keep it in it simple.

2224
01:52:25.68 --> 01:52:29.48
Anyway, this is where you can get the rash guards that we make.

2225
01:52:29.48 --> 01:52:30.48
Get after it.

2226
01:52:30.48 --> 01:52:32.48
We'll trooper rash guards.

2227
01:52:32.48 --> 01:52:33.88
War your kid rash guards too.

2228
01:52:33.88 --> 01:52:39.20
By the way, if we're youth or your kids getting into gejitsu boom, and for surfing, and

2229
01:52:39.20 --> 01:52:42.72
for whatever, running, cycling, all that stuff.

2230
01:52:42.72 --> 01:52:45.32
And, uh, what other rash guards are there?

2231
01:52:45.32 --> 01:52:47.32
I'm just, to make sure.

2232
01:52:47.32 --> 01:52:48.32
I'm just, to make sure.

2233
01:52:48.32 --> 01:52:50.88
Yeah, I'm just gonna get some rash guards.

2234
01:52:50.88 --> 01:52:51.88
That's what I'm gonna make.

2235
01:52:51.88 --> 01:52:52.88
Stand by the get.

2236
01:52:52.88 --> 01:52:53.88
Sure.

2237
01:52:53.88 --> 01:52:57.40
I was gonna make a good rash guard, but then I thought, hey, what's the message

2238
01:52:57.40 --> 01:52:58.40
of good?

2239
01:52:58.40 --> 01:53:02.64
Is it a stand by to get some too close to get after it?

2240
01:53:02.64 --> 01:53:03.84
No, okay.

2241
01:53:03.84 --> 01:53:08.08
Because stand by the get some is when you're standing by the get some.

2242
01:53:08.08 --> 01:53:11.36
Getting after it is when you're actually getting after it.

2243
01:53:11.36 --> 01:53:15.04
So when you're standing by or you're getting after it's two different things completely,

2244
01:53:15.04 --> 01:53:16.84
back to the good rash guard, it's important.

2245
01:53:16.84 --> 01:53:21.76
I think as far as the layers go, okay, good is like when something quantum quote

2246
01:53:21.76 --> 01:53:22.76
bad happens.

2247
01:53:22.76 --> 01:53:23.76
Mm-hmm.

2248
01:53:23.76 --> 01:53:25.16
It's always something good to come from.

2249
01:53:25.16 --> 01:53:27.68
So what you said, it's a direct quote.

2250
01:53:27.68 --> 01:53:33.20
So you can't make and put on a rash guard that's based on something bad happening

2251
01:53:33.20 --> 01:53:36.04
as far as losing goes or something like that, right?

2252
01:53:36.04 --> 01:53:37.04
Okay.

2253
01:53:37.04 --> 01:53:38.32
I guess you could technically.

2254
01:53:38.32 --> 01:53:39.32
If it looked dope.

2255
01:53:39.32 --> 01:53:40.32
I don't know.

2256
01:53:40.32 --> 01:53:42.92
Do you still have any way back to the T-shirts?

2257
01:53:42.92 --> 01:53:44.24
There's some coins on there, right?

2258
01:53:44.24 --> 01:53:47.24
Yeah, just put that deaf core on the T-shirt.

2259
01:53:47.24 --> 01:53:48.24
Deaf.

2260
01:53:48.24 --> 01:53:49.24
Yeah.

2261
01:53:49.24 --> 01:53:50.24
Good idea.

2262
01:53:50.24 --> 01:53:51.88
I think you're right about that.

2263
01:53:51.88 --> 01:53:54.12
Oh, hats on there as well.

2264
01:53:54.12 --> 01:53:55.60
Two kinds of hats as a random.

2265
01:53:55.60 --> 01:53:56.92
Actually three technically.

2266
01:53:56.92 --> 01:53:58.60
Three types of head gear.

2267
01:53:58.60 --> 01:53:59.60
Trucker hats.

2268
01:53:59.60 --> 01:54:01.60
Flex fit hats.

2269
01:54:01.60 --> 01:54:04.60
Beanie's just on time for summer.

2270
01:54:04.60 --> 01:54:06.40
Actually, beanie's been out for a while.

2271
01:54:06.40 --> 01:54:07.60
Beanie's was a set of random months.

2272
01:54:07.60 --> 01:54:08.60
Yeah, right on mom.

2273
01:54:08.60 --> 01:54:13.16
Get yourself too much credit, but speaking of summer and winter hoodies.

2274
01:54:13.16 --> 01:54:15.08
You get hoodies on there too.

2275
01:54:15.08 --> 01:54:16.08
Legit hoodies.

2276
01:54:16.08 --> 01:54:18.08
Non-hoi and hoodies.

2277
01:54:18.08 --> 01:54:21.24
Or you're going to make, you're going to make a Hawaiian hoodie apparently.

2278
01:54:21.24 --> 01:54:25.76
Yeah, I think technically there's no such thing as Hawaiian hoodie, but I will have a lighter

2279
01:54:25.76 --> 01:54:32.16
weight hoodie for when you go to Hawaii and it turns night time and the wind breeze

2280
01:54:32.16 --> 01:54:36.20
kind of blows and you're like, hang out, shadowy, long sleeve shirt or you know.

2281
01:54:36.20 --> 01:54:37.20
And it'll look kind of dope.

2282
01:54:37.20 --> 01:54:38.20
That's why.

2283
01:54:38.20 --> 01:54:42.28
The whole approach in my opinion is the women's stuff on there too.

2284
01:54:42.28 --> 01:54:48.04
You know, for the lady troopers, some tank tops and V-neck type t-shirts made specifically

2285
01:54:48.04 --> 01:54:51.04
for the ladies.

2286
01:54:51.04 --> 01:54:53.04
Solid, this is a good one.

2287
01:54:53.04 --> 01:54:54.88
Go ahead and also, otherwise it's a support.

2288
01:54:54.88 --> 01:54:56.20
Another way to support.

2289
01:54:56.20 --> 01:54:58.48
Subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already.

2290
01:54:58.48 --> 01:55:00.76
On iTunes and Stitchering Google Player.

2291
01:55:00.76 --> 01:55:09.000
Wherever you listen to podcasts, whatever platform you choose to use also YouTube.

2292
01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.60
Yeah, you should subscribe to YouTube.

2293
01:55:12.60 --> 01:55:16.24
The reason is so you can see echoes legit videos.

2294
01:55:16.24 --> 01:55:18.96
For instance, you just really released one.

2295
01:55:18.96 --> 01:55:19.96
Thank God.

2296
01:55:19.96 --> 01:55:24.88
Yes, echo had made a video for Warpath and he put Christmas music.

2297
01:55:24.88 --> 01:55:25.88
Which we all love.

2298
01:55:25.88 --> 01:55:28.08
Which in these doing Christmas time when we were all.

2299
01:55:28.08 --> 01:55:29.72
There's everything in the time.

2300
01:55:29.72 --> 01:55:36.60
And the thing is, the video is so graphically intense and I could tell and you had actually

2301
01:55:36.60 --> 01:55:46.72
told me that it took days, days to put together three seconds worth of film.

2302
01:55:46.72 --> 01:55:49.20
And so when you showed it to me, I was super pumped.

2303
01:55:49.20 --> 01:55:51.60
And then I heard the music.

2304
01:55:51.60 --> 01:55:53.60
I was super unpomped.

2305
01:55:53.60 --> 01:55:54.60
Unpomped.

2306
01:55:54.60 --> 01:55:55.60
Yeah.

2307
01:55:55.60 --> 01:55:56.60
That was unpomped.

2308
01:55:56.60 --> 01:55:59.12
And anyways, he's readown the Warpath video.

2309
01:55:59.12 --> 01:56:03.36
Now it's good music behind it, not Christmas music.

2310
01:56:03.36 --> 01:56:04.36
We'll just say revised.

2311
01:56:04.36 --> 01:56:05.36
It's revised.

2312
01:56:05.36 --> 01:56:08.36
You know, we can still revisit the Christmas music.

2313
01:56:08.36 --> 01:56:09.36
Did you call off the old one?

2314
01:56:09.36 --> 01:56:10.96
No, no, I left it man, that's for us.

2315
01:56:10.96 --> 01:56:12.56
You know, folks who like Christmas.

2316
01:56:12.56 --> 01:56:14.36
Oh, the Grinch over here.

2317
01:56:14.36 --> 01:56:16.36
Yeah, I know.

2318
01:56:16.36 --> 01:56:17.36
But yeah, it's good.

2319
01:56:17.36 --> 01:56:22.12
YouTube, yeah, subscribe to the YouTube and leave a review on the iTunes thing.

2320
01:56:22.12 --> 01:56:24.12
If you're in the mood, that's my opinion.

2321
01:56:24.12 --> 01:56:25.12
There you go.

2322
01:56:25.12 --> 01:56:26.12
It's a good one.

2323
01:56:26.12 --> 01:56:27.32
Good way to support too.

2324
01:56:27.32 --> 01:56:28.32
Also.

2325
01:56:28.32 --> 01:56:34.64
If you are looking to improve and increase your supply of fitness gear, I just got

2326
01:56:34.64 --> 01:56:38.56
a few things for my bicep, perhaps.

2327
01:56:38.56 --> 01:56:43.04
You know, when you kind of choose your mark on a different type of fitness, you know,

2328
01:56:43.04 --> 01:56:44.96
I don't know, you stick with the same thing.

2329
01:56:44.96 --> 01:56:45.96
I get it.

2330
01:56:45.96 --> 01:56:46.96
No, but different things.

2331
01:56:46.96 --> 01:56:48.36
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you get fired up.

2332
01:56:48.36 --> 01:56:49.84
Anyway, I don't want to go into that.

2333
01:56:49.84 --> 01:56:51.08
But I got some new stuff.

2334
01:56:51.08 --> 01:56:53.96
Anyway, where you get it is, in my opinion, go to on it.

2335
01:56:53.96 --> 01:56:55.64
So on it.com slash chocolate.

2336
01:56:55.64 --> 01:56:58.08
You can get some good stuff on there, including, but not

2337
01:56:58.08 --> 01:57:01.28
limited to kettlebells, maces.

2338
01:57:01.28 --> 01:57:02.52
I'm going to get better ropes.

2339
01:57:02.52 --> 01:57:05.000
I just read some really good stuff about better ropes.

2340
01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Yeah, better ropes.

2341
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.72
I've done them, but not with any kind of regularity.

2342
01:57:08.72 --> 01:57:12.000
Yeah, yeah, I want to do a battle rope program.

2343
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:18.80
Yeah, I don't go in too much, but it's like, you know, like, if you're, it's like

2344
01:57:18.80 --> 01:57:23.12
for mechons, you know, and you can do a boy body boom, boom, boom, yeah.

2345
01:57:23.12 --> 01:57:27.64
It's like a burns a lot of calories, get to a muscular conditioning and stuff like that.

2346
01:57:27.64 --> 01:57:28.64
But I really good.

2347
01:57:28.64 --> 01:57:32.12
I was like, after you read it, it's like, you want to do better ropes from now on.

2348
01:57:32.12 --> 01:57:34.68
Anyway, good on it.com slash chocolate.

2349
01:57:34.68 --> 01:57:39.08
I got the mace from chocolate today.

2350
01:57:39.08 --> 01:57:40.08
I was fired up.

2351
01:57:40.08 --> 01:57:41.08
It's heavier than you saw.

2352
01:57:41.08 --> 01:57:42.48
Yeah, so, and I knew it was going to be heavy.

2353
01:57:42.48 --> 01:57:43.48
That's the thing.

2354
01:57:43.48 --> 01:57:45.52
Like, I know, because that's only a 20 pounder.

2355
01:57:45.52 --> 01:57:46.52
Yeah.

2356
01:57:46.52 --> 01:57:47.52
And lucky.

2357
01:57:47.52 --> 01:57:48.52
If you're, you know, that's one of those things.

2358
01:57:48.52 --> 01:57:52.24
I think, you know, when we talk about kettlebells and people will say, like, what

2359
01:57:52.24 --> 01:57:55.88
size kettlebell do you start off with?

2360
01:57:55.88 --> 01:57:57.88
It's hard to narrow that down.

2361
01:57:57.88 --> 01:57:58.88
That thing is heavy.

2362
01:57:58.88 --> 01:58:01.68
There's not too many people that are just getting all over that 20 pounder.

2363
01:58:01.68 --> 01:58:02.68
Yeah, don't even mean club.

2364
01:58:02.68 --> 01:58:03.68
This is like too heavy.

2365
01:58:03.68 --> 01:58:07.20
I've never done a mace workout, either way.

2366
01:58:07.20 --> 01:58:10.12
This is too heavy for me to do like a workout.

2367
01:58:10.12 --> 01:58:11.12
Yeah.

2368
01:58:11.12 --> 01:58:14.44
I'm like, even, like, it's so, it looks like a big, what he called, not a bowling pin, but

2369
01:58:14.44 --> 01:58:17.24
you know, the juggling pins, you know, like the people in the jaw.

2370
01:58:17.24 --> 01:58:18.24
So it looks like that.

2371
01:58:18.24 --> 01:58:19.24
But a waist 20 pounds.

2372
01:58:19.24 --> 01:58:20.24
It feels like a waist like 50 pounds.

2373
01:58:20.24 --> 01:58:21.24
Yeah, this is literally heavy.

2374
01:58:21.24 --> 01:58:22.24
It feels like that.

2375
01:58:22.24 --> 01:58:23.24
It's all big.

2376
01:58:23.24 --> 01:58:24.24
Anyway.

2377
01:58:24.24 --> 01:58:25.24
Yeah.

2378
01:58:25.24 --> 01:58:27.44
I'm going to work it in and I'm going to report back.

2379
01:58:27.44 --> 01:58:28.44
And I feel that suit.

2380
01:58:28.44 --> 01:58:30.68
I'm going to be a lot stronger than you.

2381
01:58:30.68 --> 01:58:31.68
Son.

2382
01:58:31.68 --> 01:58:32.68
Yeah, I like it.

2383
01:58:32.68 --> 01:58:33.68
That's good.

2384
01:58:33.68 --> 01:58:37.48
Speaking of that, if maybe you're thinking, oh, instead of working out, I'm going

2385
01:58:37.48 --> 01:58:42.60
to take a break, you can get the psychological warfare album that has tracks.

2386
01:58:42.60 --> 01:58:47.56
It's on iTunes, Google Play, MP3, wherever you can MP3s.

2387
01:58:47.56 --> 01:58:53.04
Just a little bit of guidance on how to overcome situations where maybe you're not going

2388
01:58:53.04 --> 01:58:54.92
to get after you and you know you should.

2389
01:58:54.92 --> 01:58:55.92
Yeah.

2390
01:58:55.92 --> 01:58:58.12
So there you go.

2391
01:58:58.12 --> 01:59:01.000
Working on psychological warfare, too, at this time.

2392
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.04
So that'll be coming in the future.

2393
01:59:03.04 --> 01:59:04.40
All your excuses are lies.

2394
01:59:04.40 --> 01:59:05.40
Yeah.

2395
01:59:05.40 --> 01:59:06.96
That can be the title psychological warfare, too.

2396
01:59:06.96 --> 01:59:08.20
All your excuses are lies.

2397
01:59:08.20 --> 01:59:09.20
Yeah.

2398
01:59:09.20 --> 01:59:10.20
See that?

2399
01:59:10.20 --> 01:59:11.20
Look, we just kind of came up.

2400
01:59:11.20 --> 01:59:12.20
Yeah, that's good.

2401
01:59:12.20 --> 01:59:13.20
I like how you do that.

2402
01:59:13.20 --> 01:59:14.20
I'd call it like a spot.

2403
01:59:14.20 --> 01:59:15.20
Like a spot.

2404
01:59:15.20 --> 01:59:17.48
I'm going to go psychological spot.

2405
01:59:17.48 --> 01:59:18.48
Yeah.

2406
01:59:18.48 --> 01:59:19.48
That's what it is.

2407
01:59:19.48 --> 01:59:21.80
Because you might call that, though, because not everyone thinks of, when you say

2408
01:59:21.80 --> 01:59:25.40
spot, you're thinking of 1994 weightlifting bodybuilding.

2409
01:59:25.40 --> 01:59:26.40
Sure.

2410
01:59:26.40 --> 01:59:27.40
Oh, no.

2411
01:59:27.40 --> 01:59:28.40
Bit of powerlifting.

2412
01:59:28.40 --> 01:59:31.88
Yeah, I guess you can't really spot on a power clean, like Olympic-climbing.

2413
01:59:31.88 --> 01:59:32.88
Yeah.

2414
01:59:32.88 --> 01:59:34.12
Nonetheless, it is a spot nonetheless.

2415
01:59:34.12 --> 01:59:35.96
We got this award analogy you want to use.

2416
01:59:35.96 --> 01:59:41.16
I think the spot is the best because you don't need a spot necessarily.

2417
01:59:41.16 --> 01:59:42.16
Most of the time, you don't need it.

2418
01:59:42.16 --> 01:59:43.16
Most of the time.

2419
01:59:43.16 --> 01:59:44.16
Cool.

2420
01:59:44.16 --> 01:59:46.80
But if you got a spot out there and you need the spot, both there it is.

2421
01:59:46.80 --> 01:59:48.44
And he's a spot in here and he's going to bring you through.

2422
01:59:48.44 --> 01:59:51.24
You're not going to let the bar bear you.

2423
01:59:51.24 --> 01:59:52.24
You want to stand?

2424
01:59:52.24 --> 01:59:53.24
Fair enough.

2425
01:59:53.24 --> 01:59:54.68
Also, chocolate some tea.

2426
01:59:54.68 --> 01:59:57.84
It's called chocolate tea.

2427
01:59:57.84 --> 01:59:59.64
Interesting lean off.

2428
01:59:59.64 --> 02:00:05.48
Dry tea, which is tea bags and in a can, which have been popping every day, by the way.

2429
02:00:05.48 --> 02:00:06.48
It's so good.

2430
02:00:06.48 --> 02:00:09.12
I'm not going to say it's an anti-najja medication.

2431
02:00:09.12 --> 02:00:10.76
I'm not going to say that.

2432
02:00:10.76 --> 02:00:16.08
But as it turns out, it's kind of an anti-najja medication.

2433
02:00:16.08 --> 02:00:17.84
Super refreshing that they can't buy the way.

2434
02:00:17.84 --> 02:00:23.40
Also anti-weteness, because once you drink chocolate tea, you can that lift 8,000 pounds

2435
02:00:23.40 --> 02:00:24.40
automatically.

2436
02:00:24.40 --> 02:00:25.40
Hey, it's available.

2437
02:00:25.40 --> 02:00:26.40
Think Canada too.

2438
02:00:26.40 --> 02:00:28.32
On Amazon and Canada, that's new.

2439
02:00:28.32 --> 02:00:32.68
So check out Canadian folks up there hanging out with Jody Minick somewhere.

2440
02:00:32.68 --> 02:00:33.68
There.

2441
02:00:33.68 --> 02:00:34.68
Ottawa.

2442
02:00:34.68 --> 02:00:38.28
Then you can get it there too.

2443
02:00:38.28 --> 02:00:40.12
Also got some books.

2444
02:00:40.12 --> 02:00:43.28
Way the Warrior Kid and Mark's Mission.

2445
02:00:43.28 --> 02:00:46.28
Those are for children.

2446
02:00:46.28 --> 02:00:50.40
But I think everyone that reads him gets something out of them.

2447
02:00:50.40 --> 02:00:51.96
You just have to check them out.

2448
02:00:51.96 --> 02:00:52.96
They're right.

2449
02:00:52.96 --> 02:00:55.20
That video you did with Brian Rose.

2450
02:00:55.20 --> 02:00:56.20
Yeah.

2451
02:00:56.20 --> 02:01:00.52
The one that everyone saw my brother's watching the video.

2452
02:01:00.52 --> 02:01:03.24
I don't know why he's all like surprised.

2453
02:01:03.24 --> 02:01:04.24
He's impressed.

2454
02:01:04.24 --> 02:01:05.24
Okay, I get it.

2455
02:01:05.24 --> 02:01:06.72
But he's all surprised and impressed.

2456
02:01:06.72 --> 02:01:07.72
You know the difference.

2457
02:01:07.72 --> 02:01:09.72
So he's watching the video.

2458
02:01:09.72 --> 02:01:13.48
You know how you basically the part where you're explaining where the work here, part

2459
02:01:13.48 --> 02:01:14.48
two.

2460
02:01:14.48 --> 02:01:15.48
Mark's Mission.

2461
02:01:15.48 --> 02:01:19.20
The logical bully, you know, did this thing and now Mark wants to fight and we can fight

2462
02:01:19.20 --> 02:01:20.20
now.

2463
02:01:20.20 --> 02:01:21.20
No, it's due to the same kind of one.

2464
02:01:21.20 --> 02:01:26.12
So I'm called Jake's like, you know, comes in and he's all, hey, cool.

2465
02:01:26.12 --> 02:01:27.12
You can fight them.

2466
02:01:27.12 --> 02:01:30.16
So I was like, okay, all right, I'm going to take you know, getting that's whatever.

2467
02:01:30.16 --> 02:01:31.16
Okay, you can fight them.

2468
02:01:31.16 --> 02:01:33.60
But first, you got to do recon or Intel, right?

2469
02:01:33.60 --> 02:01:34.60
Intel, gather whatever.

2470
02:01:34.60 --> 02:01:35.60
See what up.

2471
02:01:35.60 --> 02:01:40.24
And so he does and he finds out all this stuff, you know, and through like finding

2472
02:01:40.24 --> 02:01:43.52
the stuff, whatever he gains like a little bit understanding and whatever.

2473
02:01:43.52 --> 02:01:47.000
So instead of fighting them, maybe you should help them kind of thing.

2474
02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:48.28
So it's like this little curve bought.

2475
02:01:48.28 --> 02:01:51.44
It's like man, it's like kind of taking the high ground when you don't expect

2476
02:01:51.44 --> 02:01:52.44
to.

2477
02:01:52.44 --> 02:01:53.44
He does kind of like that.

2478
02:01:53.44 --> 02:01:54.44
He's all impressed.

2479
02:01:54.44 --> 02:01:56.000
He had an already pressed with it.

2480
02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Not bad.

2481
02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:58.000
I'm not a meat that thing.

2482
02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:59.68
Still read it to my little girl.

2483
02:01:59.68 --> 02:02:00.68
That's Jack.

2484
02:02:00.68 --> 02:02:01.68
It's kind of the ethos, right?

2485
02:02:01.68 --> 02:02:03.80
The way of the worry kid ethos, you just read it.

2486
02:02:03.80 --> 02:02:05.56
You just keep read when you're done reading it, you read it.

2487
02:02:05.56 --> 02:02:06.56
You get started all over.

2488
02:02:06.56 --> 02:02:07.56
Yeah.

2489
02:02:07.56 --> 02:02:08.56
Yeah.

2490
02:02:08.56 --> 02:02:09.56
She likes it.

2491
02:02:09.56 --> 02:02:10.56
She liked the paper, Michelle Pumpkin.

2492
02:02:10.56 --> 02:02:11.56
Yeah.

2493
02:02:11.56 --> 02:02:12.56
Situation.

2494
02:02:12.56 --> 02:02:14.56
That was actually pretty fun.

2495
02:02:14.56 --> 02:02:15.56
Yeah.

2496
02:02:15.56 --> 02:02:16.56
It was good.

2497
02:02:16.56 --> 02:02:18.56
And also, I'm trying to figure it out.

2498
02:02:18.56 --> 02:02:19.56
Oh yeah, big toe.

2499
02:02:19.56 --> 02:02:21.16
Also the field manual.

2500
02:02:21.16 --> 02:02:25.32
Discipline equals freedom, field manual, best book ever written.

2501
02:02:25.32 --> 02:02:28.56
Best book physically look at my opinion back on black.

2502
02:02:28.56 --> 02:02:31.72
What do you think of that front cover for photograph?

2503
02:02:31.72 --> 02:02:32.72
Do you like that?

2504
02:02:32.72 --> 02:02:33.72
Yeah, you think.

2505
02:02:33.72 --> 02:02:34.72
Very iconic.

2506
02:02:34.72 --> 02:02:35.72
Footer.

2507
02:02:35.72 --> 02:02:36.72
Yeah.

2508
02:02:36.72 --> 02:02:37.72
Yeah.

2509
02:02:37.72 --> 02:02:38.72
That's a good one.

2510
02:02:38.72 --> 02:02:41.84
It's like Woody call, like a manual for.

2511
02:02:41.84 --> 02:02:46.60
If you make it a manual for life in general, I think you'd be on the good path right there.

2512
02:02:46.60 --> 02:02:47.60
I agree.

2513
02:02:47.60 --> 02:02:49.60
I agree.

2514
02:02:49.60 --> 02:02:54.60
If you need a manual for some leadership, you got an extreme ownership.

2515
02:02:54.60 --> 02:02:57.80
That's the book that I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin.

2516
02:02:57.80 --> 02:03:00.88
And it's about calm, I leadership, and how you can apply it.

2517
02:03:00.88 --> 02:03:05.52
The lessons that we learn on the battlefield to everything you do in your business and

2518
02:03:05.52 --> 02:03:09.64
in your life and your relationships with people.

2519
02:03:09.64 --> 02:03:16.04
And also coming pretty soon actually is the fall of all of that book that I also wrote

2520
02:03:16.04 --> 02:03:19.32
with Dave, the dichotomy of leadership.

2521
02:03:19.32 --> 02:03:23.52
It is, you hear us talk about dichotomy all the time.

2522
02:03:23.52 --> 02:03:26.76
It's actually the last chapter of extreme ownership.

2523
02:03:26.76 --> 02:03:30.08
This is the trickiest thing about leadership is trying to balance this dichotomy.

2524
02:03:30.08 --> 02:03:36.52
So we talk about it and do deep dive and get granular on how to balance that dichotomy

2525
02:03:36.52 --> 02:03:42.44
of leadership in that book, which is titled, the dichotomy of leadership.

2526
02:03:42.44 --> 02:03:43.44
You can preorder it right now.

2527
02:03:43.44 --> 02:03:46.20
It comes out September 25th.

2528
02:03:46.20 --> 02:03:51.28
If you don't want to get a copy when it comes out, then don't order it now.

2529
02:03:51.28 --> 02:03:52.52
And you won't get one.

2530
02:03:52.52 --> 02:03:56.40
Because it's going to sell out and the publishers are slacking as usual.

2531
02:03:56.40 --> 02:04:00.16
No, but like, well, wait, but there's probably only a preta few of these because

2532
02:04:00.16 --> 02:04:01.16
you're connected.

2533
02:04:01.16 --> 02:04:02.16
Yeah.

2534
02:04:02.16 --> 02:04:05.32
The projected numbers are off always.

2535
02:04:05.32 --> 02:04:08.44
You want to get the, you want to get the first edition.

2536
02:04:08.44 --> 02:04:09.44
That's my opinion.

2537
02:04:09.44 --> 02:04:10.44
So do that.

2538
02:04:10.44 --> 02:04:17.32
And for all, for leadership training on site, beyond the books, beyond the podcast,

2539
02:04:17.32 --> 02:04:18.80
I have Eshelon front.

2540
02:04:18.80 --> 02:04:23.08
It's our leadership consulting company.

2541
02:04:23.08 --> 02:04:26.48
We solve problems through leadership.

2542
02:04:26.48 --> 02:04:31.44
Also we have the master, which is a leadership conference.

2543
02:04:31.44 --> 02:04:32.44
There's only one more.

2544
02:04:32.44 --> 02:04:35.56
This year, it's in San Francisco, Mr. 006.

2545
02:04:35.56 --> 02:04:37.72
It's October 17th and 18th.

2546
02:04:37.72 --> 02:04:40.36
You have to register for that at extremalnership.com.

2547
02:04:40.36 --> 02:04:46.000
Every master we've done has sold out this one will sell out to and also for current military

2548
02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.96
law enforcement, board of patrol, firefighters, paramedics, first responders.

2549
02:04:49.96 --> 02:04:55.20
We've got the role calls 001, September 21st in Dallas, Texas.

2550
02:04:55.20 --> 02:05:00.08
It's a focus one day leadership training seminar for people that are in uniform handling

2551
02:05:00.08 --> 02:05:04.88
stressful situations and you can also register for that at extremalnership.com.

2552
02:05:04.88 --> 02:05:14.56
And until we are live at the master in San Francisco or at the role call in Texas or at the

2553
02:05:14.56 --> 02:05:17.12
immersion camp in Maine.

2554
02:05:17.12 --> 02:05:24.72
Until then, if you want to cruise kind of hard with us, we are on the interwebs on Twitter,

2555
02:05:24.72 --> 02:05:29.92
on Instagram and yes on that baseball table.

2556
02:05:29.92 --> 02:05:34.32
Go to that atcliotrals and I am at Jockel Willink and thanks to all the people in uniform

2557
02:05:34.32 --> 02:05:39.68
out there, military police law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics, border patrol,

2558
02:05:39.68 --> 02:05:42.24
all first responders really.

2559
02:05:42.24 --> 02:05:47.68
We won't be able to do what we do without you doing what you do.

2560
02:05:47.68 --> 02:05:53.32
So thank you for protecting us and taking care of us and also thanks to your families who

2561
02:05:53.32 --> 02:05:59.68
support you while you support us and to everyone else.

2562
02:05:59.68 --> 02:06:11.68
Thanks for listening and remember what Vigadia said that it isn't just size or numbers or

2563
02:06:11.68 --> 02:06:17.000
even courage itself that will ensure victory instead.

2564
02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:23.36
It is exact observance of discipline.

2565
02:06:23.36 --> 02:06:26.12
That is what it takes.

2566
02:06:26.12 --> 02:06:27.36
That is what you need.

2567
02:06:27.36 --> 02:06:31.40
So go out there and get after it.

2568
02:06:31.40 --> 02:06:54.28
And until next time, this is echo and jockel out.
