[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 71.
[00:00:05] With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
[00:00:09] Good evening, echo.
[00:00:11] Good evening.
[00:00:17] A helmet for my pillow.
[00:00:19] A poncho for my bed.
[00:00:21] My rifle rests across my chest.
[00:00:24] The stars swing overhead.
[00:00:28] And to your holes and gun pits, kill them with rifles and knives.
[00:00:33] Feed them with lead until they are dead, and widowed are their wives.
[00:00:39] Sons of the mothers who gave you honor and gift a birth.
[00:00:44] Strike with the knife till blood and life run out upon the earth.
[00:00:50] Marines, keep faith with your glory.
[00:00:53] Keep to your trembling hole in true to your fuel of nip on steel can't penetrate your
[00:01:00] soul.
[00:01:02] Closing they charge all howling.
[00:01:05] Their breasts all targets large.
[00:01:08] The gun must shake.
[00:01:10] The bullets make a slaughter of their charge.
[00:01:16] Red are the flashing tracers.
[00:01:18] Yellow the bursting shells.
[00:01:21] Verses the cry of men who die.
[00:01:24] Shrill are the wounded's yells.
[00:01:28] God how the night real stricken.
[00:01:31] She streaks with orange spark.
[00:01:34] The mortars lash and the cannons crash.
[00:01:38] Have crucified the dark.
[00:01:42] St. Michael Angel of Battle.
[00:01:44] We praise you to God on high.
[00:01:47] The foe you gave was strong and brave and unafraid to die.
[00:01:54] Speak to the Lord for our comrades, killed when the battle seemed lost.
[00:01:59] They went to meet a bright defeat.
[00:02:03] The heroes holocaust.
[00:02:06] Falses the vault of the victor.
[00:02:09] Empty are living pride.
[00:02:11] For those who fell, there is no hell.
[00:02:16] For the brave who died.
[00:02:23] And that's a excerpt from a poem that opens a book called Helmet from My Pillow.
[00:02:33] Then the book was written by a guy named Robert Lecki.
[00:02:41] Otherwise known as Lucky.
[00:02:42] Everybody called him Lucky.
[00:02:45] And he was a machine gunner.
[00:02:48] And then a scout with the first Marine Division in World War II.
[00:02:54] And he's a decent part of the HBO series, the Pacific, which is if you haven't watched
[00:03:03] that, just buy it right now and watch it.
[00:03:07] It's awesome.
[00:03:09] It's based on a bunch of different books and a bunch of different events from the Pacific.
[00:03:13] And a lot of them Eugene Sledge.
[00:03:16] That's another one with the old breed.
[00:03:18] There's a lot that he plays a main role.
[00:03:20] John Basel, plays a large role in that series.
[00:03:26] There's other a bunch of other books.
[00:03:27] We've done a bunch of them on this podcast.
[00:03:31] And this one is another one.
[00:03:35] And I was thinking to myself, like, well, you know, should I do Helmet from my pillow?
[00:03:39] I'd read it a long time ago.
[00:03:41] And I thought to myself, you know, we've kind of covered the Pacific pretty well.
[00:03:47] And I'm just straight up wrong.
[00:03:49] So wrong.
[00:03:50] Because everyone's experience is different.
[00:03:52] There's things that are the same.
[00:03:53] And his viewpoint on things is just a different viewpoint.
[00:03:59] And equally important to understanding not only the war, not only what they experience in
[00:04:07] war, but also a whole other side of human nature that we need to learn about.
[00:04:14] And yeah, there's a lot to go over.
[00:04:18] So a little introduction here.
[00:04:20] And just to give you a little background on Lucky Lucky.
[00:04:25] He enlisted on January 5, 1942.
[00:04:27] He tried to join up the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, but a surgically
[00:04:31] correctable condition disqualified him.
[00:04:35] Now he was back and acceptable.
[00:04:37] Just that tells us a lot.
[00:04:39] He was a civilian, not a professional fighting man.
[00:04:44] But he became a warrior.
[00:04:49] The author was one of those young men.
[00:04:52] Many not yet 20 who were gentle human beings that were transformed by training hardship and
[00:05:00] the war into fighting Marines.
[00:05:06] These were the boys who became men and stood against and then beat back to the world's
[00:05:12] most vicious fighting machines.
[00:05:16] They left behind them a heritage of decency.
[00:05:23] That hopefully will live forever.
[00:05:27] And then that's from the introduction.
[00:05:32] And so again, after World after Pearl Harbor, you've seen pictures.
[00:05:41] Using pictures of guys wrapped around the block, waiting to go to the recruiting office.
[00:05:45] He goes to recruiting office.
[00:05:47] He can't go in at first.
[00:05:48] Eventually he gets in.
[00:05:49] It takes him a month to get in and then he's off to boot camp.
[00:05:52] And we've seen all kinds of representations and books and movies of Marine Corps boot camp
[00:05:58] and in boot camp, in general.
[00:06:00] But I just had to hit on this one a little bit.
[00:06:03] Because it's just another perspective that shows you, shows you his view of it and gave
[00:06:09] me a, not even a better understanding, a clear understanding of what people are going through
[00:06:14] when they're going through boot camp.
[00:06:16] And I remember actually, I remember this about boot camp.
[00:06:20] I, they, they wrote, we had to write something when I was going through boot camp.
[00:06:26] And I don't know if I've talked about this before, but we were going through boot camp.
[00:06:29] They said, hey, write down, you know, the top three things you're learning.
[00:06:32] Right?
[00:06:33] You had to, we all had to.
[00:06:34] This is Navy boot camp.
[00:06:37] And I wrote down something along the lines of, I wrote something along lines of the
[00:06:44] brainwashing seems very effective.
[00:06:46] Right?
[00:06:47] I'll, I'll do it.
[00:06:48] I was 18, 18, I think I just turned 19.
[00:06:53] And that's, because I was a rebellious kid, right?
[00:06:55] And so I'm thinking they're brainwashing us.
[00:06:57] And I wasn't against it.
[00:06:59] Yeah.
[00:07:00] I, it was kind of one of those statements where I was saying, I was kind of being sarcastic,
[00:07:03] but I was also kind of being true.
[00:07:04] True.
[00:07:05] We call it cracking, but faking.
[00:07:07] Okay.
[00:07:08] We'll roll with that.
[00:07:10] So that's what I was doing.
[00:07:13] And, and I remember, they didn't say anything about anything anyone had written about what
[00:07:18] we were learning or whatever.
[00:07:19] They called that one out.
[00:07:21] The chiefs that were running my boot camp company, they were, you know what I said?
[00:07:25] And if you think you're getting brainwashed, you know what?
[00:07:28] This is what's going to save you and they went on a big thing.
[00:07:30] To counter my, my assessment.
[00:07:33] So there's a little bit of that here in what, what, what, what Lucky said.
[00:07:38] He says the same kind of thing and he gets the same kind of, he gets to the same place.
[00:07:42] But here we go, going to the book, they're at boot camp Marine Corps boot camp in dock.
[00:07:50] And here we go.
[00:07:51] Sergeant Bello marched us to the quarter masters.
[00:07:55] It was there.
[00:07:56] We stripped off all vestiges of personality.
[00:08:00] It is the quarter masters.
[00:08:01] So if you, if you don't know, a quarter master in the military is someone that basically
[00:08:05] runs supply, they give you gear.
[00:08:07] That's what they are.
[00:08:08] So it is the quarter masters who make soldiers, sailors and Marines in their presence
[00:08:14] one strips down with each divestment a trait is lost.
[00:08:20] The discard of a garment marks the quiet death of an idiosyncrasy.
[00:08:27] I take off my socks.
[00:08:29] Gone is a propensity for stripes or clocks or checks or even solids.
[00:08:36] And it is a tendency to combine purple socks with a brown tie.
[00:08:41] My socks, henceforth, will be tan.
[00:08:43] They will neither be soiled nor rolled nor gotty nor restrained nor holy.
[00:08:49] They will be tan.
[00:08:51] The only other thing they may be is clean.
[00:08:55] So it is with it all until one stands naked, struggling with an embarrassment that has
[00:09:02] entirely lost on the leconic shades who work in the quarter master sheds.
[00:09:08] Thus naked, thus quivering, a man is defenseless before the quarter master.
[00:09:14] Character clings to clothes that have gone into the discard as skin and hair stick to adhesive
[00:09:21] tape.
[00:09:22] It is torn from you.
[00:09:25] Then the quarter master shades swarm over you with measuring tape, a cascade of clothes falls
[00:09:29] upon you washing you clean of personality.
[00:09:34] When you have emerged from this, you are but a number.
[00:09:38] Three, five, one, tree, nine or one, United States Marine Corps.
[00:09:46] Twenty minutes before, there had stood in your place a human being surrounded by some 60 other
[00:09:54] human beings.
[00:09:56] And now there is stood one number among 60 others.
[00:10:00] The sum of all to be a training platoon.
[00:10:03] But the parts have no meaning except in the context of the whole.
[00:10:10] So there is little psychological reason why they do that, how they do it.
[00:10:13] And you can see it works.
[00:10:16] You know all those little things that you have, all the little things that make you you,
[00:10:19] we are going to take them away.
[00:10:20] That is what we are going to do.
[00:10:22] And there is so, there is this weird thing because when I went through boot camp, I wanted
[00:10:31] that.
[00:10:33] Take it away from me.
[00:10:34] And I have said this before on the podcast.
[00:10:37] It is a blank slate.
[00:10:38] When you go into boot camp, they shave your head, they take your clothes, they take all
[00:10:43] that personal stuff and you get a blank slate.
[00:10:46] They tell you like this, you need to do to succeed here.
[00:10:49] All that stuff you have done in the past, you are knucklehead, we do not care.
[00:10:52] These are what you got to do now.
[00:10:54] And it is awesome.
[00:10:56] And for a lot of people myself included, you are now, you are becoming part of something
[00:11:02] that is bigger than you.
[00:11:03] That is a good feeling.
[00:11:04] You know, it is a good feeling.
[00:11:07] I liked it.
[00:11:10] I go so far to say, I love it.
[00:11:15] And they do the same thing.
[00:11:16] By the way, they do the same thing to you.
[00:11:17] When you get to your seal training class, your Buds class, you get your head shaved
[00:11:22] again.
[00:11:23] You get another set of uniforms, you are all going to dress the same, you are all going
[00:11:26] to look the same.
[00:11:27] Yeah, I think that head shaving thing would really do it for a lot of people.
[00:11:30] Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[00:11:31] For sure.
[00:11:32] Just because that is some people's whole personality, you know, they are hair.
[00:11:35] It is like that.
[00:11:36] They like that hair.
[00:11:40] Now of course, fast-forwarding a little bit.
[00:11:44] But I found this interesting back to the book.
[00:11:47] In six weeks of training, they are seemed not to exist a single pattern, apart from meals.
[00:11:53] All seemed chaos, marching drilling in manual arms, listening to lectures on military courtesy,
[00:11:57] and saluting the right hand will strike the head at 45 degree angle midway from the right
[00:12:01] eye.
[00:12:02] Listening to lectures on Marine, jargon from now on, everything floor, street, ground, everything
[00:12:08] is the deck.
[00:12:10] Cleaning and polishing ones rifle until it is shown like an ornament, shaving daily,
[00:12:14] weather, hairy or beardless.
[00:12:16] It was all a jumble.
[00:12:18] What are we going to do?
[00:12:19] Salute the japs to death?
[00:12:21] No, we're going to blind them with spit and polish.
[00:12:23] Yeah, or barber the bastards.
[00:12:26] All the logic seemed to be on our side.
[00:12:29] The Marine Corps seemed a madness.
[00:12:31] So they're thinking, what are we getting out of this?
[00:12:33] You want us to polish?
[00:12:34] How many teachers ought to shoot the rifle?
[00:12:39] Continuing on, it was a madness.
[00:12:43] But it was disciplined.
[00:12:46] Part from us recruits, no one in Paris, island seemed to care for anything but discipline.
[00:12:52] There was absolutely no talk of war.
[00:12:54] We heard no fiery lectures about killing japs, such as we were to hear later on in new river,
[00:13:00] which is the place where they go to train.
[00:13:02] Everything, but discipline.
[00:13:04] Marine Corps discipline was steadfastly mocked and ridiculed.
[00:13:09] Be it holiness or high finance.
[00:13:14] These drill instructors were dedicated Martinets, like the sensualist who feels that if
[00:13:19] a thing cannot be eaten, drunk or taken a bed, it does not exist.
[00:13:25] So were these Martinets in their outlook.
[00:13:28] All was discipline.
[00:13:30] There you go.
[00:13:32] I actually, I thought that word struck me, Martinets.
[00:13:37] So I did a little, you know, I looked it up.
[00:13:40] And the etymology of it is there was a French general that created a certain type of drill,
[00:13:49] close order drill procedures.
[00:13:51] And his name was General Jean Martinette.
[00:13:54] Jean Martinette.
[00:13:55] So that's where he, that's where that word comes from.
[00:13:57] That it means that you're strict, disciplinary.
[00:14:00] Wouldn't it be Martinets?
[00:14:03] Martinets, I guess so, for those that speak French.
[00:14:06] French Canadian background.
[00:14:08] Did not know that was story.
[00:14:11] Oh, that's right, because you were friends with Jodie, you knew him.
[00:14:15] Bonded.
[00:14:16] We bonded over your Canadian roots.
[00:14:18] 100%.
[00:14:20] Nice.
[00:14:22] Another great example or great paragraph about what this feels like back to the book.
[00:14:28] It is a process of surrender.
[00:14:31] At every turn, at every hour, it seemed a habit or a preference.
[00:14:37] And it seemed a habit to be given up.
[00:14:38] And adjustment had to be made.
[00:14:41] Even in the mess hall, we learned that nothing mattered so little as a man's own likes
[00:14:47] or dislikes.
[00:14:49] And I think that's what it is.
[00:14:52] That that's what's so cool about.
[00:14:53] That's what I loved.
[00:14:55] Right, when you join the military, it's all stripped away.
[00:14:59] All these little comforts that you have, they stripped them away.
[00:15:03] And you're left with the raw self.
[00:15:05] That's what you're left with.
[00:15:08] And you start putting everything else above yourself.
[00:15:11] It's a very humbling process.
[00:15:15] Back to the book.
[00:15:16] Orst in all this process of surrender was the ruthless refusal to permit a man the slightest
[00:15:22] privacy.
[00:15:24] Everything was done in the open.
[00:15:25] Rising, waking, writing letters, receiving mails, receiving mail, making beds, washing,
[00:15:31] shaving, combing ones hair, emptying ones bowels, all was done in public and shaped to this
[00:15:38] style and structure of the sergeant.
[00:15:43] So that that one right there, going to the bathroom.
[00:15:48] And you get to like in Navy boot camp, the first time you go on the bathroom, there's just
[00:15:52] toilets.
[00:15:53] There's no doors.
[00:15:54] There's no walls.
[00:15:55] Just just 30 toilets in a row.
[00:15:58] A prison style.
[00:15:59] A prison style.
[00:16:00] And you're actually prisons have you only.
[00:16:01] And they're with your little roommate.
[00:16:02] Let even prison style.
[00:16:03] You sit down and by the way, you can't salmon a weight till no one else is in there because
[00:16:08] they give you, you have to go from this to this to this.
[00:16:11] And then okay, we're back in the barracks.
[00:16:12] You can go to the bathroom now.
[00:16:13] So there you go.
[00:16:14] You're going to sit down 18 inches from some other dude.
[00:16:19] That's going to the bathroom.
[00:16:21] That's emptying his bowels.
[00:16:24] And there's no privacy.
[00:16:26] And those, I mean, you may have never taken a crap in front of another human being.
[00:16:34] Most people haven't.
[00:16:35] Why would you?
[00:16:36] So you have this little sanctuary right?
[00:16:40] Where you going to get me private.
[00:16:42] Gone.
[00:16:43] It's gone.
[00:16:44] All exposed.
[00:16:46] Strip the way.
[00:16:47] Yeah.
[00:16:48] It's kind of football is.
[00:16:49] By the way, okay.
[00:16:50] But thing is football, that's kind of like it's cool to do that.
[00:16:53] The coaches don't make you do that.
[00:16:55] It's just like, if you're shy, you know, or that kind of thing, like some guy didn't have
[00:17:00] stalls.
[00:17:01] They did, but yeah, they did, but like the point is like it was kind of like the cool
[00:17:07] culture.
[00:17:08] So guys wouldn't close the stall.
[00:17:10] Oh, okay.
[00:17:11] If there was a shy guy who didn't want to shower, he'd go to his like room
[00:17:13] and shower.
[00:17:14] They'd be like, you know, so it was like the more open and like whatever you were,
[00:17:18] the cooler it kind of was.
[00:17:20] But that's what it did just because if you're shy.
[00:17:21] So if you're shy.
[00:17:22] Yeah.
[00:17:23] It came in shy is like you'd have that feeling, you know.
[00:17:26] Yeah.
[00:17:27] But man, I did it.
[00:17:28] I actually remember that because I had never, I was, whatever I was, 19 years old, sitting
[00:17:36] down next to a dude for the first time, taking a crap.
[00:17:40] I never done that before.
[00:17:41] Why would you do that?
[00:17:42] Yeah.
[00:17:43] No, you have your own little private, or real?
[00:17:44] Do you have your own private space?
[00:17:45] This is my little time.
[00:17:46] As you know, it's not.
[00:17:47] Not your private time.
[00:17:48] Back to the book.
[00:17:49] If you were on Don't, you'd be like, you know, you'd be like, you know, you'd be like,
[00:17:53] on Don in Paris, Island, which is where I'm reading corporate bootcamp is, or one of them,
[00:17:57] there's also one here in Tandy, Eagle.
[00:18:00] If you are on Don in Paris, Island, taking a part in those first few weeks is at the
[00:18:04] rifle range that they start to put you together again.
[00:18:08] So that's, and he goes into some pretty good.
[00:18:12] He talks about now that rebuilding.
[00:18:15] And finally, and again, it's great details, great information, very cool, read, very cool
[00:18:21] perspective.
[00:18:25] That's why you get the book and read it.
[00:18:27] Back to the book.
[00:18:28] In five weeks, they had made us over.
[00:18:32] Another week of training remained, but the desired change already had taken place.
[00:18:38] Most important in this transformation was not the hardening of my flesh, where the sharpening
[00:18:43] of my eyes, but the new attitude of mind, I was a Marine.
[00:18:55] Now that's the big transformation.
[00:18:59] And now like I said, they go, they go to start their advanced training.
[00:19:03] So in bootcamp, you don't, you're not learning, you learn some technical stuff, but you're
[00:19:07] basically just learning a new attitude, right?
[00:19:09] Learning to be a Marine, and then they go from there, they go to a place called New River,
[00:19:14] where they're going to do some more training, and they're going to start learning to
[00:19:18] be actual fighting Marines.
[00:19:21] So here we go back to the book and talk about New River.
[00:19:24] Here, the only talent was that of the foot soldier, the only tool, the handgun, here,
[00:19:33] cultivated the oblique and the delicate, soon-parished, like gardenias and desert.
[00:19:42] So we're starting to get into some hard-living, and they form up into companies and
[00:19:50] hands up in an age company, second battalion, first Marine regiment.
[00:19:56] And they get some other veterans that come to start help them prepare for combat.
[00:20:05] And here's what he says about that.
[00:20:07] The first, and this is the first Marine regiment, the first also received a vital leavening
[00:20:13] of veteran NCOs.
[00:20:15] That's not a commission officer.
[00:20:16] So these are like the mid-level enlisted guys that run the show.
[00:20:21] They would teach us.
[00:20:23] They would train us. They would turn us into fighting troops.
[00:20:27] From them, we would learn our weapons.
[00:20:30] From them, we would take our character and temper.
[00:20:35] They were the old breed.
[00:20:38] And we were the new, the volunteer youths who had come from the comfort of home to the
[00:20:44] hardship of war.
[00:20:47] The next three years, all of these would be my comrades, the men of the first Marine division.
[00:20:57] And that's true.
[00:20:58] They always try and take veterans and they shouldn't say always.
[00:21:05] Because actually in D-Day, they wanted a bunch of new guys.
[00:21:08] They wanted people that hadn't been in combat before.
[00:21:10] But in the SEAL teams, we do that.
[00:21:12] I got back from Ramadi with my task unit.
[00:21:15] We didn't, and they split them up all put them in all different task units.
[00:21:19] So we had all these guys with all the spirits going to these other task units.
[00:21:22] This is pretty normal.
[00:21:25] And that's where the true learning comes from.
[00:21:27] You're going to get that face to face, that hands on.
[00:21:31] And that true connection to what's going on overseas.
[00:21:34] And here's some of the things that they did back to the book, Dr. Gundryl and
[00:21:40] Norman Claycher, know your weapon, know it intimately, know it with almost the insight of
[00:21:46] its inventor, be able to take it apart blindfolded or in the dark to put it together,
[00:21:52] be able to recite mechanically a detailed description of the gun's operation, know the
[00:21:56] part played by every member of the squad from gunner down to the unfortunate who carried
[00:22:01] the water can or the machine gun boxes as well as their own rifles.
[00:22:07] So you're going to learn this weapon like better than better than the inventors what
[00:22:15] they're saying.
[00:22:16] That's how well you need to know it.
[00:22:17] And you know what?
[00:22:18] I believe that.
[00:22:19] That inventor doesn't do what these guys do with that machine gun.
[00:22:22] I'll tell you, if you like the guys that I, the pig gunners we call them, guys that
[00:22:26] carry the mark 48, which is our big heavy weapon, guys that carry that when you watch
[00:22:31] them, it's beautiful.
[00:22:33] It looks the most, it's beautiful.
[00:22:35] So how quick and how fast and how they combat load that thing and hit the ground and clear
[00:22:40] reloads, it was like magic.
[00:22:44] Magic.
[00:22:47] Love that.
[00:22:50] Now there's not just learning about weapons, right?
[00:22:54] There's other things you gotta do.
[00:22:56] You gotta get, you still gotta continue to live a hard life.
[00:22:58] You still gotta get mentally and physically conditioned for combat and what better way to
[00:23:03] do that than some road marches, some road marches, which we've talked about many times here.
[00:23:11] Back to the book, a whole battalion was on the march and my poor squad was tucked away somewhere
[00:23:16] at the center or center rear.
[00:23:19] Clouds have red dust settled upon us.
[00:23:21] My helmet banged irritably against the machine gun that was boring into my shoulder or
[00:23:26] else it was bumped forward, madingly, over my eyes by the movement of my pack.
[00:23:32] My eyes were so out, I dared not drink anymore from my canteen.
[00:23:36] I had no idea how far we had to go.
[00:23:40] My dung agrees were saturated with sweat, their light green darkened by perspiration.
[00:23:45] There had been joking and even some singing the first mile out.
[00:23:50] Now only the bird sang, but for us there was just the foot of feet, the clank of canteens,
[00:23:57] the creak of leather rifle slings, the occasional horse cracking of voice raised and breath
[00:24:03] wasted in a curse.
[00:24:05] Every hour we got a ten minute break, then came the command, often on.
[00:24:12] It means off your behind and on your feet, cursing, hating both command and commandant,
[00:24:19] straining, we rose to our feet and began again the dull plotting rhythm of the march.
[00:24:27] That's the old road march.
[00:24:33] And so they're doing this type of hard training and they're doing maneuvers, they're
[00:24:40] preparing, they're doing mock beach landings, they're doing all those things and they're
[00:24:45] also getting some occasional liberty.
[00:24:47] Do you guys know what you want to liberty is, is a civilian?
[00:24:50] See, it's in word that I throw out there sometimes, it means time off.
[00:24:55] It means time off.
[00:24:58] It's from the Navy, but the Marine Corps uses as well.
[00:25:02] It means time off.
[00:25:03] So these guys, even though they're working hard, when boot camp, you don't get any liberty.
[00:25:07] No, you just stay in boot camp for 13 weeks, you don't get any liberty.
[00:25:11] Once you're a fleet marine or you're in the regular Navy, you get liberty.
[00:25:15] So you can go and do some stuff.
[00:25:18] So these guys are going out and doing stuff.
[00:25:20] What do you think they're doing?
[00:25:21] 18 years old.
[00:25:23] And ready to go to war, they're going to go out and get after it.
[00:25:26] In the classic 18 year old sex of the word.
[00:25:31] Actually, that's when I got in that context is how I got turned on to the expression
[00:25:36] get after it.
[00:25:37] Oh, from the context of going out and partying.
[00:25:39] Yes, exactly.
[00:25:40] And I don't know that partying is what we're talking about.
[00:25:43] That's a term that it sounds pretty lame, but that's what we're talking about.
[00:25:46] I think everybody understands that term.
[00:25:48] Drinking, chasing girls, partying.
[00:25:51] That's what we're talking about.
[00:25:52] And I guess it's a commonly used term because you hear people say, like I remember
[00:25:56] seen an article about some school, some college being the number three ranked party school.
[00:26:03] So party implies party doesn't imply birthday cake.
[00:26:07] A party party party implies drinking getting crazy.
[00:26:12] Yeah.
[00:26:13] But which is different.
[00:26:15] Getting crazy is different from getting nuts, right?
[00:26:17] Not getting nuts is fighting.
[00:26:18] Yeah.
[00:26:19] Getting nuts is fighting.
[00:26:20] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:26:23] All right, so we're just talking about getting crazy and partying.
[00:26:27] And that's what these guys were doing.
[00:26:28] Getting after it.
[00:26:29] Yeah.
[00:26:30] So here we go back to the book.
[00:26:31] We were impatient.
[00:26:32] We were wound up.
[00:26:33] We could know more relaxed than we could think.
[00:26:36] In those days, there was not an introspective person among us.
[00:26:40] We seldom spoke of the war, except as it might relate to ourselves and an abstract
[00:26:46] way.
[00:26:47] The ethics of Hitler, the extermination of the Jews, the yellow peril, these were matters
[00:26:52] for the gentleman of the editorial pages to discuss.
[00:26:56] We lived for thrills.
[00:26:58] Not the thrills of the battlefield, but of the speeding auto, the dimly lighted cafe,
[00:27:04] the drink racing, the blood, the texture of a cheek, the sheen of a silk and calf.
[00:27:11] Nothing was permitted to last.
[00:27:14] All had to be fluid.
[00:27:15] We wanted not actuality, but possibility.
[00:27:21] That's pretty interesting statement.
[00:27:23] We all had to be fluid.
[00:27:24] We wanted not actually, they didn't actually want that.
[00:27:26] They wanted to chase that right.
[00:27:30] We could not be still.
[00:27:31] Always movement, everything changing.
[00:27:33] We were like shadows, fleeing, ever fleeing, condemned men, souls in hell.
[00:27:44] Soon the spate of 62 hour liberties was ended, mid May of 1942, saw me go home for the
[00:27:50] last time.
[00:27:51] My family would not set eyes on me again for nearly three years.
[00:28:02] And again, obviously there's some very important experiences in that section.
[00:28:11] That's why you read the book.
[00:28:15] It's great to hear his perspective.
[00:28:16] You're going to see Robert Lecky, he's a very intelligent.
[00:28:22] He became a writer.
[00:28:23] He became a writer.
[00:28:24] This isn't the only book.
[00:28:25] He wrote 40 plus books in his life.
[00:28:27] He worked for big newspapers.
[00:28:30] He's a writer.
[00:28:31] He's a very smart guy.
[00:28:34] He talks about that and we'll get to that point here.
[00:28:37] That's why his perspective is so interesting.
[00:28:40] He brings a lot of that in this book.
[00:28:45] But eventually, obviously they finished their training.
[00:28:48] No more partying.
[00:28:50] And now it's time to fight.
[00:28:54] Back to the book.
[00:28:55] Fires flickered on the shores of Guadalcanal Island when we came on the deck.
[00:29:02] They were not great flaming, leaping fires and we were disappointed.
[00:29:06] We'd expected to see the world a light when we emerged from the hatches.
[00:29:10] The bombardment had seemed fierce.
[00:29:12] Our modda for such we judged it to be seemed capable of blasting Guadalcanal into
[00:29:20] tradition.
[00:29:23] But in the dirty dawn of August 7th, 1942, there were only a few fires flickering like
[00:29:28] the city dumps to light our path to history.
[00:29:33] We were apprehensive, not frightened.
[00:29:37] So in case you haven't gathered, these guys are about to do the landing at Guadalcanal.
[00:29:46] And they get into the little Higgins boats, the landing craft.
[00:29:52] And here we go.
[00:29:53] The assault began.
[00:29:54] Now I was praying again.
[00:29:55] I had prayed much the night before, carefully, deliberately, in, in, in, in, in, in,
[00:30:00] perpetrating God and the virgin to care for my family and friends should I fall.
[00:30:06] In the vanity of youth, I was positive I would die.
[00:30:10] In the same vanity, I was turning my affairs over to the Almighty.
[00:30:17] And I think what he means by vanity that he was sure he would die, you'd think, oh, somebody
[00:30:22] that's vain, it would be like, hey, I can't be killed.
[00:30:25] But I think what he means by that is the vanity that there's some determined outcome that
[00:30:31] you can control or that there's that there's that there's some way it's going to go.
[00:30:37] Like he's going to die.
[00:30:38] No, you don't even know that.
[00:30:39] Right, right, it's that he knows, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:30:42] I know what's going to happen.
[00:30:43] I know I'm going to die.
[00:30:44] That's vanity and it's on right.
[00:30:45] That's what he said.
[00:30:49] So they hit the landing back to the book, but there was no fight.
[00:30:54] The Japanese had run from somewhere, came the command, move out.
[00:31:00] We formed staggered squads and slogged off.
[00:31:04] We left our innocence on red beach.
[00:31:08] It would never be the same.
[00:31:15] They spend a night.
[00:31:18] They're they're not patrolling in and in the night.
[00:31:22] They're in security positions and they hear a little gunfire and we're going to the book.
[00:31:27] At dawn, we learned the import of the gunfire.
[00:31:30] Medical corpsman had been killed.
[00:31:32] He had been shot by his own men.
[00:31:35] When the century had challenged him as he returned from relieving himself, he had boggled
[00:31:39] over the past word, little a fusion.
[00:31:43] And so met death.
[00:31:46] It turned to be at the mercy of a liquid continent.
[00:31:51] Now, little heads up, little a fusion is not a good challenge and reply password for everyone.
[00:31:58] You don't want to come up with something that's not totally obvious, but don't make
[00:32:03] a guy that's scared out in the middle of the jungle, remember the word, little a fusion.
[00:32:11] And you know, we talk about blue one blue.
[00:32:12] There you go.
[00:32:13] Like their first casualties, blue one blue.
[00:32:15] Their first casualty is blue one blue.
[00:32:17] Their first casualties are a medic, a corpsman being killed by centuries.
[00:32:21] That's a nightmare.
[00:32:25] And I wasn't going to read this but I'm going to.
[00:32:30] I peered at the captain.
[00:32:31] Anxiety was on his face as though carved there by the night's events.
[00:32:36] It startled me.
[00:32:38] Here was no warrior, no veteran of a hundred battles.
[00:32:41] Here was only a civilian like myself.
[00:32:44] He was a man hardly more confident than the trigger happy century who had killed the
[00:32:48] corpsman.
[00:32:49] He was much older than I, but the responsibility of his charge, the unknown face of war,
[00:32:55] had frightened him past trusting the evidence of his senses.
[00:33:00] So imagine you're going into combat.
[00:33:02] You're in charge.
[00:33:03] You're a civilian, but now you're in charge.
[00:33:05] And you're going out on your first combat patrol.
[00:33:06] You lay up and your first thing you do is you kill one of your own guys kills.
[00:33:09] One of your other guys.
[00:33:12] There's a nightmare and he can see it on his face.
[00:33:18] They spend the rest of the day out there still no heavy enemy contact back to the book.
[00:33:24] That day was a dull lost witness to the cycle of the sun of which I have neither memory,
[00:33:30] nor regret.
[00:33:32] The night I shall never forget.
[00:33:34] I awoke in the middle of it to see the sky on fire.
[00:33:38] So it seemed.
[00:33:39] It was like the red mist of my childhood dream when I imagined judgment to have come,
[00:33:43] while I played baseball on the castle grounds at home.
[00:33:47] We were bathed in red light as though fixed in the eye of Satan.
[00:33:52] Imagine a myriad of red traffic lights glowing in the rain and you will have a replica
[00:33:57] of the world in which I awoke.
[00:34:00] The lights were the flares of the enemy.
[00:34:03] They hung above the jungle roof, swaying gently on their parachutes, casting their red
[00:34:08] glow about.
[00:34:10] Motors throbbed above.
[00:34:11] They were those of Japanese sea planes we learned later.
[00:34:15] We thought they were hunting us.
[00:34:17] But they were actually the eyes of a mighty enemy naval armata that swept into sea
[00:34:23] Clark channel.
[00:34:25] Soon we heard the sound of cannons and the island trembled beneath us.
[00:34:31] There came flashes of light, white and red and great rocking explosions.
[00:34:36] The japs were hammering out one of their greatest naval victories.
[00:34:42] It was the Battle of Savo Island.
[00:34:44] What we learned to call more accurately the Battle of Forests sitting ducks.
[00:34:50] They were sinking three American cruisers.
[00:34:52] The Quincy, Vincent's and Astoria and one Australian cruiser, the Canberra.
[00:35:00] As well as damaging one other American cruiser and a US destroyer.
[00:35:08] And so they then during this they moved towards the beach.
[00:35:13] And here we go.
[00:35:14] It was dusk when we reached the beach.
[00:35:17] We saw wrecked and smoking ships, a clean, unshipped expanse of water between Guadalcanal
[00:35:23] and Florida Island.
[00:35:25] Our navy was gone.
[00:35:28] Gone.
[00:35:29] So, if you don't know anything about the Pacific campaign, you're taking down islands.
[00:35:38] And your lifeline is the navy.
[00:35:41] Because that's who's going to bring you ammunition, food, water, gun support, fire support.
[00:35:46] That's where you're going to take your casualties.
[00:35:49] So you have total reliance on the navy.
[00:35:52] And these guys wake up in the morning and the navy's gone.
[00:35:56] Other than sunken ships.
[00:35:59] And what can they do?
[00:36:04] There's no way to run to.
[00:36:06] You can't back, you can't, there's no way to go.
[00:36:08] The navy's gone.
[00:36:10] So they get ordered to take up position where they think an attack might come from.
[00:36:18] And here we go back to the book.
[00:36:20] We were ordered up from the beach to new positions on the west bank of the Teneru River.
[00:36:26] The orders commanded us to urgency.
[00:36:29] The enemy was expected.
[00:36:33] The Teneru River laid green and evil like a serpent across the pome coastal plain.
[00:36:40] It was called a river, but it was not a river like most of the streams of Oceana.
[00:36:44] It was a creek, not 30 yards wide.
[00:36:47] So they're placed there to set security.
[00:36:51] And they're there for a while.
[00:36:53] And finally, one night, here we go back to the book.
[00:36:58] A man says of the eruption of battle, all hell broke loose.
[00:37:03] The first time he says it, it is true, wonderfully descriptive.
[00:37:09] The millionth time it has said, it has been worn into meaninglessness.
[00:37:14] It has gone the way of all good phrasing.
[00:37:17] It has become cliche.
[00:37:21] But within five minutes of that first machine gun burst of the appearance of that first
[00:37:26] enemy flare that's infused the battlefield in unersely green, greenish light.
[00:37:31] And by its dying, accentuated the re-inveloping night, within five minutes of this, all
[00:37:38] hell broke loose.
[00:37:41] Everyone was firing, every weapon was sounding voice.
[00:37:44] But this was no orchestration, notably beautiful symphony of death, as decadent
[00:37:50] we're echelon observers right.
[00:37:52] Here was a cacophony.
[00:37:55] Here was a cacophony.
[00:37:56] Here was dissonance.
[00:37:58] Here was wildness.
[00:37:59] Here was the absence of rhythm, the loss of limit for fires.
[00:38:06] What when and where he chooses.
[00:38:11] Here was booming, sounding, shrinking, wailing, hissing, crashing, shaking, gibberish
[00:38:18] and noise.
[00:38:22] Here was hell.
[00:38:25] It is odd with what clarity the trained ear distinguishes each one and catalogs it, plucks
[00:38:31] it out of the general den, even though it is intermingled with coincidental with the voice
[00:38:37] of a dozen others.
[00:38:39] Even though one's own machine gun spits and coughs and dances and shakes in caloric fury.
[00:38:47] So it was that our ears prickled at strange new sounds.
[00:38:53] The lighter, shingle-snap and crack of the Japanese rifle, the gargle of their extremely
[00:38:59] fast machine guns, the hiccup of their light mortars.
[00:39:07] And by the way, the movie, the Pacific, or the series, the Pacific, shows the battle
[00:39:12] scenes of the tender we river and their phenomenal.
[00:39:15] They do a great job of representing what he's talking about right there.
[00:39:20] Back to the book, we dive for our holes and gun positions.
[00:39:23] I jump to the gun with which chocolate and eye had left standing on the bank.
[00:39:30] I unclamp the gun and fired, spraying my shots as though I are handling a hose.
[00:39:35] But one fell.
[00:39:36] The first fell, as though his under part had been cut from him by a scythe and the
[00:39:43] others fell tumbling, screaming.
[00:39:46] Once again, our gun collapsed and I grabbed a rifle.
[00:39:48] I remembered had no sling which had been left near the gun.
[00:39:53] The jab, who had survived, who had survived was deep in the coconuts by the time I found
[00:39:58] him in the rifle sites.
[00:40:00] There was his back, bobbing large and he seemed to be throwing his pack away.
[00:40:06] Then I fired and he wasn't there anymore.
[00:40:10] Perhaps it was not eye who shot him, but everyone had found their senses for not everyone
[00:40:15] had found their senses and their weapons by then.
[00:40:18] But I boasted that I had.
[00:40:20] Perhaps too, it was a merciful bullet that pounded him between the shoulder blades for
[00:40:26] he was fleeing to a certain and horrible end.
[00:40:30] Black knights, hunger and slow dissolution in the rain for us.
[00:40:37] But I had not thought of mercy then.
[00:40:40] Modern war went forward in the jungle.
[00:40:43] Men of the first battalion were cleaning up.
[00:40:45] Sometimes they drove a Japanese toward us.
[00:40:48] He would cower on the riverbank, hiding on a wear that opposite him were we.
[00:40:54] Already the victors, numerous heavily armed, lusting for more blood.
[00:41:01] We killed a few more this way.
[00:41:04] The fever was on us.
[00:41:11] Yet it's interesting that he's looking back and thinking to himself that when he kills
[00:41:16] this Japanese soldier, that was a merciful thing to do.
[00:41:21] Because he didn't suffer yet.
[00:41:23] They've been on the island for a few days, even though they're scared, even though
[00:41:26] they've received fire.
[00:41:27] They haven't gone to the full length of suffering that they're going to go through.
[00:41:32] So in the battles over, and leki gives everyone in the book, he just gives them these
[00:41:39] really kind of easy to understand nicknames based on their personality.
[00:41:46] So he talks about this guy here who he calls Lieutenant Ivy League, which doesn't take
[00:41:52] a lot of explanation to picture what that guy is like.
[00:41:55] So here we go back to the book.
[00:41:56] Lieutenant Ivy League strode up to our pits in the morning.
[00:42:00] So this is the battles over.
[00:42:01] He sat on a coconut log and told us what had happened.
[00:42:05] He smoked desperately and stared into the river as he talked.
[00:42:10] The skin around his eyes was drawn tight with strain and with shock.
[00:42:14] His eyes had already taken on that aspect peculiar to Guadalcanal, that constant stare of pupils
[00:42:22] that seemed darker, larger, rounder, more absolute.
[00:42:27] And he kind of gives him a debrief on what happened with the battle that where the Japanese
[00:42:33] had come from.
[00:42:34] And then he says, when he spoke again, it was to tell us who had been killed.
[00:42:40] There were more than a dozen from age company besides more than a score of wounded.
[00:42:47] Four or five of the dead were from our platoon.
[00:42:51] Two of them had been hacked to death.
[00:42:54] A Japanese scouting party had found them asleep in their hole on the riverbank and sliced
[00:43:00] them into pieces.
[00:43:04] Our regimen had killed something like 900 of them.
[00:43:09] Most of them lay in clusters or in heaps before the gun pits commanding the sand spit.
[00:43:16] As though they had not died singly, but in groups.
[00:43:22] One of them reeds went methodically among the dead armed with a pair of pliers.
[00:43:27] He had observed that the Japanese have a penchant for gold fillings in their teeth, often
[00:43:31] for solid gold teeth.
[00:43:34] He was looting their very mouths.
[00:43:37] He would kick their jaws a gap, peer into the mouth with all the solicitude of a park
[00:43:42] avenue dentist, careful, always careful not to contaminate himself by touch.
[00:43:49] And he ain't got all the glittered.
[00:43:52] He kept the gold teeth in an empty bull Durham tobacco sack, which he wore around his neck.
[00:44:00] Souvenirs.
[00:44:01] We called him.
[00:44:02] So that's another nickname he gave, they called this guy Souvenirs.
[00:44:09] Now they're suholing in that position.
[00:44:13] And for a few nights while they were holding this position on the river, they would see
[00:44:17] they didn't know what it was.
[00:44:19] They would see sort of a V in the calm water.
[00:44:23] They would see like a V, a disturbance in the water.
[00:44:25] And they couldn't figure out what it was.
[00:44:27] They were scared out of the couple times.
[00:44:28] They shot towards it.
[00:44:29] They didn't know what it was.
[00:44:30] They thought it was a spire or a scout trying to check them out.
[00:44:35] But they were crocodiles.
[00:44:39] Back to the book.
[00:44:40] I took the glasses from him and focused on the opposite shore where I saw crocodile eating the
[00:44:45] fat Japanese.
[00:44:48] I watched into based fascination, but when the crocodile began to tug at the intestines,
[00:44:53] I recalled my own presence in that very river hardly an hour ago.
[00:44:58] And my knees went weak and I relinquished the glasses.
[00:45:03] That night the V reappared in the river.
[00:45:05] So they could see the little ripple in the river.
[00:45:09] Everyone whooped and hollered.
[00:45:11] No one fired.
[00:45:12] We knew what it was.
[00:45:14] The crocodile.
[00:45:15] Three smaller Vs trailed afterwards.
[00:45:19] And there's even more crocodiles coming.
[00:45:23] They kept us awake, crunching.
[00:45:26] The smell kept us awake.
[00:45:28] Even though we lay with our head swath in a blanket, which was now, which was how we kept
[00:45:33] off the mosquitoes, the smell overpowered us.
[00:45:38] The sense which somehow seems a joke is the one most susceptible to outrage.
[00:45:45] It will give you no rest.
[00:45:48] One can close one's eyes to ugliness or shield the ears from sound, but from a powerful
[00:45:53] smell there is no recourse but flight.
[00:45:58] Then since we could not flee, we could not escape this smell and we could not sleep.
[00:46:05] We never fired at the crocodiles, though they returned to the repost day after day until
[00:46:10] the remains were removed to mass burning and burial, which served as a funeral pyre for
[00:46:16] the enemy.
[00:46:17] We had annihilated.
[00:46:26] Our victory in the fight, which we called the Battle of Hell's Point, was not so great
[00:46:31] as we had imagined it to be.
[00:46:35] It was to be one of the many fights for Guadalcanal, and in the end not the foremost of them.
[00:46:41] But being the first in our experience, we took it for total triumph.
[00:46:46] Like those who take the present for the best of all worlds, having no reference to the
[00:46:51] past, nor regard for the future.
[00:46:55] As a mistake, we all make something good happens and you think you're the victor.
[00:47:04] On the high plateau of triumph, we were about to descend into the depths of trial and
[00:47:10] tedium.
[00:47:11] The Japanese attack was to be redoubled and prolonged and varied.
[00:47:15] They would come from the sky, the sea, and the land.
[00:47:18] In between every trial, there would stretch out the tedium that sucks a man dry drawing
[00:47:24] off the juice from body and soul as a native removes the contents of a stick of sugarcane,
[00:47:31] giving it spent, cracked, good for nothing but the flames.
[00:47:38] And there is terror coming from the interaction of trial and tedium.
[00:47:45] The first shaking a man as the wind in the treetops, the second eroding him as the flood
[00:47:52] at the roots.
[00:47:53] So he's got these two things that are working on him.
[00:47:57] The trail, which is the actual fighting, the actual attacks and tedium, which is the boredom
[00:48:02] in the waiting.
[00:48:05] And again, if you watch the Pacific, it does a great job of showing this and one of the things
[00:48:11] that really got me when I watched that for the first time is it shows this landing and
[00:48:15] there's nothing happening.
[00:48:17] Then you're waiting for it to happen.
[00:48:19] Then you know it's going to happen and you're waiting for it.
[00:48:22] And that was a real, that, that, that, that, I remember that feeling.
[00:48:27] Of being in the streets and you're waiting for it to happen and you're just waiting.
[00:48:31] And it's a, you want it to happen.
[00:48:34] Because then you can go.
[00:48:35] Yeah.
[00:48:36] Let's get it over.
[00:48:37] Yeah.
[00:48:38] But here's, he's describing it as like a tree being eroded.
[00:48:41] So the first shaking a man as the wind in the treetops, the second.
[00:48:47] So that's, that's what, that's what the, the actual thing does to you, shakes you around.
[00:48:51] But the tedium, the second, that's the tedium eroding him as the flood.
[00:48:57] At the roots.
[00:48:58] Each fresh trial leaves a man more shaken than the last and each period of tedium with
[00:49:04] its time for speculative dread.
[00:49:09] Leaves his foundations worn lower, his roots less firm for the next trial.
[00:49:16] Sometimes there is a final shattering, a man crouching in a pit beneath the bombardment
[00:49:22] of a battleship might put a pistol to his head and deliver himself.
[00:49:30] Sometimes it is partial.
[00:49:32] Another man might break at the sound of a diving enemy plane and scream and shutter
[00:49:38] and ring his hands and rise to run.
[00:49:43] This is the terror I meant.
[00:49:45] This is the terror that strangles reason with the clawing hands of panic.
[00:49:52] I saw it twice.
[00:49:53] I felt it plucked at me twice, but it was rare.
[00:49:57] It claimed few victims.
[00:50:01] So that's a really, I think that's just a phenomenal way to understand what these guys were
[00:50:08] going through.
[00:50:10] The waiting and then the trial and then the waiting and then the trial.
[00:50:16] And that's a great description.
[00:50:18] The speculative dread, just thinking about, okay, what's the next attack going to be
[00:50:24] like, are we going to be able to get through it?
[00:50:28] And you know, he's talking about guys killing themselves.
[00:50:30] Being so, they just can't take it anymore.
[00:50:34] They can't take it anymore.
[00:50:37] And the only way out they can figure is to kill themselves, which is just a horrible, horrible
[00:50:45] thing.
[00:50:46] Sometimes criminals will do that.
[00:50:48] Like if they're on a budget if they're on the run.
[00:50:50] True.
[00:50:51] And they're like, when are they going to break down my door and find me and they get that speculative
[00:50:56] dread and they just turn themselves in?
[00:50:58] Right.
[00:50:59] Or I thought you were going to say that sometimes you know, guys want their surrounded
[00:51:03] by the SWAT team.
[00:51:04] Oh yeah, then they just know they just can't take anymore of the guilt themselves.
[00:51:07] Yeah, I feel like that's more of them.
[00:51:10] I'd rather dive and go to jail almost.
[00:51:11] True.
[00:51:12] But speculative dread.
[00:51:13] Are you talking about?
[00:51:14] Yeah.
[00:51:15] Because it's the tournaments, you know, when you're winning around like, oh, and my
[00:51:19] up in my up, that's like, can be part of the chat.
[00:51:21] I mean, waiting.
[00:51:22] Yeah, you're waiting.
[00:51:23] I mean, obviously, we're late harder than this.
[00:51:24] But this.
[00:51:26] And he, so he says this and he says it, it claimed few victims, meaning it didn't actually
[00:51:33] most guys sucked it up.
[00:51:35] And you're going to hear him.
[00:51:36] You know, because he says he felt it twice.
[00:51:39] It plucked at him twice.
[00:51:42] But it wasn't, it was rare.
[00:51:45] He says it, but it was rare.
[00:51:46] And then he says courage was commonplace.
[00:51:49] So that was what was normal.
[00:51:51] It was normal.
[00:51:52] It was courage.
[00:51:54] And this is just such a good paragraph or two here.
[00:51:59] Courage was a commonplace.
[00:52:01] It formed a club or corporation, much as do those other common things upon which men
[00:52:08] for diverse reasons, play so great of value, like money, like charity.
[00:52:15] Courage is in the common on which the exclusive rests.
[00:52:21] Our muddy machine gun pits were transformed into courage clubs.
[00:52:27] When bombs fell or Japanese worships pounded us from the sea.
[00:52:32] It was protocol to be observed too.
[00:52:34] And it was natural that the poor fellow who might break into momentary terror should cause
[00:52:41] pain, silences and embarrassed coughs.
[00:52:45] Everyone looked the other way, like millionaires confronted by the horrifying sight of
[00:52:51] a club member borrowing $5 from the waiter.
[00:52:56] And then he says this, but there was a bit more charity in our clubs, I think.
[00:53:02] We were not quite so puffed up that we could not recognize the ugly thing on our
[00:53:08] friends face as the elder brother of the thing fluttering within our own inwards.
[00:53:19] You today, me tomorrow.
[00:53:24] And that's such a powerful thing to think about.
[00:53:28] When you see someone going through some trouble to be able to recognize like, hey, you
[00:53:33] know, echoes going through some issues right now.
[00:53:36] And I'm not looking down at you.
[00:53:39] I'm not judging you.
[00:53:40] I'm recognizing that what you're going through today could be what I go through tomorrow.
[00:53:45] And they all felt, he felt that, you know, I see echo losing it and curling into a ball
[00:53:50] and not wanting to fight.
[00:53:52] And I recognize that as the older brother of the thing that I actually feel too.
[00:53:57] But I've got it under control today.
[00:54:00] Tomorrow I'm not patrera.
[00:54:01] I got it under control.
[00:54:02] That's why I'm not looking down my nose at you.
[00:54:05] And that's why I'm not judging you.
[00:54:06] And I think that forms such a tight bond that these guys had, you know, these guys had
[00:54:14] respect enough respect and enough mercy on each other to say, look, that goes out
[00:54:20] an hour and a time right now.
[00:54:21] It's okay.
[00:54:22] We're going to get him through today.
[00:54:24] I'm not going to look down on him.
[00:54:27] And tomorrow it might be me.
[00:54:28] And he's not going to look down on me.
[00:54:31] Powerful stuff.
[00:54:32] We tend to judge.
[00:54:34] Yeah, especially.
[00:54:35] Yeah, it seems like they can relate, you know, like echoes at level eight right now.
[00:54:40] He's losing it.
[00:54:41] I'm over at level two.
[00:54:43] And luckily I can keep the two inside, you know.
[00:54:46] But I don't even know when two's going to come out.
[00:54:48] Yes, it was at one.
[00:54:49] So I could very well be it, you know, but that idea that when you're dealing with other
[00:54:54] people, you try and have their perspective.
[00:54:58] You try and take their perspective and understand what they're going through and have
[00:55:01] empathy for what's happening to them.
[00:55:03] Oh, powerful.
[00:55:04] Yeah.
[00:55:05] Instead, we tend so often just to want a judge.
[00:55:10] Yeah.
[00:55:12] Judge.
[00:55:17] Back to the book.
[00:55:18] At night, washing machine Charlie picked up the slack.
[00:55:22] Washing machine Charlie, so named for the sound of his motors, was the nocturnal
[00:55:28] morerger who prowled our skies.
[00:55:31] So these are Japanese bombers.
[00:55:36] Like the dog whose bark is worse than it's bite, the throb of Charlie's motors was more
[00:55:40] fearsome than thump of his bombs.
[00:55:44] Charlie did not kill many people, but like McBeth, he murdered sleep.
[00:55:52] To these trials was added the worst ordeal, shelling from the sea.
[00:55:57] Many warships usually cruisers, sometimes battleships stand off your coast.
[00:56:03] It is night and you cannot see them nor could you if it were day as their miles and miles
[00:56:09] away.
[00:56:11] We could see the flashes of the guns far out to sea.
[00:56:14] We heard the soft papoon, papoon of their salvos.
[00:56:20] And rushing through the night, straining like an airy box car came the huge projectiles.
[00:56:28] The earth rocks and shakes upon the terrifying crash of the detonation.
[00:56:32] Though it would be hundreds of yards away, your stomach is squeezed as though a monster
[00:56:38] a monster hand were needing it into dough.
[00:56:43] You grab gas for breath like a football player who falls heavily and has the wind knocked
[00:56:47] out of him.
[00:56:49] Flash, papoon.
[00:56:53] They are loing their sights.
[00:56:54] It is coming closer.
[00:56:55] Oh, that one is close.
[00:56:56] The sandbags are falling.
[00:56:58] I can't hear it.
[00:56:59] I can't hear the shell.
[00:57:00] It is the one you don't hear, they say.
[00:57:01] The one you don't hear.
[00:57:03] Where is it?
[00:57:04] Where is it?
[00:57:05] Flash, papoon.
[00:57:06] Thank God.
[00:57:08] It is lifted.
[00:57:09] It is going the other way.
[00:57:13] This day light now and they are only the bombings to worry about and the heat and the mosquitoes.
[00:57:19] And the rice lying in our bellies like stones.
[00:57:28] So again, the unknown and uncontrollable experience of getting hit with mortars or artillery
[00:57:36] in this case, naval gunfire.
[00:57:39] And again, there is no US Navy out there.
[00:57:41] They are just having their way.
[00:57:42] It is a nightmare.
[00:57:47] They continue to press on, but things are not looking good back to the book.
[00:57:52] Everyone kept saying, hopefully, that the Army was coming in next week to relieve us.
[00:57:58] Everyone was in despair.
[00:58:00] We heard that the Army relief force had been destroyed at sea.
[00:58:05] Chocolate and I visited the cemetery.
[00:58:08] It lay to the south off the coastal road that ran from east to west through the coconuts.
[00:58:14] We knelt to prey before the graves of the men we had known.
[00:58:18] Only palm fronds marked the place where they were buried, although here and there were
[00:58:23] rude crosses on which were nailed the men's identification tags.
[00:58:31] Some of the crosses bore mess, gear tins, a fixed to the wood like rude medallions and
[00:58:38] on those the marines had lovingly carved their epitaphs.
[00:58:43] He died fighting.
[00:58:47] A real marine, a big guy with a bigger heart, our buddy.
[00:58:57] The harder the going, the more cheerful he was.
[00:59:04] There was also this verse which I had seen countless times before and since the direct
[00:59:10] and unpolished cry of a marine, sardonic heart.
[00:59:15] When he gets to heaven, so same Peter he will tell one more marine reporting, sir, I've
[00:59:23] served my time in hell.
[00:59:31] Now part of that despair that they felt came from the fact that they began to feel
[00:59:45] expendable.
[00:59:48] Then he goes into that here.
[00:59:50] All armies have expendable items.
[00:59:53] That is a part or unit, the destruction of which will not be fatal to the whole.
[00:59:58] And some more deals a man might consider his finger expendable, but not his hand, or an
[01:00:03] extremity his arm, but not his heart.
[01:00:07] There are expendable items which may be lost or destroyed in the field either in war or
[01:00:12] in peace without their owner being required to replace them.
[01:00:17] A rifle is so expendable or a cartridge belt.
[01:00:22] So are men, men are the most expendable of all hunger, the jungle, the Japanese, not one,
[01:00:32] nor all of these could be quite as corrosive as the feeling of expendability.
[01:00:40] This was no feeling of dedication because it was absolutely involuntary.
[01:00:46] I do not doubt that if Marines had asked for volunteers for an impossible campaign such as
[01:00:52] Grotto Canal, almost everyone now fighting would have stepped forward.
[01:00:57] But that is sacrifice, that is voluntary.
[01:01:01] Being expended robs you of that exaltation, the self-abnegation, the absolute freedom of self-sacrifice,
[01:01:14] being expended puts one in the role of victim rather than sacrificeer.
[01:01:21] And there is always something begrudging in this.
[01:01:29] So luckily they do end up getting some help, getting relieved.
[01:01:39] The army shows up to help them out and here we go.
[01:01:43] So we were glad to see the soldiers when they came, trudging up to our pits.
[01:01:48] They came after another air raid, a very close one, but the thing had not infected them yet.
[01:01:55] War was still a lurk.
[01:01:57] Their faces were still heavy with flesh, their ribs padded, their eyes innocent.
[01:02:04] They were older than we, and averaged 25 to our average 20.
[01:02:10] Yet we treated them like children.
[01:02:17] Now even though they get relieved, they're still working and still fighting.
[01:02:23] And they're still suffering.
[01:02:25] Back to the book we were growing irritable.
[01:02:28] Our strength was being steadily sapped and a sort of physical depression afflicted many
[01:02:33] of us.
[01:02:35] The reign, the rainy season was upon us.
[01:02:38] On our exposed ridge, it fell upon us in torrents.
[01:02:42] The man was drenched in seconds, his teeth chattering at his hands darting swiftly to his precious
[01:02:47] cigarettes, transferring them to the safety of his helmet liner, cursing bitterly if he had
[01:02:51] waited too long before becoming conscious of their peril.
[01:02:56] After cigarettes, we were concerned about our ammunition.
[01:03:00] On the downward slope of the hill, the rain water ran into our pits and holes, as though
[01:03:04] they were sewer receivers.
[01:03:06] We had to dash for the pits and lift the boxes of machine gun belts out of the water's
[01:03:10] way, piling them atop on another on the earth and gun platform.
[01:03:16] Any dry place in the pit was reserved for ammunition.
[01:03:20] He who sought refuge from the rain had to sit on the water cans.
[01:03:26] There were whole days of downpour where I lay drenched in shivering, glazing, blankly out
[01:03:31] of my whole, watching as the sheeded gray rain whipped and the undulated over the ridge.
[01:03:40] That such times a man's brain seems to cease to function.
[01:03:45] It seems to retreat into a depth, much as the red core puzzles retreat from the surface
[01:03:50] of the body and times of excitement.
[01:03:53] One ceases to be rational, one becomes only sedentant, like a barnacle, clinging onto
[01:04:00] a ship.
[01:04:02] One is aware only of life, of wetness, of the cold gray rain.
[01:04:09] But without this automatic retreat of reasons, a man can go only one way.
[01:04:17] He can only go mad.
[01:04:23] Sort of level of detachment there.
[01:04:25] Just checking out.
[01:04:27] Just checking out.
[01:04:28] You're just there, but you're not there.
[01:04:31] Good place to visit sometimes.
[01:04:35] You know, I don't think you want to live there.
[01:04:37] You certainly don't want to live there, but it's a good place to visit.
[01:04:41] Why?
[01:04:42] I just think it's important to get to a point where you're just attaching from your physical
[01:04:48] suffering and your physical pain.
[01:04:49] And you just say, you know what?
[01:04:51] I'm just turned off.
[01:04:52] And you just retreat, like he said, you just retreat into almost like nothingness.
[01:04:57] I think it's important.
[01:04:59] I think to gain clarity or something.
[01:05:01] Yeah, I think you gain some clarity.
[01:05:03] And I think it's a very important defense mechanism to have.
[01:05:06] Oh, yeah.
[01:05:07] You know, sometimes when you're doing stuff, you just have to do it.
[01:05:12] Like you can't think about anymore.
[01:05:13] You just have to turn your brain off and go.
[01:05:16] And I think that's what he's talking about right there.
[01:05:19] He's not participating in it.
[01:05:21] He's just attaching from it and doing what he's got to do.
[01:05:24] His body is doing what he's got to do.
[01:05:29] Now, they're this whole time they're expecting to be relieved.
[01:05:39] They're expecting to get pulled off the island.
[01:05:43] And one of the sergeants comes out and makes an announcement to them.
[01:05:48] Stand by to move out in the morning.
[01:05:50] Yeah, we move it out into a new offensive.
[01:05:56] Get all your foul weather gear ready and be sure your guns is oiled.
[01:05:59] Up in the ammunition belts dry.
[01:06:02] Eight Marines will be up to relieve us in the morning.
[01:06:07] So they think they're going to get relieved and go to a ship and relax and get, get into,
[01:06:14] get some relief.
[01:06:15] That's what relieve is, right?
[01:06:17] But they get told, no, you're going on a new offensive.
[01:06:21] So they're in, well, here, going back to the book.
[01:06:24] After nearly five months.
[01:06:27] By the way, a lot of times you think of the island campaigns Japan.
[01:06:29] These are little islands.
[01:06:30] You know, 10 miles long.
[01:06:32] You think all that probably took a week, two weeks, five months.
[01:06:37] After nearly five months, this runner and he's going to name all the different guys
[01:06:43] a different nickname you can hear.
[01:06:45] Runner had malaria.
[01:06:47] Brick barely stirred from the pit except at night.
[01:06:50] Who's your an oak stump or subject to long periods of depression?
[01:06:54] Head and long since left us, I had dysentery, chocolate was irritable.
[01:06:59] All of us were initiated and weakened beyond measure.
[01:07:04] But we were to move out on the attack.
[01:07:07] We could not move the chow without gasping for breath, but we were to move on the enemy.
[01:07:15] We disperseed.
[01:07:17] In the morning, we crouched by our guns and waited for the order to dismantle them and
[01:07:21] move out.
[01:07:24] It did not come.
[01:07:26] Norded to come the next day or the next and hope came creeping back blushing, ashamed
[01:07:31] of her loyal, disloyal flight, but commending herself to us once more with the promise
[01:07:37] never again to desert the ramparts.
[01:07:42] Then one morning, the word came to move out.
[01:07:46] Sergeant Dandy gave it to us.
[01:07:49] Heaf the guns behind, he said, take only your rifles and foul weather geared.
[01:07:55] He grinned.
[01:07:56] We're being relieved.
[01:07:58] He was December 14, 1942.
[01:08:02] We had been on the lines without relief since August 7th.
[01:08:08] My battalion, the second battalion, first regiment, was the last of those in the first
[01:08:13] marine division to come out of the lines.
[01:08:18] The battle canal was over.
[01:08:21] We had won.
[01:08:25] And next, they get pulled back off the island now and he's climbing aboard the ship of the
[01:08:34] board cargo nets.
[01:08:37] He's exhausted.
[01:08:38] I was able to reach the top of the net but go no further.
[01:08:41] I could not muster the strength to swing over the gunnel and I hung there breathing heavily.
[01:08:47] The ship's hot side swaying away from me in the swells.
[01:08:50] The very predition, lapping beneath me until two sailors grabbed me out of the armpits
[01:08:55] and pulled me over.
[01:08:57] I fell with a clatter among the others who had been so brought aboard and I lay with
[01:09:01] my cheek pressed against the warm, grimy deck, my heart beating rapidly, not from this
[01:09:07] exercise.
[01:09:10] But from happiness.
[01:09:14] He ends up having a sailor, a conversation, him and his buddy Chockler, who's like one of his
[01:09:20] best friends, they are end up having a conversation with one of the sailors.
[01:09:28] And he says the soldier seems to be surprised.
[01:09:30] He says, you mean Guadalcanal.
[01:09:32] He says, was it rough?
[01:09:35] How was it?
[01:09:36] Rough?
[01:09:38] Rough we answered mechanically.
[01:09:40] Then Chockler spoke up.
[01:09:41] You mean Guadalcanal?
[01:09:44] The soldier seemed surprised.
[01:09:46] The conversation with the soldier that was on the ship that hadn't been in Guadalcanal.
[01:09:51] The soldier seemed surprised.
[01:09:52] Of course I do.
[01:09:53] Chockler hastened to explain.
[01:09:55] I wasn't being wise.
[01:09:56] I meant, had you ever heard of the place before you got here?
[01:10:00] He's astonishment startled us.
[01:10:03] An idea was dawning.
[01:10:05] You mean, how, yes, Guadalcanal, the first Marines, everybody's hurt.
[01:10:11] You guys are famous.
[01:10:14] You guys are heroes back home.
[01:10:17] We did not see him leave for we had both looked away quickly.
[01:10:21] Each embarrassed by the quick tears.
[01:10:25] They had not forgotten.
[01:10:29] And again, I kind of breeze through that park in the book.
[01:10:35] But a lot of times when they were in those moments of despair, they'd be thinking, no
[01:10:38] one knows what's going on here.
[01:10:40] They don't know how bad it is.
[01:10:41] But the reality was this war, this battle that lasted five months.
[01:10:45] There was all kinds of reporting in the glory of the Marines and what they were doing.
[01:10:51] And so they were, I guess, you know, they were just overwhelmed with the fact that this
[01:10:56] soldier said, you guys, are you kidding me?
[01:10:58] Guadalcanal, this is it.
[01:11:02] Now after they leave Guadalcanal, they get some much needed R&R.
[01:11:12] Rest in relaxation, they get to go to Australia, you did do this.
[01:11:16] And they, they go into the book.
[01:11:21] Of all the regiments ours, the first was in the most advantageous position for the great
[01:11:27] debauch.
[01:11:29] Discipline.
[01:11:30] Already dissolved in the delicious squeals of the girls all but disappeared that night.
[01:11:38] We received part of our six months of Rears of Spain in Australian pounds.
[01:11:43] But we were issued no clothing.
[01:11:45] We still wore our disheveled dungaries.
[01:11:48] So you can imagine these guys are coming off of Guadalcanal, hell.
[01:11:53] And now they're rolling into Australia.
[01:11:55] And they describe it here.
[01:11:56] Girls are waiting for them.
[01:11:58] These are the heroes of Guadalcanal.
[01:12:00] So they roll in and they get after it in the way that we talked about earlier.
[01:12:06] They start just, they're going crazy.
[01:12:12] And this is one of the things I loved about this book is that Robert Lecky is so real.
[01:12:21] He's so real.
[01:12:22] He's just a, he's just real.
[01:12:25] And guess what he likes to do?
[01:12:27] He likes to get after it.
[01:12:28] He goes out.
[01:12:29] He drinks.
[01:12:30] They drink.
[01:12:31] They chase women.
[01:12:32] He goes hard.
[01:12:34] And he ends up getting into some trouble.
[01:12:40] And he talks about brig rats.
[01:12:44] Basically, guys that have been thrown in the brig, which is, which is the military jail.
[01:12:48] And on a ship, they actually have a little brig, you know, a little jail room.
[01:12:52] And you can get thrown in there.
[01:12:54] And so we talked a little bit about that.
[01:12:59] It is most especially a marine sediment sentiment.
[01:13:03] And when analyzed, it turns out to be not shameless or shocking, but merely this.
[01:13:10] A man who lands in the brig is apt to be a man of bold spirit and independent mind who
[01:13:16] must occasionally rebel against the harsh and unrelenting discipline of the camp.
[01:13:22] I am not attempting to exalt what should be condemned.
[01:13:26] I'm not suggesting that because of their boldness or independence, the brig rats be
[01:13:31] forgiven and escape punishment.
[01:13:34] Brig'd they must be, and brig'd they were.
[01:13:38] Nor am I speaking of the habitual brig rat.
[01:13:43] The steady maligner, who, the good for nothing, who is more often in the brig than out of
[01:13:49] it, and who seeks to avoid every consequence of his uniform, even fighting.
[01:13:55] I speak of the young, high-hearted soldier whose very nature is bound to bring him into conflict
[01:14:01] with military discipline and to land him, unless he is exceptionally lucky in the brig.
[01:14:07] I speak of chocolate and chicken and oak stump and a dozen others.
[01:14:13] And of course of myself.
[01:14:16] So he's saying, look, you guys that are high-spirited go-getters, and they're going to get
[01:14:22] after it on the battlefield, and they're going to get after it on the liberty, and sometimes
[01:14:26] they're going to get rolled up unless they're super lucky, and that doesn't make
[01:14:29] them bad people.
[01:14:30] And I had one of my buddies getting really big trouble.
[01:14:34] This is when we were young guys.
[01:14:38] Back in the day, back in the day, one of my bros.
[01:14:41] He got in big trouble, and I thought that our officer, who's one of the best officers
[01:14:47] I ever worked for, I thought he was going to really, you know, just crush him and I thought
[01:14:52] he's going to be really disappointed in all these horrible things.
[01:14:55] And this is a guy.
[01:14:56] The officers of the guy that we all loved and wanted to always impress, and we wanted
[01:14:59] to do a good job for him.
[01:15:00] And so when my buddy had this big incident that he did, which, you know, he was drunk and
[01:15:05] got crazy and, you know, got arrested and all that, all that bad stuff.
[01:15:10] And I talked to our OIC about it in a today's, or you know, is, I mean, what's going to
[01:15:16] happen with my buddy.
[01:15:20] And the officer goes, hey, you guys are young warriors and things like this are going
[01:15:25] to happen.
[01:15:26] Don't let him happen much, but they're going to happen.
[01:15:29] And we'll deal with it.
[01:15:30] And I'll send myself.
[01:15:31] I don't know why I love this guy so much, but that's exactly it.
[01:15:35] You know, he was he knew that that, you know, you had young, ram-bunks, just guys full
[01:15:42] of testosterone and then you add alcohol into the equation and you add chaos into the
[01:15:48] equation, because some guys might control again.
[01:15:51] I hate to, to give that credence to this type of stuff.
[01:15:56] Because when I look back, I wish I would have been a better leader.
[01:15:58] I wish I would have been doing other things, you know, but if you're in a leadership position
[01:16:03] and you've got guys like this and you can demo instead of trying to help them, you're
[01:16:07] not helping them.
[01:16:08] It's goes back to this judgment thing that we talked about earlier.
[01:16:10] If I'm looking at you saying, oh, you don't, you don't, you got in trouble.
[01:16:16] You're a bad person.
[01:16:18] I don't want you on this team.
[01:16:19] Instead of saying, hey, look, we got to get you on a control.
[01:16:23] You got the right attitude.
[01:16:24] You got the lot of energy.
[01:16:25] Let's focus it on somewhere.
[01:16:26] Correct.
[01:16:27] Let's focus it on something good.
[01:16:29] Let's get you doing something positive instead of doing something negative.
[01:16:33] Instead, sometimes guys go into the judgmental mode.
[01:16:36] You know, I'm just going to judge you and oh, you got in trouble.
[01:16:39] So you're bad.
[01:16:40] That's the wrong attitude, Dave.
[01:16:42] How about you got in trouble?
[01:16:43] How about me is the leader.
[01:16:44] I let you down.
[01:16:46] I didn't show you the right way to expend your energy.
[01:16:48] I didn't give you the opportunity to give you an outlet for this, this aggression that
[01:16:54] you have.
[01:16:55] Because you, aggression you're going to have.
[01:16:57] That means fighting.
[01:16:59] You don't think you get up.
[01:17:00] You get a guy that are in the military.
[01:17:02] Do you want someone in your platoon?
[01:17:04] Do you want them to be not aggressive?
[01:17:06] Of course you want.
[01:17:07] I want the most aggressive bastard you can imagine.
[01:17:10] And guess what?
[01:17:11] If you don't give them to something to do with that aggression, they're going to find something
[01:17:14] to do with it.
[01:17:15] And it's not going to be good.
[01:17:16] So as a leader, let's find something positive that they can do with their aggression.
[01:17:20] Yeah, it's not like he's out there.
[01:17:22] Not like it's known.
[01:17:24] Like in your case, you thought he was going to get severely punished.
[01:17:29] Correct.
[01:17:30] It's not like he's out there publicly saying,
[01:17:32] hey, that's cool.
[01:17:33] Dude, what you got to do?
[01:17:34] Play.
[01:17:35] You're right.
[01:17:36] But when it happened, yeah, it's like.
[01:17:38] And I think truly that officer who is a great guy, he truly probably felt exactly what
[01:17:44] I just said, I should have given them a better outlet for this aggression.
[01:17:48] You know, I should have let I should have figured something better out for them to do.
[01:17:52] We got to do something.
[01:17:54] You give us idle hands and pockets full of money.
[01:17:57] Can you imagine these guys are getting six months pay and they were the richest guys
[01:18:01] in the world.
[01:18:02] I guarantee it.
[01:18:03] You know, especially rolling into wartime Australia.
[01:18:06] I mean, you know how stringent they were with with the restricting the money that people
[01:18:12] were using and spending all over the world to save money for the war.
[01:18:15] And here come these guys in.
[01:18:16] Richest guys ever.
[01:18:17] Heroes of Wall of Canal.
[01:18:19] I think they're going to get after it.
[01:18:22] They're going to get after it.
[01:18:24] So as leaders, what we need to do is give them a proper outlet.
[01:18:27] Right.
[01:18:28] Because those guys want to get after it.
[01:18:29] But you've got to give them the right way.
[01:18:30] Yeah.
[01:18:31] You know, you've got to give them something positive that they can work on.
[01:18:33] And if you're going to let them do something negative, then let's put some barriers around
[01:18:37] them so they don't get into trouble.
[01:18:42] Wish I would have known this when I was a when I was coming up.
[01:18:46] I would have done more positive stuff and said a more negative stuff.
[01:18:50] So now we get into the trouble piece.
[01:18:55] And these, he's got so many great stories about how these guys, what these guys were going
[01:18:58] through.
[01:19:00] And this, so they're out.
[01:19:02] He's out drinking.
[01:19:04] And one of his buddies, guy that I mentioned before, his name is Chuckler, Chuckler is actually
[01:19:09] on duty.
[01:19:10] So he's standing duty, which means he's uniform.
[01:19:12] He's not allowed to drink.
[01:19:13] He's watching and he's being, you know, he's on duty.
[01:19:19] And so here we go.
[01:19:20] I found Chuckler standing glumly outside the Slop Shoot entrance.
[01:19:25] He'd hope for the interior guard where he might sneak a beer or two.
[01:19:31] I'll get you one, I promised.
[01:19:33] I returned with a big glass out of which Chuckler might take a surpetitious sip.
[01:19:40] There were more side elves.
[01:19:42] Until Chuckler said, I got to go to the head.
[01:19:45] Here cover for me.
[01:19:47] He gave me his pistol belt and helmet and made off.
[01:19:50] So now, let these drunk right now.
[01:19:52] Okay, so.
[01:19:58] But Chuckler says, hey man, I'm going to take a piss here, take my helmet, take my pistol,
[01:20:03] cover for me.
[01:20:05] For a century to be drunk and then to desert as post and surrender as a weapon is to
[01:20:10] combine Cardinal Sin with unforgivable offense.
[01:20:15] I was anxiously hoping that he would hurry back.
[01:20:19] But then an unfortunate thing happened.
[01:20:22] Lieutenant Ivy League came striding down the corridor.
[01:20:26] I say it was unfortunate because Ivy League was the officer of the day.
[01:20:31] More than that, he was still the man who had philched my cigars, the enlisted men's cigars
[01:20:36] if he will.
[01:20:37] So at one point he had gotten hold of some cigars and this officer had taken him.
[01:20:44] And by the way, also Robert Lecky, he's an Irishman and I'm not going to make a generalization.
[01:20:54] Okay, yes, he's a hot tempered Irishman.
[01:20:59] And so he sees this guy and then he's drunk.
[01:21:03] He just got off the gullalacanel and here's what happens.
[01:21:06] Back to the book.
[01:21:07] My anger was nourished by the alcohol within me and I drew Chuckler's pistol and pointed
[01:21:12] at him and said, stop where you are.
[01:21:15] You lousy cigar stealing son of a bitch or I'll blow your gentleman's ass off.
[01:21:25] So not, not good.
[01:21:28] And he ends up getting in pretty significant trouble.
[01:21:37] And he actually gets bread and water.
[01:21:39] Which they still do that in the military.
[01:21:40] They get bread and water.
[01:21:42] You can get he gets bread and water for five days.
[01:21:44] So in the break, bread and water for five days.
[01:21:46] That's the punishment that he gets and he gets docked pay and he gets busted down and
[01:21:50] wreck.
[01:21:52] One time I was on a ship deployed, broken a jury and we were in a seal platoon.
[01:22:00] And I think I've told this story before.
[01:22:03] It was the one where the Marines like we would stay on the ship when we pulled an
[01:22:08] port and it would take like an hour to get off the ship because everyone would be waiting
[01:22:14] in line.
[01:22:15] And so what we would do is we would just work out for that hour hour and a half and
[01:22:19] it would go up.
[01:22:20] We could just walk right off the ship.
[01:22:21] Well, in that hour and a half the Marine, this young Marine had gone off the ship and was
[01:22:26] getting carried back onto the ship like passed out drunk covered in puke and an hour and a half.
[01:22:31] So that's what I think of when I figured these poor guys, can you come out and come
[01:22:33] off a bottle canal?
[01:22:34] You haven't even had water for six months.
[01:22:36] Never mind alcohol to the nightmare.
[01:22:41] But and of course they don't punish him too bad.
[01:22:45] Well, they they punish him, but they gotta keep him.
[01:22:48] You know, I mean, he's an able body Marine.
[01:22:50] They're not gonna, they're not gonna waste an able body Marine.
[01:22:53] And hopefully the Colonel in the back of his mind was thinking of himself, you know what?
[01:22:56] I want this guy and my, I want this guy with me.
[01:22:59] You know, this guy that's just gonna, you stole cigars from me?
[01:23:02] Cool.
[01:23:03] I'm gonna, I'm not threatening your life.
[01:23:04] Yeah, I'm just getting nuts.
[01:23:07] So they, but now Australia ends, they roll back out and it's time for them to start
[01:23:14] getting prepared to, they go to, they go to New Guinea.
[01:23:17] And if you remember New Guinea, that's another hard battle was fought there primarily by
[01:23:22] the Australians.
[01:23:23] It don't know just primarily, but the Australians definitely fought because I read that letter
[01:23:31] from the Australian soldier to his two year old daughter.
[01:23:33] That's where he died was a New Guinea, but now New Guinea is owned by the Allies and they
[01:23:41] go there to train to start to prepare for their next big push.
[01:23:45] And here we go back to the book.
[01:23:46] The truck climbed a series of small hills and finally deposited us in the middle of
[01:23:52] a field of Kuhnai grass, our new home.
[01:23:56] This is how the Marines train their men.
[01:23:59] Keep the mean and nasty like starving beasts says the core and they will fight better.
[01:24:06] When men are being moved from one place to another, spare no effort to make it painful.
[01:24:11] And before they've arrived at their destination, dispatch a man ahead to survey the
[01:24:16] ground with an eye toward diff discomfort.
[01:24:19] So you hear this all the time that that's the Marine Corps.
[01:24:22] The Marine Corps is gonna make you so pissed off.
[01:24:25] By the time you go into battle, you're just gonna kill everybody.
[01:24:28] Because you're so sick of living in the dirt.
[01:24:32] Now they do a decent amount of training and now they're preparing to assault another island
[01:24:41] called New Britain.
[01:24:42] This is I found this very interesting.
[01:24:44] So back to the book.
[01:24:46] The commander called us together that night delivered an eve of battle speech.
[01:24:52] He spoke in deliberate but angry tones.
[01:24:55] He spoke like a man who hated the Japanese as though he had suffered a personal affront
[01:25:01] at their hands and was bent on personal vengeance.
[01:25:06] As though this were a personal, not mechanical war.
[01:25:12] His harang seemed unreal.
[01:25:14] It was unreal because it could never produce the desired effect.
[01:25:19] Kill the Japs.
[01:25:20] The commander was saying, I want you to kill Japs and I want you to remember that you're
[01:25:25] the Marines.
[01:25:26] We've got a tough job where we're going and where we're going, you won't have much
[01:25:31] room for ammunition.
[01:25:32] So you'd better be sure you see something before you shoot.
[01:25:38] Don't squeeze the trigger until you've got meat in your sights.
[01:25:42] And when you do spill blood, spill yellow blood.
[01:25:49] That was all.
[01:25:51] We walked back to the tents.
[01:25:54] It was Christmas Eve.
[01:25:57] And I find this.
[01:25:58] It's Christmas Eve.
[01:25:59] He gets this speech and you can see like he's sitting here.
[01:26:02] There's thinking, okay, this guy's trying to get him all riled up and it's not having any
[01:26:06] impact.
[01:26:09] And this is what I found to be the real dichotomy here at the tents.
[01:26:15] Father's straight was preparing to say midnight mass.
[01:26:18] So they have a japan there, Catholic japan father's straight.
[01:26:23] And here's what he says, Father's straight spoke gently.
[01:26:29] He reminded us that not all of us would live to see another Christmas that perhaps some
[01:26:34] of us might die this very day.
[01:26:38] He told us to be sorry for our sins to ask the forgiveness of God, to forgive those who
[01:26:44] had wronged us, to prepare our souls for death.
[01:26:51] We sang hymns, nineteen hundred and forty odd years ago, the babe had been born and Bethlehem
[01:26:59] and we celebrated him this night in a dark and misty forest that his father had wrought.
[01:27:08] We sang hymns to him, silent night and hark the herald angel sing, mild the he lays his glory
[01:27:19] by born that man no more may die.
[01:27:27] And tomorrow our hands would be stained with the blood of our brothers.
[01:27:34] But we sang on half-heartedly, half hopingly, sometimes mechanically, sometimes with a desperate
[01:27:41] driving poignancy one hand on the heart, the other on the hilt of a bayonet in the morning,
[01:27:56] we marched down to the ships.
[01:28:03] So much more impactful on him was what father straight and much more than the fiery kernel
[01:28:10] that said we're going to go kill japs here.
[01:28:13] These guys are, I mean can you imagine you go in for comfort to midnight mass, Christmas
[01:28:21] Eve and you get told that many people, many of you may die this very day and to prepare
[01:28:31] your soul for death.
[01:28:33] That's what these guys are facing.
[01:28:35] That's what they're most trusted, the most trusted person in their lives, right?
[01:28:40] Their spiritual counselor is telling them prepare for death.
[01:28:43] Yeah, kind of like we'll talk about sometimes where you get a guy, like if you're watching
[01:28:51] a video and it's a guy getting you fired up, he's getting fired up to get you fired
[01:28:55] up, sometimes they can work but a lot of times that won't really work because you kind
[01:28:59] of feel like he's trying to sell you something.
[01:29:02] But then if you hear someone maybe even talking to someone else or talking about something
[01:29:06] else and you just kind of extrapolate certain things that get you fired up because it's
[01:29:12] so authentic.
[01:29:13] It's basically the indirect approach on your own mind.
[01:29:16] Yeah, and right, from mind.
[01:29:18] Yes.
[01:29:18] Back to the book on the sunless shores of New Britain where the rainforest crowded steeply
[01:29:27] down to the sea, we of the first Marine Division came back to the assault and it was here
[01:29:33] that we cut the Japanese to pieces literally when that devouring jungle did not dissolve
[01:29:39] them.
[01:29:40] And it was here that we pitted them.
[01:29:45] Now to pity the enemy is either madness or is it a sign or it is a sign of strength.
[01:29:53] I think that with the first Marine Division on New Britain, it was a sign of strength.
[01:30:00] He pitted him in the end this fleeing foe disorganized, demoralized crawling on hands
[01:30:08] and knees even in that dissolving downpour.
[01:30:14] For in the end it was we.
[01:30:20] The soft of feet Americans who had learned to get along in the jungle and who bore up
[01:30:28] the best beneath the ordeal of the monsoon and in these things lay our strength.
[01:30:40] And I'll tell you what I think that boils down to.
[01:30:43] So what they're saying here is these, you know, the Americans, what do people around
[01:30:46] the world think of the Americans?
[01:30:48] Even in 1943, Americans are soft.
[01:30:51] Americans are lazy Americans.
[01:30:53] They have too much comfort.
[01:30:55] And you think the exact opposite of the Japanese, especially in World War II, the Imperial
[01:30:58] Japanese Army, it was highly disciplined, it was extremely strict, it was a Spartan lifestyle.
[01:31:05] But look at what happened here and why is that?
[01:31:09] And I'll tell you why.
[01:31:11] In my opinion, I will tell you why.
[01:31:13] Because you have men that are fighting for freedom.
[01:31:18] They're fighting for freedom.
[01:31:20] And that makes all the difference in the world fighting for individual freedom, fighting for
[01:31:25] their personal freedom and fighting for their nations freedom and fighting for their nations
[01:31:30] freedom and its nation that is based upon freedom.
[01:31:34] That right there is stronger than any tyrannical government or any fanatical idea.
[01:31:49] The idea of freedom is stronger than the most.
[01:31:52] And that is why these quote, soft Americans, that is why they were able to conquer and
[01:32:02] defeat this enemy.
[01:32:03] This hardened enemy, this well-trained enemy.
[01:32:12] And this talks a little bit about what we were facing.
[01:32:19] To the north one patrol discovered the body of an e-companies scout who had been reported
[01:32:23] missing.
[01:32:25] The area bore the marks of a struggle as though we had fought hand to hand.
[01:32:30] His body bore dozens of bayonet wounds, they had used him for bayonet practice.
[01:32:38] In his mouth, they had stuffed flesh, they had cut from his arm.
[01:32:43] His buddy said he had a tattoo there.
[01:32:46] The marine emblem, the fouled anchor, and the globe.
[01:32:52] The japs cut it off and stuffed it in his mouth.
[01:32:57] The commander was angry.
[01:33:01] Again to the north, two Japanese officers had been caught snooping around our positions
[01:33:06] and had been killed.
[01:33:09] An e-companie outpost scouting the terrain at their front and discovered a Japanese force
[01:33:13] in platoon strength, sleeping, sleeping on the ground, sleeping.
[01:33:19] They fired into them into these sleeping supermen of the jungle with drawing upon the approach
[01:33:27] of another enemy platoon.
[01:33:35] And after this, after the bulk of the battle takes place and it was fair.
[01:33:42] It was not a fair fight and you're about to find out why.
[01:33:47] Back to the book, four Japanese soldiers and one officer had been taken alive and had been
[01:33:52] brought down to the CP, their arms bound behind them knives at their throats and from them
[01:33:57] we learned that the third company, 53rd Regiment of the Japanese 17th Division, had been
[01:34:03] dispatched from the main body at Cape Clouster to defend against our landing.
[01:34:10] The passage had been through near imprenetrable jungle and they had not arrived on the scene
[01:34:15] until two days after our own coming.
[01:34:20] Nevertheless, they attacked us.
[01:34:23] They attacked us, some 100 of them against our force of some 1200 and but for the prisoners
[01:34:30] we had annihilated them.
[01:34:33] Were they brave or fanatical?
[01:34:35] What had they hoped to gain?
[01:34:37] Did their commander really believe that a company of Japanese soldiers could conquer a battalion
[01:34:41] of American Marines experienced confident, better armed and placed on higher ground?
[01:34:47] Why did not turn around and march his men home again?
[01:34:51] Was it because no Japanese soldier can report failure?
[01:34:54] Cannot lose face?
[01:34:58] I cannot answer.
[01:35:01] Our dead were six men among them the stubby and trepured OB, whom I'd last seen in Melbourne
[01:35:07] and so drunk he could barely stand, whose gun pit had been overrun when the japs overwhelmed
[01:35:12] the section of the lines and their first silent rush up the hillside.
[01:35:17] OB, who had helped to drive them out in the counter attack and who had been alternatingly
[01:35:23] firing and hurling implications at them until one of their bullets took him squarely in the
[01:35:29] forehead.
[01:35:32] May he rest in peace.
[01:35:35] The Japanese dead lay in heaps on the hillside and they filled the trench where OB's
[01:35:40] gun had been located.
[01:35:48] So that shows the will of the Japanese fighters no doubt about it.
[01:35:54] They were hard core and they got told to attack with a hundred eyes against nine hundred
[01:36:00] or twelve hundred and they said, alright, let's do this.
[01:36:05] Now, the life, the existence in this jungle was harsh back to the book.
[01:36:15] The puffing of my lips and eyes symbolized the mystery and poison of this terrible island.
[01:36:20] Mysterious, perhaps I mean to say new Britain was evil, darkly and secretly evil, a
[01:36:26] malifactor and enemy of humankind.
[01:36:30] An adversary really dissolving, corroding, poisoning, chilling, sucking, drenching, coming
[01:36:36] at a man with its rolling, mist, green mold and ceaseless downpour, tripping him with his
[01:36:42] numberless roots and vines, poisoning him with green insects and bugs and treacherous
[01:36:48] tree bark, turning the sun from his bones and cheer from his heart dissolving him.
[01:36:54] The rain, the mold, the damp steadily pucking each, plucking each cell apart like tiny hands
[01:37:01] tearing at the petals of a flower, dissolving him.
[01:37:05] I say into a mindless, formless fluid like the sop of mud into which his feet forever fall
[01:37:12] in a monotonous, slopsuck, slopsuck, that is the sound of nothingness, the song of the jungle
[01:37:19] wherein everything falls apart in hollow harmony with the rain.
[01:37:26] Nothing could stand against it.
[01:37:28] A letter home had to be read and re-read and memorized for a fell apart in your pocket
[01:37:32] in less than a week.
[01:37:33] A pair of socks lasted no longer.
[01:37:35] A pack of cigarettes became sodden and worthless unless smoked that day.
[01:37:41] Pocket knife blades rusted together, watches recorded the period of their own decay.
[01:37:45] Rain made garbage of the food, pencil swelled and burst apart, fountain pens clogged and
[01:37:51] their points separated.
[01:37:52] Rifle barrels turned blue with mold and had to be slung upside down to keep out the
[01:37:56] rain.
[01:37:57] Bullets stuck together in rifle magazines and machine gunners had to go over their belts
[01:38:01] daily, extracting and oiling and reinserting the bullets to prevent them from sticking
[01:38:06] to the cloth loops.
[01:38:08] And everything lay, damp and sodden and squashed to the touch, exuding that steady musty
[01:38:13] weak that is the jungle's own, that individual odor of decay rising from vegetable life
[01:38:19] so luxurious and growing so swiftly that it seems to hasten the decomposition from the
[01:38:25] moment of birth.
[01:38:28] It was into this green hell that we were inserted a day or two after the march.
[01:38:33] And here was fought that battle with the rain forest.
[01:38:37] Here the jungle and the men were locked in conflict far more basic than our shooting
[01:38:43] war the Japanese for here.
[01:38:45] The struggle was for existence itself.
[01:38:51] The war was forgotten who could comprehend it.
[01:38:56] Who cared.
[01:39:02] And what do you say?
[01:39:07] And I have not spent that much time in the jungle.
[01:39:09] I spent some, I think the longs I've been in the jungle is maybe a month and it wasn't
[01:39:15] as bad as this.
[01:39:16] It wasn't raining as that much.
[01:39:19] But I can't even imagine just that constant.
[01:39:24] There's no escape from it.
[01:39:26] There's no escape from it.
[01:39:27] And it's even worse for leki and I'll tell you why.
[01:39:31] Back to the book.
[01:39:33] I would be wet not only from the rain.
[01:39:37] There's sometimes it stopped and at other times it did not fall so fast that a jungle
[01:39:41] hammock could not repel it.
[01:39:43] But because an affliction which I had begun, which had begun the moment I left Australia,
[01:39:49] was now again active.
[01:39:52] It had begun during the discomforts of grotto can now had disappeared in the civilized
[01:39:57] living of Melbourne and had reappeared.
[01:40:02] On good enough island, New Guinea and now on New Britain.
[01:40:09] I learned later from doctors to call it an e-reases.
[01:40:15] Winnersleep, the bladder empties.
[01:40:18] And that is that.
[01:40:22] So he puts that really nicely.
[01:40:26] But here's what's going on.
[01:40:28] This is the stress that he's under when he goes to bed.
[01:40:33] He pisses in his pants.
[01:40:36] And it's just he can't stop it.
[01:40:41] There's nothing he can do about it.
[01:40:44] And it won't go away.
[01:40:48] In fact, it went away.
[01:40:50] It will go away when the stress stops.
[01:40:52] When he went to Melbourne, it's all good.
[01:40:54] It stops.
[01:40:55] It's going to go away when he gets back out there in the stress of combat, the stress of the environment.
[01:40:59] And when he goes to bed, he pisses himself.
[01:41:04] And certainly he made a decision to put that in this book for a reason.
[01:41:15] And there is, it does fall into the story a little bit.
[01:41:18] But the reason I love that he put it in there is because it's just another thing.
[01:41:24] He's dealing with.
[01:41:26] And he's not even ashamed of it.
[01:41:27] He said, yeah, I'm stressed out.
[01:41:32] Scared.
[01:41:34] And I'm pissing myself.
[01:41:35] But guess what?
[01:41:36] I'm still going on patrol.
[01:41:41] Back to the book.
[01:41:42] The last patrol was a prolonged one of several days.
[01:41:45] We were taken by landing boat down the east coast to a place called Old Notamo.
[01:41:52] And there deposited.
[01:41:54] The place had once been inhabited by the Japs, but all their emplacements were now empty.
[01:42:02] Those of the enemy who were discovered were in the last extremities of Ordeal.
[01:42:08] Some were overtaken, crawling on their hands and knees.
[01:42:12] Some so badly decomposed it was as though their feet were rotting off.
[01:42:18] Some weighing perhaps no more than 80 pounds.
[01:42:21] Some were not weapons, all without food and all possessed of that indelentible fighting spirit.
[01:42:28] That was the Japanese Imperial Army's greatest asset.
[01:42:33] The one single factor that made a poorly equipped soldier a first-rate foe.
[01:42:40] They all resisted.
[01:42:43] And they were all destroyed, bayoneted for the most part.
[01:42:47] It was file for it was folly to fire on patrol in unfriendly unknown territory.
[01:42:55] One of these stragglers was strangled and cold blood by the kid, a youngster who, although
[01:43:00] already a veteran of gullal can now, was hardly acquainted with a razor.
[01:43:07] He would go mad two months later.
[01:43:11] So they come up across these Japanese, total 80 pounds malnourished.
[01:43:19] Some of them didn't even have weapons and they're just trying to fight anyways.
[01:43:27] He ends up with a hernia.
[01:43:30] It's a leaky, ends up with a hernia.
[01:43:34] And he gets pulled off to go take a look at his hernia.
[01:43:40] And they say, yeah, you got a bad hernia.
[01:43:42] But it's not bad enough.
[01:43:43] You're going back to the front.
[01:43:47] Then the army comes and replaces them there.
[01:43:50] And next thing, next move is they go to train at a place called Pavuvo.
[01:43:57] Pavu Islander doing another training to get ready for another island campaign.
[01:44:04] And here we go back to the book.
[01:44:05] The food was bad too.
[01:44:07] And the tents were rotten and punctured with holes.
[01:44:09] There was no water, except for what was caught in her helmets during the night.
[01:44:13] We bathed by dashing naked into the rain, soaping ourselves, madly in a race against the
[01:44:17] probability of the rain ceasing and being left streaked with sticky stope soap.
[01:44:23] And we washed our clothes by boiling them in cans of rain water.
[01:44:28] Our jungle rot had become so bad, so persistent that there was an appointed time each
[01:44:33] afternoon for the men to take off their shoes and socks and to lie out on their sacks with
[01:44:38] corrosive feet thrust out into the sun.
[01:44:42] But we had borne all this before.
[01:44:45] And we could bear it again.
[01:44:47] Nor could mere bad food or leaky tents press upon the ardor of my comrades.
[01:44:54] It was the death of hope that bore us down.
[01:44:58] There had always been hope, hope of relief, hope of the sun, hope of victory, hope of survival.
[01:45:05] But when they came and told us that none of us were going home on rotation, we strangled
[01:45:11] hope and turned into wooden soldiers.
[01:45:15] The future looked to innumerable enemy held islands and innumerable assaults and we had already
[01:45:23] noticed how the ranks of the new river originals were dwindling with every action.
[01:45:28] There were even a few suicides to suggest how to spare some could find the situation.
[01:45:35] Then the thing changed.
[01:45:41] They came and said half of the originals could go home.
[01:45:45] So these guys get to word.
[01:45:47] Hey look, we're praying for another salt, but half of you originals are going to go home.
[01:45:53] There was joy and then once the method of selection for the state side bound became known,
[01:46:01] there was anger.
[01:46:03] There would be a drawing, a state side lottery, in which men's names were repold from a hat.
[01:46:10] But only the names of those who had never been in trouble.
[01:46:15] I was among those whose name did not go into the hat, and so was runner and housher and
[01:46:20] chicken and souvenirs and a host of others.
[01:46:24] It seemed that the originals of the second battalion first marines had been neatly divided
[01:46:29] into good guys and bad guys.
[01:46:33] Among us they raged a profane anger.
[01:46:37] I know now how a convict must feel upon being turned down a job after being turned
[01:46:43] down a job after job because of its past.
[01:46:47] That was what disqualified us our past.
[01:46:50] It made no difference that we had been punished.
[01:46:53] Yes, punished again and again for to become customary to solve all problems of selection
[01:46:58] this way by marking brig rats for dirty duty and excluding them from special benefits.
[01:47:07] Nor did it matter that we had good war records.
[01:47:16] In retrospect, it's easy to forgive my commanders this, but then it was hard.
[01:47:22] It was too much like being unfairly condemned to death.
[01:47:28] The injustice of it overwhelmed me and I burned with a resentment that was dangerous to carry
[01:47:33] around.
[01:47:37] So what a one.
[01:47:39] What a nightmare.
[01:47:41] They say look we're going to have a little lottery.
[01:47:43] Some of you guys are going to get a home everyone's happy and say by the way if you've
[01:47:46] been in any trouble you don't get on the list.
[01:47:49] That's a death sentence.
[01:47:51] The way he's seen it.
[01:47:52] There's a death sentence.
[01:47:53] I'm going to keep doing this island hopping campaign.
[01:47:56] We're going to keep going.
[01:47:57] There's all these innumerable islands that need to be taken down.
[01:48:01] You're going to be on all of them and you've already seen X number of guys that you had
[01:48:05] killed and you're going to keep going until you're killed.
[01:48:08] So this was like a death sentence.
[01:48:10] Meanwhile the guys who might be able to go there just they're right there.
[01:48:14] And you're right next to you.
[01:48:18] And those guys probably did a lot of the same crap.
[01:48:22] Yeah, yeah, so the back to the book, my and your recess was more noticeable than before.
[01:48:32] Perhaps to the agitation of the moment aggravated it.
[01:48:36] I know that the men in my tent had been urging me to report it to sick bay.
[01:48:41] I did the doctor who knew of my case ordered me to banika.
[01:48:47] I was leaving in the morning.
[01:48:47] So with that, he basically says, okay, you know what, I'm pissing on myself.
[01:48:54] The guys have been telling me to go see the doctor about it.
[01:48:57] I haven't done that.
[01:48:58] I have a hernia.
[01:49:00] I'm going to go to medical.
[01:49:01] So he goes to medical and the doctor says, okay, you're going to go to banika.
[01:49:04] And banika is a is a island where they just are set up to handle wounded.
[01:49:12] And when he gets to banika, it's it's kind of shocking back to the book.
[01:49:19] Banika was a flesh pot.
[01:49:21] Banika was the big town.
[01:49:22] Banika was Broadway.
[01:49:25] Banika had women.
[01:49:26] It had buildings of steel and wood.
[01:49:28] It had roads.
[01:49:29] It had thousands of sailors as sleek as campans.
[01:49:35] It had movie amphitheaters.
[01:49:37] It had electric lights.
[01:49:42] It had canteens overflowing with candy and comforts.
[01:49:47] Banika had beer.
[01:49:49] Walking with the others from the beach to the navy hospital, I felt like a hick on his first
[01:49:52] visit to New York.
[01:49:54] Jeeps and trucks and staff cars swept over the islands, roads, raising a busy cloud of dust,
[01:50:00] cranes, croaked and cranked on the beach, loading and unloading the boats.
[01:50:04] And peas patrol the stockade of pointed sticks behind which, to well, the women.
[01:50:10] The navy nurses and red crossworkers.
[01:50:14] Everyone was well fed and unwured.
[01:50:17] The seat of every pair of pants was filled and happy.
[01:50:23] We, the lean ones, who wore our discontent on our faces and carried our nervous impatience
[01:50:30] in our hands, must have been a disturbing presence in that pouring island incubator.
[01:50:36] Yet as I walked along, I was filled with the uneasy suspicion that it would be the image
[01:50:44] of Banika and not pervue that would be presented to America as the Pacific War.
[01:50:53] They do that pretty good job of this in the series.
[01:50:57] That is good as they could have done because they show the guys coming on to a beach and
[01:51:03] there's nurses and they're dressed in like a beautiful clean white and they're literally
[01:51:06] handing out lemonade and it's such a contradiction to what they've been living.
[01:51:11] So you get that, but this image is even crazier in my mind of coming on this island.
[01:51:16] You become an off-pavu voo voo, you're living in the hell.
[01:51:20] And here these guys are whatever a quick flight away and they've got movie theaters and
[01:51:24] they've got beer and they've got women running around.
[01:51:27] It's just totally, totally different.
[01:51:29] And I've talked about that a bunch of times in here.
[01:51:31] You could be, you could be in World War II.
[01:51:35] But if you were on the island of Banika, wasn't that much of a sacrifice as it was compared
[01:51:39] to somebody that was on the island-happened campaign?
[01:51:41] It's not.
[01:51:42] And it's the same thing.
[01:51:43] There's places I wasn't Iraq where I would say, God, this is crazy.
[01:51:47] How nice this is.
[01:51:48] They got a swimming pool.
[01:51:50] The baits some of the baits said swimming pools.
[01:51:53] They got a nice gym.
[01:51:54] They got a nice childhood.
[01:51:55] Then you go out to some outstation in the middle of some forward operating base.
[01:52:01] And these dudes would be living hard, totally different for different people.
[01:52:09] Now leki gets put basically into a psych ward.
[01:52:15] They want to look at him.
[01:52:16] And he starts having this conversation with a psychologist.
[01:52:23] And I think this is a very important conversation.
[01:52:27] Back to the book.
[01:52:28] He began to question me about my experiences in war.
[01:52:31] And as I told them to him, he shook his head from side to side as though to indicate that
[01:52:35] my whole division not only myself ought to be psychoanalyzed.
[01:52:41] Then we talked of books for he was well read and philosophy.
[01:52:45] Suddenly he broke it off and said, what did you say you were?
[01:52:50] Meaning what did you say you did in the Marine Corps?
[01:52:52] A scout I said, Bradley, I used to be a machine gunner.
[01:52:58] And the doctor says back, but that's no place for a man of your caliber.
[01:53:04] Now I was shocked.
[01:53:07] The old Shibaleth intelligence had not our government been culpable enough in pampering
[01:53:15] the high IQ drafties as though they were too intelligent to fight for their country.
[01:53:22] Could not doctor gentle see that I was proud to be a scout and before that a machine gunner
[01:53:31] intelligence intelligence intelligence.
[01:53:35] Keep it up America.
[01:53:37] Keep telling your youth that mud and danger are fit only for intellectual pigs.
[01:53:44] Keep on saying that only the stupid are fit to sacrifice that America must be defended
[01:53:50] by the low brow.
[01:53:52] Keep in mind that the high brow keep fawning head over heart and soon the head will arrive
[01:54:01] at the complete folly of any kind of fight and meetly surrender the treasure to the first
[01:54:08] bandit with enough heart to demand it.
[01:54:15] Be careful.
[01:54:19] I think that we do a really good job now in America.
[01:54:25] You get kids that are, you know, there will be enlisted kids with bachelor's degrees
[01:54:31] and master's degrees in the army and the Marine Corps and the Seal teams.
[01:54:37] I don't think we have that as much, but it's definitely something that you need to
[01:54:41] watch out for.
[01:54:42] I think especially this goes back to judgment.
[01:54:46] I posted that earlier today.
[01:54:48] I met some young Marine, not a young Marine, but you know, guys probably 25, 27 years old
[01:54:54] and he came into the gym and you know, some say, I use in the Marine Corps.
[01:54:58] That's awesome man.
[01:54:59] What's doing the Marine Corps?
[01:55:00] He was like, I was a machine gunner.
[01:55:03] Like yes, like yes, that's awesome.
[01:55:07] But to have somebody think, oh, you were just a machine gunner, you must know.
[01:55:12] Be the machine gunner should be a faunted and elevated position in the world.
[01:55:25] Bless the machine gunner is not there.
[01:55:30] You want to talk about a person that can get stuff done.
[01:55:32] Go talk to a machine gunner.
[01:55:34] They'll make some stuff happen.
[01:55:36] They're carrying a big peg of gun around.
[01:55:39] They're laying down fire under pressure, put him off.
[01:55:44] I'll put the machine gunner up against one of these intellectuals.
[01:55:46] Eddie, day the week, bring it.
[01:55:49] But the machine gunner can be an intellectual.
[01:55:51] Absolutely.
[01:55:52] Absolutely.
[01:55:53] That's the point.
[01:55:54] Yeah.
[01:55:55] That's the point.
[01:55:56] Just because someone chooses to do something that's hard doesn't mean that they're
[01:56:00] not smart.
[01:56:01] Right.
[01:56:02] In fact, I go so as far as to say they are searching for.
[01:56:09] And discovering and becoming something that takes a level of mind power to do.
[01:56:19] Yeah.
[01:56:20] Kind of like that the week superficial assumption is that, oh, you're going to choose that
[01:56:27] kind of that hard thing.
[01:56:28] Because it's not really intuitive to just, I'm going to go for the hardest thing.
[01:56:32] It's intuitive to be like, I want to get this easy thing to do because it's easier.
[01:56:37] So when someone chooses the hard thing to do, the kind of assumption is that, oh, you
[01:56:42] had no other choice.
[01:56:43] Oh, yeah.
[01:56:44] Yes.
[01:56:45] Perfect.
[01:56:46] But, yes.
[01:56:47] No, man.
[01:56:48] I think that's a guy in high school where he's a year old in us.
[01:56:50] And he was like a smart guy and had all his stuff to get a good family and he went
[01:56:55] into the army.
[01:56:56] And I remember some people were like kind of surprised because they're going to just
[01:57:00] to the army that just like Dr. Gentle here.
[01:57:03] Oh, what are you doing that for?
[01:57:05] Because I want to be a machine gunner.
[01:57:06] Yeah, that's why.
[01:57:07] Yeah.
[01:57:08] Props to the machine gunners.
[01:57:13] Now out on the silent, he's there.
[01:57:16] He spends like a month and they're sitting down to watch a movie at the theater.
[01:57:24] I'll play that.
[01:57:25] Remember one time we had the awesome C-B's that worked for Winner Maudi with us.
[01:57:30] And so they're building bunkers.
[01:57:33] I'm not kidding.
[01:57:34] What were their priority builds when they were in the body with me on our little camp,
[01:57:37] camp, Mark Lee?
[01:57:39] The priorities that they were working on were bunkers were security walls on the river,
[01:57:47] getting barbed wire.
[01:57:48] Those are the priorities they were working on.
[01:57:50] And my lead CB, my CB chief.
[01:57:53] He had to go to our headquarters for a couple days to get money and get equipment and
[01:57:59] whatever.
[01:58:00] And when he came back, he was great dude.
[01:58:04] His nickname was Biggie.
[01:58:07] And he was big.
[01:58:09] Another one of those things.
[01:58:11] Yeah, yeah.
[01:58:12] No, he would, he would, like his warm-up sets on bench, we're in three 15.
[01:58:18] He was big.
[01:58:19] Big strong.
[01:58:20] Yeah.
[01:58:21] He was strong.
[01:58:22] And he came back and, you know, he says, he says, hey sir, come back from Fouloujia.
[01:58:27] And I was like, oh, everything cool out there.
[01:58:29] He goes, let me tell you something.
[01:58:30] I was like, what's that, Biggie?
[01:58:32] He says, you know what they're building out there?
[01:58:34] I said, no, I have no idea.
[01:58:36] I don't care what they're building out there.
[01:58:37] Because they're building the theater.
[01:58:40] I said, what?
[01:58:41] He said, they're building the theater.
[01:58:43] I said, you mean a movie theater?
[01:58:45] He goes, yes, off the theater.
[01:58:48] And he was just beside himself.
[01:58:51] Because here we were trying to build bunkers and security walls, they were building
[01:58:56] the theater.
[01:58:57] We didn't make it in like that.
[01:58:59] But those CVs man, they kept us, they kept everything wrong and wrong.
[01:59:03] And props, once you were props to the machine gunners, props to the CVs.
[01:59:08] Oh, for sure.
[01:59:09] So they're an a theater that had been built out here.
[01:59:14] And the movie began, there was an interruption over a public-adjust system of voice announced
[01:59:19] allied troops have just invaded northern France.
[01:59:23] The second front has been opened.
[01:59:26] The fears and shouts rose into the soft night to be followed by a buzz of excitement.
[01:59:31] But then the film began, and silence was restored.
[01:59:36] I arose and left the amphitheater.
[01:59:39] My heart throbbing and excitement.
[01:59:41] It was difficult to comprehend this excitement.
[01:59:44] It was a mix of thrill and pride.
[01:59:47] But predominating was the heartbeat of anxiety.
[01:59:50] For suddenly, it had been born in upon me that great events were happening.
[01:59:56] That the war was now rushing downhill to victory.
[02:00:00] And here I was, clad and pallid pajamas and robe lounging around the hospital.
[02:00:07] Yarning came upon me in a rush, and I wept herring along the dark road back to the hospital.
[02:00:13] I wanted to rejoin my comrades.
[02:00:17] Where he goes into the doctor, gentle, goes into his office.
[02:00:21] And basically they work it out.
[02:00:25] Back to the book.
[02:00:26] There's not much we can do for this trouble of yours.
[02:00:28] The hospital commander told me there's no carrying it out here.
[02:00:31] What you need is a change of climate and a less nerve-racking assignment.
[02:00:36] You're shipping me back to the state, sir.
[02:00:38] I asked he smiled wainly, ordinarily yes.
[02:00:42] Unfortunately, you Marines can't go home unless you're carried home.
[02:00:46] So we are sending you back to duty with the suggestion that you're commanding officer,
[02:00:51] have the century wake you during the night.
[02:00:54] I laughed and he laughed and Dr. Gentle laughed.
[02:01:01] Because they knew that's not something that's feasible.
[02:01:03] What they're basically saying is you're going to go back and you're just going to piss yourself
[02:01:06] and you're going to fight.
[02:01:07] And that's exactly what he wanted.
[02:01:10] Let's back there and now back to the book we left Pavu Vu.
[02:01:18] Victor's of Guadalcanal, new Britain, we went out to fight again marching into the open
[02:01:23] John landing craft, driven up on the beach.
[02:01:27] Never before where we so confident of victory never again would its price be so high.
[02:01:36] Galileo was already a Holocaust.
[02:01:41] The island flat and almost featureless was an altar being prepared for the emulation of
[02:01:49] 17,000 men.
[02:01:51] So they're going on to Pella Lu.
[02:01:58] And here we go right into it.
[02:02:00] They're in their landing craft.
[02:02:01] The water began to erupt in little geysers and the air became populated with exploding
[02:02:05] steel.
[02:02:06] And me was saluting us.
[02:02:07] They were receiving us with mortar and artillery fire.
[02:02:10] 10,000 Japanese awaited on the island of Pella Lu.
[02:02:13] 10,000 men is brave and determined and skillful.
[02:02:17] As ever a garrison was since the art of warfare began.
[02:02:21] Skillful.
[02:02:22] Yes, it was a terrible rain and it did terrible work among us before we reached the beach.
[02:02:30] Our amtrak was among the first assault waves.
[02:02:33] The beach was already a litter of burning blackened and phyby and trackers of dead and wounded.
[02:02:40] A morda garden of exploding mortar shells.
[02:02:44] Holes had beer scooped in the white sand or had been blasted out by the shells.
[02:02:51] The beach was poked with holes all filled with green clad, helmeted marines.
[02:02:57] We were pinned down.
[02:02:59] We were pinned down but not by mortars alone.
[02:03:01] The machine gun fire came from an invincible outpost which the Japanese had blasted out
[02:03:06] of a coral jutting into the bay.
[02:03:09] We found an opening in it and even then we were filling it with all manners of small
[02:03:14] armed fire grenades.
[02:03:15] Sticks of dynamite hurled by men who had crept up to it or billowing fire from the flame
[02:03:20] floors who had also gained the hole but the answering fire continued to break are deadly
[02:03:31] picnic ground.
[02:03:34] And the reason for that is here for the Japanese had possessed a pebble for two decades
[02:03:40] and had blasted into the coral a network of mutually supporting caves so that so these
[02:03:47] they'd been there for twenty years preparing for this and so they've got this massive cave
[02:03:53] network and even to every time they hit one of these locations.
[02:03:57] The more guys were just pop up and they also the Japanese also had tanks on Pelaloo
[02:04:03] back to the book.
[02:04:04] Their tanks swooped in suddenly upon us.
[02:04:07] They came tearing across the airfield a dozen or so of them.
[02:04:10] It was startling.
[02:04:11] They'd come out of nowhere and here were only riflemen and machine gunners to oppose
[02:04:16] them.
[02:04:17] It was a violent outburst of gunfire.
[02:04:19] I poked my head above the crater through the lacy branch work of the scrub trees.
[02:04:24] I saw an enemy tank streaking along with snipers and camouflage hanging onto the rear.
[02:04:30] It was but a moment's glance but at the time my eye caught sight of a marine from F company
[02:04:36] a veteran running bowl leg into the rear his face writhing shouting tanks tanks and officer
[02:04:42] grabbed him and spun him around and kicked him and propelled him back to his post.
[02:04:48] In the crater we'd prepared for defense like a caravan attacked by Indians.
[02:04:54] The enemy tanks whist past their little wheels whirling within the tracks.
[02:04:59] Machine guns clattered bazookas whambed our airplanes came screeching down from heaven and
[02:05:05] they rose the detonation of their bombs and the roar of exploding tanks.
[02:05:11] To my right I saw a line of our tanks advancing firing as they came seem to stop each
[02:05:16] time their guns stuttered.
[02:05:19] Then it was over the jab tanks had been destroyed.
[02:05:26] I turned to go and as I did nearly stepped on someone's hand.
[02:05:33] Excuse me I began to say but then I saw that it was an unattached hand or rather a detached
[02:05:40] one it lay there alone open palm upwards clean capable solitary.
[02:05:48] I could not tear my eyes from it the hand is the artisan of the soul.
[02:05:53] It is the second member of the human trinity of head and hand and heart.
[02:06:00] Man has no faculty more human than his hand.
[02:06:04] More beautiful, more expressive, nor productive to see this hand lying alone as though contempt
[02:06:13] usually cast aside no longer a part of man no longer his help was to see war in all its
[02:06:21] wantiness.
[02:06:23] It was to see the especially brutal savagery of our own technique of rending.
[02:06:31] And it was to see men at their eternal worst turning upon one another tearing one another
[02:06:38] clawing at their own innards with the maniacal fury of the pride possessed.
[02:06:47] Not much I can comment on that one.
[02:06:52] Back to the book our casualties were extremely heavy.
[02:06:56] More the day was done they were total 500 in the first regiment something like 20% this on the
[02:07:02] first day.
[02:07:05] We were advancing again our objective with bloody nose ridge.
[02:07:09] This was the high ground visible from across the airfield it gave the enemy perfect observation.
[02:07:17] Advancing across the flat table of crushed coral on which there was hardly a single
[02:07:22] depression as we were easily cited as clay ducks in a shooting gallery.
[02:07:29] But there was no other route and we had to take it.
[02:07:33] Grass cutting machine gun fire swept the airfield mortars mortarshells fell with the
[02:07:38] com regularity of automation.
[02:07:42] Marines fell.
[02:07:44] They crumpled.
[02:07:45] They staggered.
[02:07:47] They pitched forward.
[02:07:48] They sank to their knees.
[02:07:53] They fell backwards.
[02:07:55] They kept advancing.
[02:08:04] The mortars had stopped.
[02:08:08] The first F company wave was advancing across the air strip running low with ranks scattered,
[02:08:13] resting a withering machine gun fire that had been going to break the runway.
[02:08:19] They were falling.
[02:08:20] It seemed unreal.
[02:08:22] It seemed a tabloat like a scene from a motion picture.
[02:08:28] It required an effort of mine to recall that these were flesh and blood Marines men who
[02:08:34] my new, whose lives were linked with mine.
[02:08:39] The bill mort was required in facing up to the fact that my turn was next.
[02:08:47] Here is the point in battle where one needs the rallying cry.
[02:08:52] Here where the banner must be unfurled or the song song where the name of the cause
[02:08:56] flung at the enemy like a challenge.
[02:08:58] Here is the mounted charge.
[02:09:01] The thing is old as warfare itself that either overwhelms the defense and wins the battle
[02:09:07] or is broken and brings on defeat.
[02:09:11] How much less for bidding might have been that avenue of death that I was about to cross
[02:09:16] had there been some holy irrational shout like Viva Lampur or the Marine Corps forever
[02:09:25] rather than that educated voice which in a saying Freud that was at all odds with the event
[02:09:36] said well it's art or now.
[02:09:42] So you're going to get.
[02:09:44] That's all you're going to get.
[02:09:45] These Marines are getting teleport by machine gun fire by morgur.
[02:09:49] They're getting teleport Marines are falling left and right.
[02:09:51] They're continuing to advance.
[02:09:55] They're continuing to advance and he's watching this group go across this airfield getting
[02:10:01] mode down he wants some kind of motivation and what does he get?
[02:10:12] Well it's our turn now.
[02:10:15] Crazy.
[02:10:17] I bade goodbye to the artist.
[02:10:19] He looked at me sadly from beneath his helmet.
[02:10:22] His face made darker and more angular by its shadow.
[02:10:26] He cast a roof or a glance in the direction of the air strip and the still falling
[02:10:31] men.
[02:10:33] Good luck kid.
[02:10:35] He said and turned away.
[02:10:38] I began to run.
[02:10:40] The heat rose and stifling waves.
[02:10:42] The bullet whispered at times at other times they were not audible.
[02:10:45] I ran with my head low my helmet bumping crazily to obscure my view like waves rising
[02:10:50] around a small ship.
[02:10:54] In a moment I could not see Lieutenant Deep Chest or filthy Fred.
[02:11:00] I was alone in running.
[02:11:01] There were men to my left still falling.
[02:11:05] I ran and threw myself down caught my breath rose again and ran again suddenly I ran
[02:11:10] into a shell crater full of men and I stopped running.
[02:11:15] So the only cover that they have is a shell crater and he dives into this shell crater and
[02:11:21] there are 10 guys are so in there.
[02:11:25] And one of them he's called this one guy walkie talkie back to the book walkie talkie
[02:11:30] sat below me on the crater floor.
[02:11:32] He hunched his shoulders toward me and asked me to twirl certain giles.
[02:11:35] I did but he could not seem to get through.
[02:11:39] That came the screech of a shell.
[02:11:41] I braised my back for it even though I knew that the ones you hear are not the ones
[02:11:45] to be feared.
[02:11:48] That how fear the one that gets you, the one you do not hear.
[02:11:56] Another voice was audible now.
[02:11:59] The fifth Marines lieutenant who was wounded, who was in fact dying as I learned later
[02:12:05] was speaking by walkie talkie to his regimental commander.
[02:12:11] The glorious fifth Marines have gone through sir.
[02:12:15] You were saying and have achieved the objective.
[02:12:19] We are now in contact with the first regiment.
[02:12:31] Now there's 10 guys in there and finally one of the captains speaks up.
[02:12:41] How many men here from the first Marines he asked?
[02:12:44] We raised our hands.
[02:12:46] Six A, that ought to be enough.
[02:12:49] We better take that blockhouse over there.
[02:12:51] That's where all the machine gun fire seems to be coming from.
[02:12:54] As soon as this shell fire stops, we'll move out against it.
[02:12:58] Just like that.
[02:13:00] The blockhouse had resisted even naval gunfire.
[02:13:04] It had taken bombs, point blank, and remained standing.
[02:13:08] It was obviously covered by a maze of pill boxes.
[02:13:12] We six of us were to take it.
[02:13:16] The captain might be stupid, but no one could say that he was not gallant.
[02:13:22] I felt disgusted and resigned myself to an unprofitable death.
[02:13:29] I looked at the men from the fifth who were regarding us with wonder and envy them for having
[02:13:35] retained diplomatic relations with the state of sanity.
[02:13:42] Their commander was hardly conscious now, but he had heard.
[02:13:47] He waved a hand weekly in our direction and grinned as though to say, you'll never make
[02:13:53] it, but there's no harm in trying.
[02:13:57] And of course to a dying man, I suppose there was no harm.
[02:14:03] So, do you think they're going to do it?
[02:14:10] Yep, they're going to do it.
[02:14:11] They're going to charge this blockhouse.
[02:14:12] Six guys, this blockhouse.
[02:14:13] There's just concrete blockhouse, massive machine gunfire coming from it.
[02:14:17] They're going to charge this thing.
[02:14:19] That took bombs, straight up.
[02:14:21] That took direct hits from bombs.
[02:14:25] They make a run for it.
[02:14:27] Back to the book.
[02:14:28] The shells drove us back to our crater.
[02:14:30] Once again, walkie-talkie had difficulty with the apparatus.
[02:14:33] He could receive, but not send, but Italian was asking for positions.
[02:14:37] You better report back to command post.
[02:14:39] Captain said to me, but come back out.
[02:14:42] So lucky wants to go tell command post what's going on.
[02:14:48] He, imagine.
[02:14:49] There's just machine gunfire.
[02:14:51] Mortar's going off everywhere.
[02:14:52] He runs back.
[02:14:53] He gets back to the major.
[02:14:56] At the command post.
[02:14:57] How is it out there, Lucky?
[02:14:59] The major asked.
[02:15:00] Bad sir, I said, adding nothing.
[02:15:03] For my notion of this battle, we'll still confuse jumble of men and movement and explosions
[02:15:08] in which blistering hot, when which a blistering hot airfield was somehow involved.
[02:15:13] Then I rose and said, I better get back out.
[02:15:17] The major nodded and waved.
[02:15:19] Good luck.
[02:15:20] I took firm hold of my Tommy gun and adjusted my pack secured my map case and circle the
[02:15:28] pile of shell casings to return to the shell greater.
[02:15:32] It was my last warlike act.
[02:15:34] For the last time, I set my face toward the enemy.
[02:15:39] About a hundred yards out, a shell exploded in front of me.
[02:15:42] I veered to the right.
[02:15:43] Another shell exploded in front of me.
[02:15:45] I veered more.
[02:15:46] Another shell.
[02:15:47] Another, but closer.
[02:15:48] Four more.
[02:15:49] Another closer still.
[02:15:50] I halted.
[02:15:52] A horrifying fact became clear.
[02:15:54] I had inserted myself between the enemy artillery and their target.
[02:15:58] They were hunting something, perhaps the ammunition dumped behind me and were walking their
[02:16:03] fire in its direction.
[02:16:07] There was no cover.
[02:16:08] To go forward was the die.
[02:16:09] I could only run away from this approaching death, hoping to get out of the target area
[02:16:14] before it caught me.
[02:16:15] I turned and ran.
[02:16:18] I ran with the heat shimmering in waves of, from the coral, with the sweat oiling
[02:16:22] my joints and the fear drying my mouth, with the shells exploding behind me, closer
[02:16:27] ever closer, the airfield, the air filled with the angry voices of shrapnel demanding
[02:16:33] my life.
[02:16:35] I ran with an image in my mind of the Japanese gunner atop his ridge, bringing each
[02:16:40] burst, carefully closer to my flying rear.
[02:16:44] Chasing me across that baking table in a monstrous game of cat and mouse, gleeful at each
[02:16:50] greater burst of speed called forth by a closer explosion.
[02:16:54] And then tiring of sport lifting the gun and dropping one before me.
[02:17:00] A shell landed alongside me, perhaps five feet away, but it did not explode or at least
[02:17:06] I do not think it did, one cannot be certain at such time.
[02:17:11] There is a different space in time with fear.
[02:17:15] But there was a shell at two foot blob of burning red, which struck the coral with a thunder
[02:17:19] flap and seemed to glance off into the air and go wailing away into the bay, with that
[02:17:25] I called upon my remaining strength, and also then the Japanese gunner hit his target.
[02:17:31] The ammunition dump was hit.
[02:17:34] The war ended for me, I had been shattered, no good, a dry husk.
[02:17:41] Modern war had had me, a giant lemon squeezer had crushed me dry, concussion, heat,
[02:17:48] thirst, tension, all had had their way with me.
[02:17:54] I must have stumbled about, unable to speak until at last I sank my knees beside two
[02:17:59] men scratching a foxhole in the sand.
[02:18:02] They were startled.
[02:18:04] As no from afar I could hear them discussing me.
[02:18:08] He can't think what he thinks the matter with him.
[02:18:11] Search me, he don't look wounded, maybe he got a near miss.
[02:18:14] Hey, fella, what's wrong with you?
[02:18:16] Can't you say something?
[02:18:18] What do you think we ought to do with him?
[02:18:22] They rose and pulled me erect, got a shoulder a piece beneath my armpits and dragged me
[02:18:27] like a dummy through the sand.
[02:18:29] Like a life-sized doll in whom the spring had been broken, they dragged me to the doctor.
[02:18:37] A corpsman laid me on the blanket, tied a ticket to me.
[02:18:39] He thrust a needle into my arm, which was attached, a running hose to a bottle of liquid
[02:18:44] suspended upside down on a fray on a wire frame.
[02:18:49] The pair who had brought me, crouched beside me, what's wrong with him, Doc?
[02:18:52] One of the masked.
[02:18:53] I don't know the corpsman answered.
[02:18:55] He's pretty beat up though, blast concussion.
[02:18:58] I'm sending him back to the hospital ship.
[02:19:01] One of the pair looked longingly at the Tommy gun beside me.
[02:19:05] His glance seemed to say you won't need that anymore.
[02:19:07] I told him with my eyes to take it.
[02:19:10] And he slung it over his shoulder with immense satisfaction.
[02:19:13] And they left.
[02:19:14] They had their reward.
[02:19:17] Mortars were falling as they carried me onto the beach with about a half a dozen other casualties.
[02:19:21] We lay there and I wonder, dolly, if the jab gunners were to catch me after all.
[02:19:27] At last, the landing boat took a subordinate reward off for the ship.
[02:19:32] I began to feel shame.
[02:19:35] The others were badly wounded, some put out of pain by morphine and hear I lay in a corner
[02:19:41] quietly wretched like a frightened kitten intact my face on blemished my bones unbroken.
[02:19:50] The war was ending.
[02:19:52] I was ashamed.
[02:19:55] My spirit crept away from the eyes staring, from the staring eyes that fast, fastened
[02:20:01] upon us as the boat was drawn up out of the water to the deck.
[02:20:05] People in white coats throng the rail and two of these at the center gazed with authority
[02:20:10] into the boat searching for the wounded most in need of aid.
[02:20:15] I shrank from that expert stare when suddenly one of them pointed at me and said, him, get
[02:20:22] him downstairs right away.
[02:20:25] They grasped me, stripping me naked as they did and hurried me down a ladder, laying
[02:20:29] me on a table and again frusting a needle into my arm.
[02:20:34] With the liquid flowing into my body came the warm flood of returning self-respect, the
[02:20:39] dull, disperting shame had have disappeared the moment that pointing finger singled me out.
[02:20:46] I had been hurt.
[02:20:47] I wasn't need of aid.
[02:20:50] With a healing power of which he had no inkling, the doctor had restored my spirit to
[02:20:55] me.
[02:20:58] So the war ended for me.
[02:21:01] Each day for a week I ascended the ladder to the deck and gazed in more bed fascination
[02:21:06] that pellu and myel are so away.
[02:21:10] They were still fighting.
[02:21:12] One could hear the sound of the firing.
[02:21:16] Each day the news was bad.
[02:21:19] We were winning.
[02:21:22] But at a fearful price.
[02:21:27] And then the battle had been won.
[02:21:31] The nation had come to the Japanese 10,000 on pellu and my regimen, the first was licking
[02:21:37] its wound wounds on the beach.
[02:21:40] Of my battalion, a force of some 1500 men, the remained but 28 affectives when the command
[02:21:48] came for the last assault on that honeycomb of caves and pillboxes which the Japanese had
[02:21:54] carved into bloody nose ridge.
[02:21:57] In men and blood and agony, the most costly spit of land in the wide Pacific.
[02:22:07] When the command came, they rose from their holes like shades from sepultures and advanced.
[02:22:18] They could not run.
[02:22:20] They could barely walk and they dragged their weapons.
[02:22:24] They obeyed and they attacked.
[02:22:31] They were taken from the line on the brink of collapse.
[02:22:40] Ruffaford was killed.
[02:22:43] He'd been hit by a mortar shell and blown a bit white man had been killed.
[02:22:49] In the artist, the artist was dead, a brave man may he rest in peace.
[02:22:59] Captain Dreadnaut fell dead of a sniper's bullet.
[02:23:06] It had become a hall cost in the fullest sense.
[02:23:13] Scores of others in the battalion sparrished.
[02:23:19] Over those that have not been mentioned in this book, friends who did not fit the narrative,
[02:23:24] men whose faces I have not forgotten and whose bravery and sacrifice has deposited a vast
[02:23:31] spiritual credit for our nation to draw upon.
[02:23:37] These two fell wrestling that island rock from the grasp of its most tenacious defender.
[02:23:49] May they rest in peace.
[02:24:00] Sacrifice says, not the blood of your brother, my friend.
[02:24:09] Your blood.
[02:24:14] That is why women weep when their men go off to war.
[02:24:18] They do not weep for their victims.
[02:24:22] They weep for them as victim.
[02:24:28] That is why with the immemorial insight of mankind, there are gay songs and colorful bands
[02:24:39] to send them off to fortify their failing hearts, not to quicken their lust for blood.
[02:24:52] That is why there are no glorious living.
[02:24:57] That only glorious dead heroes turn traitor warriors age and gross soft, but a victim
[02:25:10] has changed less.
[02:25:28] Sacrifice is eternal.
[02:25:43] And I'll close with the book there.
[02:25:49] Obviously it's an incredible book about incredible men.
[02:25:58] And their eternal sacrifice.
[02:26:10] And it's so humbling to hear of their sacrifice.
[02:26:15] And I say it over and over and over again.
[02:26:18] And I will continue to say that we must live lives worthy of their sacrifice.
[02:26:23] The 7D-100 killed at Guadalcanal, the 2,336 killed at Pelaloo.
[02:26:41] And all the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who as Robert Lecky said later in his life
[02:26:50] who fought or who foremost fighting.
[02:26:57] Phil.
[02:27:05] And I think it's also important to remember the example of Robert Lecky who by his own admission
[02:27:13] was no angel.
[02:27:17] So plaster saint, but who is truly a hero.
[02:27:27] And remember that that people all people have good and bad qualities.
[02:27:33] And people make mistakes and they do dumb things and get those very people are capable
[02:27:41] of so much.
[02:27:48] And yet so often we judge, we judge and we judge and we judge and we cast stones.
[02:28:07] But who are we to judge?
[02:28:13] Who are we to judge when a man like Robert Lecky?
[02:28:19] Lecky Lecky.
[02:28:23] Who not only drank to access and chase girls and pulled up pistol on his superior officer
[02:28:31] and who got so nervous.
[02:28:35] So scared.
[02:28:36] Yes, I'm going to call it scared who got so scared that he would lose control of his
[02:28:43] bladder every time he went to sleep.
[02:28:48] And yet he overcame that fear with more bravery in his heart than most of us can even
[02:28:56] fathom.
[02:29:06] So who are we to judge?
[02:29:09] We shouldn't judge people, we should help them.
[02:29:16] Then there's probably nothing more we can do to live a worthwhile life than to help people.
[02:29:26] To help other people and in helping other people I promise you will be rewarded and you
[02:29:37] will be helping yourself too.
[02:29:46] And one more thing that we see in this book once again is the strength of human will.
[02:29:52] We see men tested beyond anything we can imagine.
[02:30:06] And then when they pass that test one time they get given that test again and then again
[02:30:17] and still they overcome.
[02:30:22] Overcome the pain and the suffering and the fear.
[02:30:31] And yet we can't get ourselves out of bed in the morning.
[02:30:34] We can't move toward a goal we've set for ourselves.
[02:30:39] Don't allow that.
[02:30:48] Remember the tender who river remember the airfield at Guadalcanal remember the discipline
[02:30:56] instilled in every marine at Paris Island.
[02:31:04] And remember what you remember what you are capable of if you mobilize your will.
[02:31:17] And if you keep moving forward you keep advancing.
[02:31:24] Remember what you are capable of if you keep attacking and keeping attacking and keep attacking
[02:31:33] and don't stop.
[02:31:41] Don't stop moving forward and don't stop attacking and don't succumb to the suffering
[02:31:58] and the pain and the fear don't succumb.
[02:32:03] But instead move forward and attack.
[02:32:17] And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
[02:32:25] So echo Charles.
[02:32:27] Yes.
[02:32:28] I'm over here doing a little decompression.
[02:32:33] Maybe you could mobilize your will to let people know how to support this podcast or
[02:32:42] stuff.
[02:32:43] I will make the disclaimer it doesn't take much will to do this.
[02:32:47] But I do see it as a time to decompress a little bit.
[02:32:51] Bro, seriously.
[02:32:53] Yeah.
[02:32:54] Can you even imagine?
[02:32:56] Again, getting tested over and over again.
[02:32:58] You're going through the hardest possible tests with dysentery and a hernia.
[02:33:03] With dysentery, a hernia, you're pissing yourself, your friends are getting killed.
[02:33:08] You pass that test through some miracle.
[02:33:11] And then like, yeah, you got another test.
[02:33:13] Right.
[02:33:14] Yeah.
[02:33:15] But to prepare you for the test we're going to make you suffer more.
[02:33:18] And then you get tested again.
[02:33:20] That's cool.
[02:33:21] But does not doesn't matter.
[02:33:22] It's not the final exam.
[02:33:23] You're going to do it again.
[02:33:26] And again, I say this all the time.
[02:33:28] This is thousands and thousands and thousands of people did this.
[02:33:34] That's what's important to remember.
[02:33:37] This isn't this is a civilian.
[02:33:39] This guy was a civilian.
[02:33:40] Yeah.
[02:33:41] It sounds like this crazy extreme.
[02:33:43] No.
[02:33:44] This is all the cases.
[02:33:45] Yes.
[02:33:46] This is all the cases.
[02:33:47] This is all the cases.
[02:33:48] He talks about he says, look, courage was common.
[02:33:51] There was a rare case where we'd get touched by this fear and it would overtake guys
[02:33:55] and we'd.
[02:33:56] All storm back up the best we could.
[02:33:57] But this isn't an anomaly.
[02:33:59] This isn't the story of the singular hero.
[02:34:03] Right.
[02:34:04] This is the story of thousands and thousands of heroes.
[02:34:07] And this is the story of what people are capable of.
[02:34:09] People are capable of this.
[02:34:11] It's proven.
[02:34:12] And when you think you can't take any more guess what you can.
[02:34:17] Amazing.
[02:34:18] Amazing.
[02:34:19] You know.
[02:34:22] Well, if I got disinterested,
[02:34:26] I wouldn't get out of bed straight up.
[02:34:28] Don't let alone all this other stuff.
[02:34:31] Yeah, I mean, bed.
[02:34:32] Maybe I'd go to the hospital or something like that.
[02:34:33] But then I'd go to hospital.
[02:34:35] Even echo Charles could employ the will in carry on with this entry.
[02:34:42] Yeah.
[02:34:43] I even say you got malaria too, by the way.
[02:34:44] You know, just think of my foot as a friend.
[02:34:47] He got it too.
[02:34:48] This friend got malaria, but he got malaria too.
[02:34:50] Got it.
[02:34:51] That's when they went to look at his hernia.
[02:34:52] They're like, hey, you got to go back to front.
[02:34:54] Oh, but you got malaria.
[02:34:55] Just suffer through that for whatever it is.
[02:34:57] Yeah.
[02:34:58] And that's four days.
[02:34:59] Okay, now you can go back.
[02:35:00] Okay.
[02:35:01] Okay, you're good now.
[02:35:02] Okay.
[02:35:03] Guys, you're just unbelievable.
[02:35:05] I'm trying.
[02:35:06] All right.
[02:35:07] Well, I feel like we should talk about on it then.
[02:35:10] No, that sounds like a great thing to talk about.
[02:35:14] I'll let you talk about it.
[02:35:15] I'm going to sit over here and decompress.
[02:35:17] Well, okay.
[02:35:19] So I'm really glad I'm just kind of goes without saying, but I'm going to say it.
[02:35:23] So I'm glad that we kind of got aligned.
[02:35:27] Well, I mean, I already took shrimp tech before this, but actually, I get technically
[02:35:31] it was you who really made me take krill oil.
[02:35:34] I didn't make you.
[02:35:36] Yeah, but you let's say you influenced me enough to actually take action.
[02:35:41] As they said, but anyway, so it's like kind of I compare like the post krill oil and
[02:35:49] the pre-cruel oil situation.
[02:35:52] So I was, you know, I was into lifting weights and stuff.
[02:35:55] And you know how like weights is a good kind of weights is cool because you know how strong
[02:36:00] you are kind of thing.
[02:36:01] You know, there's a lot of it.
[02:36:02] Yeah, it's pretty black and white.
[02:36:04] There's the number.
[02:36:05] So you can kind of judge like, yeah, this guy's strong or I'm stronger.
[02:36:09] I'm not strong or whatever.
[02:36:10] Right?
[02:36:11] So I considered myself pretty strong in the weight room.
[02:36:13] But, okay, this one time one of our friends came into town, we have, you know, we have
[02:36:18] the weights at the outside and stuff.
[02:36:20] And they're like, oh yeah, you got the weights.
[02:36:23] So he gets under there and he grabs away not heavy, but he grabs them and I'm thinking
[02:36:28] in my head, like, I can do way more than that.
[02:36:31] But then I was like, I can, but I have to warm up a lot first.
[02:36:35] You know, because it's really how strong am I?
[02:36:37] You know, really?
[02:36:38] Anyway, the point there is that was pre-cruel oil.
[02:36:44] I'm not saying I could jump underneath my max.
[02:36:46] No, I'm not saying that.
[02:36:48] I'm saying like my actual strength is closer to my no, non-warm-up strength.
[02:36:55] No.
[02:36:56] That's a good thing.
[02:36:57] You ever seen those videos?
[02:36:59] Where?
[02:37:00] Probably not.
[02:37:01] But go ahead.
[02:37:02] I don't know.
[02:37:03] You remember when they dress up the young professional basketball player or something?
[02:37:09] Oh, it's like under.
[02:37:11] And there's no an old man.
[02:37:12] Oh, yeah.
[02:37:13] Yeah.
[02:37:14] So there's this one.
[02:37:15] I think he's like a pro-crossfit guy or a pro-weight little Olympic lifter or something.
[02:37:19] So he goes to his beaches this whole man.
[02:37:22] And he says, hey, you guys are strong and stuff like that.
[02:37:24] I think he kind of overduzz it in my opinion with acting, but whatever.
[02:37:27] And everyone's believing like, oh, this old man, you know, he probably used to be a weight lifter.
[02:37:31] And he, and he gets under the weight and he's just killing.
[02:37:35] He's in Barry.
[02:37:36] He's just showing up all the guys.
[02:37:38] Beating them.
[02:37:39] You know, lifting them always.
[02:37:40] Then them and whatnot.
[02:37:41] So then he kind of like does his old man walk away.
[02:37:44] That's how I felt before the cruel oil.
[02:37:48] When it's time to lift like I could lift a lot, but like every day life on my kind of stiff, you know, like, I got to like get up after all, you know.
[02:37:57] That's it.
[02:37:58] That's the cruel, cruel oil comparison speech.
[02:38:02] And where would you recommend people get the cruel oil that you speak of so highly?
[02:38:05] Anyway, on it.
[02:38:07] But he, and I looked into that.
[02:38:10] And I'm like, all my prompts lead towards closure.
[02:38:14] Yeah, my goal.
[02:38:15] Yeah, sure.
[02:38:16] No, but I'm saying like, you know, you know, you don't care about my goal.
[02:38:20] You get your own goal.
[02:38:21] Yes, stories to tell.
[02:38:22] Yeah, thanks people want to hear about.
[02:38:24] But I think when I saw those videos, I was like, that was me before a crew.
[02:38:29] Or I really thought that like, well, that's how it feels.
[02:38:31] You know, kind of find it's a funny video to funny thought even really.
[02:38:34] But that's kind of how it feels.
[02:38:35] But I have that problem meeting more.
[02:38:37] You know, I don't feel like that anymore.
[02:38:38] So if someone has seen that video and they might be feeling that that way,
[02:38:43] maybe I can solve it.
[02:38:44] I wish I knew that long time ago.
[02:38:46] Anyway, looked into strong bone.
[02:38:49] Remember we were talking about it last week or whatever.
[02:38:52] And I was like, hey, does it make your bones?
[02:38:54] I gave you a strong moment.
[02:38:55] We had kind of did it.
[02:38:56] I mean, like, when I'm there on it, very resourceful.
[02:38:58] I'm a resourceful person on his very good resource.
[02:39:01] The website.
[02:39:03] And the answer is yes, it does.
[02:39:06] It helps like even like the onset of like osteoporosis, like all this stuff.
[02:39:10] It's like that's that's what it's like.
[02:39:12] I didn't memorize all the terms, but I know the point, but it's,
[02:39:16] oh, yeah, strong team.
[02:39:19] I like the name it after.
[02:39:21] Yes, because strong team calcium, all these things like make it.
[02:39:23] So when you get older and you know, degeneration, you lose that.
[02:39:26] Yeah, I'll in your natural deal, you know,
[02:39:30] maybe and you get the strong bone.
[02:39:32] Strong bone, strong to jump back in your bones easy money.
[02:39:36] So you take the crew away.
[02:39:37] Back in your bones or back in your joints.
[02:39:39] Well, your joints are made up of your bones, tendons, ligaments.
[02:39:43] Does it go into everything?
[02:39:45] It goes into your bones.
[02:39:47] Okay.
[02:39:48] So you figure the tendon connection to your bone.
[02:39:50] That's that's the part that's what you're trying to do up.
[02:39:52] Yeah, that can jam me up.
[02:39:53] That's what you heard right in your bicep.
[02:39:55] Yeah, that's what I heard.
[02:39:57] Yeah, I heard it one day.
[02:39:58] It ripped off my bone, my bicep ripped off my bone.
[02:40:01] Anyway, if I had some strong bone, that one happened.
[02:40:04] Maybe it would have gone up.
[02:40:05] But nonetheless, that is what strong bone helps.
[02:40:08] So guess what I did got some.
[02:40:10] No worries.
[02:40:13] But yeah, there's not just that.
[02:40:16] There's all kinds of cool stuff.
[02:40:18] Warrior bars, that's not how I got more of those.
[02:40:20] Shroom tech for performance and the program.
[02:40:24] Here's the thing, I think sometimes people will kind of mistake the
[02:40:28] Shroom tech when you know, because it helps your oxygen.
[02:40:31] They think that like, I'm going to when I breathe, it has something to do with your breathing.
[02:40:36] You know, it's not your breathing or your lungs.
[02:40:38] It's the amount of oxygen you take up when you breathe.
[02:40:42] So they can go to your muscle.
[02:40:44] That's what it helps.
[02:40:45] So if you go hard, like, super hard or grappling long way called wads.
[02:40:52] Right?
[02:40:53] Where's the day?
[02:40:54] Yeah, yeah.
[02:40:55] It helps.
[02:40:56] Keep to the other red.
[02:40:57] But yeah, go on there.
[02:40:59] For whatever you do, you know, they even work out stuff and whatnot.
[02:41:03] It's actually kind of a fun website.
[02:41:04] You're beyond there for a while looking at the cool stuff.
[02:41:07] That's my opinion.
[02:41:08] And my experience.
[02:41:10] You know, subscribe to the podcast.
[02:41:13] Actually, you know what we'll talk about Amazon first.
[02:41:16] So Amazon click through.
[02:41:17] This is a good way to support podcasts.
[02:41:20] What you do.
[02:41:21] If you don't know already.
[02:41:24] Before you do your Amazon shopping.
[02:41:26] Go to jocopotcast.com.
[02:41:28] Either on the tab on the top left and green or on the top menu.
[02:41:35] Or on the side kind of towards the bottom.
[02:41:39] This is a place to click on.
[02:41:40] Just support through either support.
[02:41:42] Jocopotcast or Amazon click through.
[02:41:44] Anyway, before you do your Amazon shopping, click through there.
[02:41:46] Then do your shopping.
[02:41:49] I actually did that the other day.
[02:41:51] And I don't know if you're watching this on YouTube.
[02:41:54] But if you are, this is what I bought.
[02:41:57] Google just took towing.
[02:42:00] And also, also, if you totally missed this book.
[02:42:05] I didn't, I don't know if I made it clear enough.
[02:42:07] The book that we read today is called Hellment for my pillow.
[02:42:11] By Robert Lecky.
[02:42:13] You can get that Amazon.
[02:42:15] You're going to put it echo.
[02:42:16] We'll have it on the website.
[02:42:17] And we'll click that.
[02:42:18] And you buy it.
[02:42:19] Boom.
[02:42:20] You'll be good to go.
[02:42:21] Yeah.
[02:42:22] You will support the podcast.
[02:42:23] And it's a family.
[02:42:24] And some way, because there'll be somehow being supported.
[02:42:28] Right?
[02:42:29] Because they're owned.
[02:42:30] I'm sure of this book.
[02:42:31] So it's a good way to support this hero, this hero's family.
[02:42:35] And also get the Pacific.
[02:42:38] I don't know if we could put that.
[02:42:40] I don't know.
[02:42:41] But anyways, what?
[02:42:42] Like if you could put it on.
[02:42:44] Click through.
[02:42:45] Unless maybe someone bought the DVDs.
[02:42:47] But watch that.
[02:42:49] And you know what?
[02:42:50] When you watch it.
[02:42:51] And you wrap yourself mentally.
[02:42:53] And don't watch it.
[02:42:54] While there's other things going on.
[02:42:55] Sit down.
[02:42:56] Right.
[02:42:57] On a nice situation, you know, logistically with a good TV set.
[02:43:02] And a good speaker system.
[02:43:04] Throne.
[02:43:05] Yeah.
[02:43:06] And then watch the Pacific.
[02:43:07] And you only.
[02:43:08] Well, they're like, maybe you can watch two at a time.
[02:43:11] Maybe.
[02:43:12] What?
[02:43:13] Two episodes.
[02:43:14] But watch them close together too.
[02:43:15] So you kind of maintain the continuity of the situation.
[02:43:17] Right.
[02:43:18] Because that's good too.
[02:43:19] You see it.
[02:43:20] Man, it's just incredibly well done.
[02:43:22] The thing.
[02:43:23] Yeah.
[02:43:24] It's awesome.
[02:43:25] And then when you have the background of the podcast of the books.
[02:43:28] And you read the books, man.
[02:43:29] It's really.
[02:43:30] Yeah.
[02:43:31] Totally powerful.
[02:43:32] Like, come to me.
[02:43:33] You actually get more into it.
[02:43:34] Oh, for sure.
[02:43:35] You know, like, when you know the guys on the story.
[02:43:36] Yeah.
[02:43:37] For sure.
[02:43:38] You're more invested in the characters.
[02:43:39] Yeah.
[02:43:40] And you realize that when you see lucky lucky in the thing, you have his whole
[02:43:44] backstory.
[02:43:45] It was whole life when you've read the book.
[02:43:47] And it's awesome.
[02:43:48] You know, um, there's a, by the way, that is on the podcast website.
[02:43:53] There's a whole section, whole page with all the books of all the podcast.
[02:43:58] Make it easy for the book situation.
[02:44:01] But yeah.
[02:44:02] So yeah, before you do your Amazon shopping, click through this, the click through the Amazon
[02:44:06] link.
[02:44:07] And then do your shopping.
[02:44:08] And yes, I did buy this item, which I'm showing.
[02:44:11] So if you look on YouTube, you can see it.
[02:44:14] It's to add to our little collection on the table.
[02:44:16] Yeah.
[02:44:19] So yeah, speaking of YouTube, we have a YouTube channel.
[02:44:22] It's good.
[02:44:24] People have been telling me.
[02:44:29] For real, people have been telling me, not just one person, but they say, hey, you should take
[02:44:33] because, okay, on YouTube channel, we have the podcast, of course, the video format.
[02:44:37] Exerps, just like, you know, excerpts from the podcast.
[02:44:40] So you can, like, share them and stuff like that.
[02:44:43] And then there's like, well, what do you call them? What artistic pieces?
[02:44:47] Stuff that I put some like time into, put some track of soundtrack.
[02:44:51] Echo Charles videos.
[02:44:53] Sure. I just called it.
[02:44:54] I forget what I called it.
[02:44:56] Like discipline, something.
[02:44:58] I don't know.
[02:44:59] So you made three categories or two to play.
[02:45:02] So basically, people have been asked me, hey, you should separate them and make them into playlists.
[02:45:07] Which kind of new about, but I'm not deep into the YouTube thing.
[02:45:11] Well, we know that.
[02:45:13] Well, no, as far as the customization and all that, which, which I kind of looked into.
[02:45:17] So this is good.
[02:45:18] What?
[02:45:18] I like about this is people gave you a suggestion, which I saw too.
[02:45:21] You, you looked at it, you explored it, and now you executed on it.
[02:45:25] Yeah, totally did.
[02:45:26] So if there's any other good ideas that people have, they should post them.
[02:45:30] And so that way you can improve even more and we can improve and serve for them better.
[02:45:34] Yeah, I think so. I think that's, and of course, someone going to be like, hey,
[02:45:39] you know, and they'll say an idea, it might not be all that good, but if, or it may not seem like it's all that good.
[02:45:45] But if another person says it, kind of unrelated, you know, not the kind of where some guys should say,
[02:45:50] but do this, you know, make this or create this and then someone just likes it or puts a like on it.
[02:45:56] Or says, yeah.
[02:45:57] So you're asking for multiple.
[02:45:59] Well, not the split hairs, but I'm not asking for anything.
[02:46:03] Oh, I'm saying that's where the actor.
[02:46:05] Yeah, so if someone says a suggestion, maybe the next day, two days, three days later,
[02:46:10] another person says same suggestion, suggestion unrelated.
[02:46:13] And that, ten, the end of the tendency, I see a tendency coming up.
[02:46:17] Then that's when I'd start taking action.
[02:46:19] What about the 14,000 people that told you to make more videos?
[02:46:23] I think in more videos, yes, that's what I thought.
[02:46:25] Yeah, those are, no, because I was watching, I realized I was watching so many,
[02:46:28] I can't remember who was, but I was watching chunks of someone speak the other night, someone that I was, I don't know who was.
[02:46:35] And I was so happy that they were in short clips.
[02:46:38] I was like, this is why we need more short clips.
[02:46:40] Yeah.
[02:46:41] Because it's really convenient to go.
[02:46:43] What's this idea here?
[02:46:44] Boom.
[02:46:45] Yeah.
[02:46:46] You see the name of the video you go.
[02:46:46] Here's the idea.
[02:46:47] I want to think about that idea, boom.
[02:46:48] Yeah.
[02:46:49] You can go.
[02:46:49] And YouTube is good like that where if there's a bunch of them, which, well, I think we're kind of coming up with,
[02:46:54] or collections kind of growing now.
[02:46:55] There's a bud, I'd say there's a bunch of them.
[02:46:57] How well did you execute when people said make when people like episode 42 make a video from this to this?
[02:47:04] How, how did you do any of that?
[02:47:05] Or did you blow everyone off?
[02:47:06] No, no, no.
[02:47:07] Yeah, that's mainly what I've based it on.
[02:47:09] Oh, okay.
[02:47:10] So, but those are, they're everywhere, you know.
[02:47:14] So some of them don't quite translate.
[02:47:17] Some of them, I just, I mean, I don't want to upload like five in one day.
[02:47:21] And I've read some stuff that it's like, no, no, it's not good to do that, but, no, no, that's all, that's all, that's all long story.
[02:47:26] I bet I don't know.
[02:47:28] Let's not just, let's not think about what's good to do and what's not good to do.
[02:47:31] You just gotta get to see what you're trying to get.
[02:47:33] So yeah, you're trying to, yeah, I dig it, man.
[02:47:36] But yeah, YouTube's good like that where if you listen to just the, like, an excerpt,
[02:47:40] we're just a clip two minute three minutes four minutes.
[02:47:42] And you're like, dang, I want to, I want to listen to some more.
[02:47:45] They, not only are they there to listen if you want, but they'll suggest, so you'll have a bit of continuity there.
[02:47:51] Instead of like, oh, I'm locked into this three hour thing right now.
[02:47:54] Right. Well, that's, and that's one thing that's a little bit tricky about this is that when I, when I'm thinking, when I'm talking,
[02:48:01] I'm thinking in the context of this giant two hour thing.
[02:48:04] So sometimes it's hard to snip out something and you lose a little bit in my opinion.
[02:48:09] Yeah, but you also gain a lot because you can get it quick.
[02:48:13] Right. And you can share it with the next guy who's more likely or the next person to more likely, listen to it.
[02:48:20] Yeah. Because even now, man, people will send me, you know, whether it be funny videos, there's this sodium video that,
[02:48:27] you know, the guy skipping a piece of sodium across the lake.
[02:48:31] Yeah. You saw that, it's been going around. I don't know if people look for it and then send it to me or it's been going around.
[02:48:37] So now more people are sending it to me because the last like two weeks, everyone's been sending it to me.
[02:48:43] And I want to actually do that. I want to get the sodium metal.
[02:48:46] And I want to throw it into the water.
[02:48:48] Yeah, we're doing it at some point. Yeah. You're house. I do. If we can find it, I want to do it in film and then just see what I see what up.
[02:48:56] I got to start looking to get some sodium metal.
[02:49:00] But yeah, that's, you know, the, these are good things. These, these YouTube situation made the playlist there on there.
[02:49:10] Exerps, I'm putting more on there.
[02:49:13] There it is.
[02:49:15] Subscribe on iTunes or Stitcher or Google Play and all the podcast platforms.
[02:49:22] You know, that's a good way to support because you're essentially just kind of in the game in general.
[02:49:28] You know, and that's really the thing.
[02:49:31] Because like the more people, you know, they'll hit us on the pun Twitter or just like kind of knowing and knowing what year's talking about or submitting questions.
[02:49:40] This kind of stuff. It does make that circle of like, it's not just juggle telling us what to do.
[02:49:45] It's kind of like we're all in this group, you know.
[02:49:48] Well, yeah, it's like hanging out with your friends basically.
[02:49:54] Like when I go on the road now, like I was just out with some firefighters and like we're all, everyone's telling the same jokes.
[02:50:02] But they're all, you know, we all get it.
[02:50:05] Yeah, exactly.
[02:50:06] So it's cool right now with them because it's like as if they were here. And I was actually talking to them about them.
[02:50:11] Like, well, you know, when it first happened, it would be a little bit strange to me.
[02:50:15] Right.
[02:50:16] Because you don't remember them sitting there because no one was sitting there actually.
[02:50:19] And I was like, well, sometimes it seemed like the podcast was like, was me and echo sitting in a room alone.
[02:50:24] Right.
[02:50:25] But then you realize, no, there's a lot of people sitting in here with us.
[02:50:27] And they have their own spins.
[02:50:30] This is what's funny is people have their own variations on the jokes and on the inside things.
[02:50:35] And I'm like, well, we're talking about so it's all, and you know, they've already taken stuff and spun it out somewhere.
[02:50:40] And now they're bringing it back to me. So I'm part of there.
[02:50:43] Right.
[02:50:44] I get in and get inside their game. So it's pretty funny.
[02:50:47] Yeah.
[02:50:47] And that's not to mention the questions that you answer.
[02:50:50] It's all everyone's questions for sure.
[02:50:52] Yeah, for sure.
[02:50:52] That's not like you're like, let me think of this question that I think people have.
[02:50:56] No, you got it from certain people and you know, answer them there.
[02:51:00] Yeah.
[02:51:01] You know, it's like a two, three way street.
[02:51:04] You do something better.
[02:51:06] Anyway, so yeah, when you're, when you're subscribed, you're, you know, you're kind of in the group.
[02:51:11] Good way to support.
[02:51:13] Also, jacquoise store called jacquoise store.
[02:51:16] Good store.
[02:51:17] Isn't more like the podcast has a store because I don't actually have a store.
[02:51:21] It's the podcast has a store.
[02:51:24] Yeah, yes, technically.
[02:51:26] But you always make it sound like I have a store.
[02:51:28] Yeah, because it's called jacquoise store.
[02:51:30] We have a store.
[02:51:31] Yeah.
[02:51:32] It's not jacquoise store.
[02:51:35] It's jacquoise store.
[02:51:36] Okay.
[02:51:37] Seems same.
[02:51:38] I'm going to concede to the point.
[02:51:40] There it is.
[02:51:41] Boom.
[02:51:42] I have a store.
[02:51:43] That's what I don't like about it.
[02:51:44] I don't know.
[02:51:45] But when I say it, I think it sounds cool.
[02:51:48] Sure.
[02:51:49] It's on there.
[02:51:50] If you want to wear T shirts and represent.
[02:51:53] Got a new design out there.
[02:51:55] Well, kind of new two weeks, three weeks, maybe.
[02:51:58] Yeah.
[02:51:59] And actually it's a new T shirt design.
[02:52:01] It could be found in other places.
[02:52:04] Oh, yeah.
[02:52:05] Right.
[02:52:06] Sure.
[02:52:07] What do you mean?
[02:52:08] I mean.
[02:52:09] All right.
[02:52:10] Great.
[02:52:11] We found in other places.
[02:52:12] Yeah, man.
[02:52:13] It's good.
[02:52:14] But hey, look.
[02:52:15] Like on the get after it.
[02:52:16] That's where it could be found straight up.
[02:52:17] I don't want to try.
[02:52:18] It's a little game here.
[02:52:19] Like I wasn't going to say anything.
[02:52:20] It's the get after it.
[02:52:21] We got to shirt this as get after it.
[02:52:23] And now one came highly recommended.
[02:52:25] Perfect.
[02:52:26] Perfect example of people saying, you know,
[02:52:28] people were saying it so like like mad.
[02:52:31] It's the fact is yeah, where it was to the point where they were like,
[02:52:35] Hey, you should you should do it.
[02:52:37] Get after it.
[02:52:38] Sure.
[02:52:38] They weren't saying that anymore.
[02:52:39] They were saying when the get after it.
[02:52:41] Sure.
[02:52:41] Come out when do they come out?
[02:52:42] I didn't know we were doing that yet.
[02:52:44] But apparently we are so boom.
[02:52:46] They're out.
[02:52:47] They got you.
[02:52:48] They got you with psychological work.
[02:52:49] Man, I'm glad they did.
[02:52:50] Because I think they turned out good.
[02:52:52] I'm real simple.
[02:52:53] Like most things.
[02:52:54] You know, these shirts are cool.
[02:52:55] I think.
[02:52:56] But go to jockelstore.com and look at them.
[02:52:59] You think they're cool.
[02:53:00] You think you want to wear one represent in the wild.
[02:53:03] Go ahead.
[02:53:04] Get one support one now.
[02:53:06] I also some, you know, some women stuff out there.
[02:53:10] Women might be underrepresented overall.
[02:53:13] But I think that the women that are kind of in the game that listen.
[02:53:19] They get after it.
[02:53:20] They get after it hard to make up for the numbers.
[02:53:23] You know, you seem saying like the quality.
[02:53:25] It's greater than the quantity.
[02:53:27] Anyway, I got some patches on there too.
[02:53:29] The rash guards, of course.
[02:53:30] I'm going to put a new one out.
[02:53:31] It's in the works.
[02:53:32] It's like ready to be pushed out in a few days.
[02:53:36] I think maybe a week.
[02:53:38] So yeah, if you're into jiu-jitsu, that's why I think that's the primary reason I made them.
[02:53:44] But they're actually for surfing.
[02:53:47] Body boarding.
[02:53:49] What jockels?
[02:53:50] Spunging.
[02:53:51] Spud.
[02:53:52] Cycling.
[02:53:53] Crossfit.
[02:53:54] Any kind of workout where you need, you know, like maximum mobility, but you still want to go with like a shirt on.
[02:54:00] Sometimes you just go no shirt.
[02:54:03] But yeah.
[02:54:04] If you go no shirt, you're not supported in the podcast.
[02:54:07] Correct.
[02:54:08] Correct.
[02:54:09] And, you know, that the, I think, you know, we kind of did some calculations.
[02:54:14] I think the new rash guard might, I'm not saying it will because we don't know yet.
[02:54:17] They're not here.
[02:54:18] They might yield.
[02:54:19] Was it 24?
[02:54:21] Oh, so echo did.
[02:54:23] He's got the sample one.
[02:54:25] You'll want some.
[02:54:26] And the sample one, you said, give you like 27%
[02:54:30] I thought I'm a bandage.
[02:54:32] 24.
[02:54:33] But you know what, now that you mentioned it, I think it was 27.
[02:54:35] Yeah.
[02:54:36] Yes.
[02:54:37] Up from 19.
[02:54:38] Yeah, which is a lot.
[02:54:39] But that's only one case study.
[02:54:41] So that's what I'm saying.
[02:54:42] We're really good at, um, double blind.
[02:54:44] Ten.
[02:54:45] This is actually true where I went and I practiced.
[02:54:47] I did some rounds.
[02:54:48] And you look like when you're done rounds and you're kind of talking with the boys afterwards.
[02:54:51] Yeah.
[02:54:52] And girls in our case because Kaylee was there too.
[02:54:54] We're talking.
[02:54:55] And I thought we were done.
[02:54:56] We were done.
[02:54:57] Somebody called.
[02:54:58] You're like, hey guys, co.
[02:54:59] And then David,
[02:55:01] Sesame's bulia.
[02:55:03] He's like, oh, hold the holdings.
[02:55:05] Yeah.
[02:55:06] nephew, like, actually actual nephew, like,
[02:55:09] his dad's brother or something.
[02:55:11] I might get that part wrong.
[02:55:12] But it's yeah, anyway.
[02:55:13] That's a side note.
[02:55:14] He called you out.
[02:55:15] Yeah.
[02:55:16] Well, he asks.
[02:55:17] He wants to roll in and go.
[02:55:18] He goes, what?
[02:55:22] It's to the rounds left.
[02:55:23] Shrimp tech.
[02:55:24] Rashguard.
[02:55:25] That's it.
[02:55:26] Yeah.
[02:55:26] We've got it wrong with the lead.
[02:55:27] Anyway, yeah.
[02:55:28] Good.
[02:55:28] Good deal.
[02:55:29] Good experience.
[02:55:30] But that's got a good deep half guard.
[02:55:32] Yeah.
[02:55:33] He has good.
[02:55:34] Yeah.
[02:55:34] Yeah.
[02:55:34] But he's deep half guard.
[02:55:35] He's got because he's, he's a bigger dude.
[02:55:37] But he got the depth of the guard.
[02:55:39] Yeah.
[02:55:39] He's bigger than Jeff.
[02:55:40] He's got a good.
[02:55:41] He's trimmed up a little bit.
[02:55:42] But nonetheless, yeah, good.
[02:55:44] Good training.
[02:55:45] Also.
[02:55:46] Psychological work.
[02:55:47] Psychological warfare.
[02:55:48] So if you know what that is, it's an album with tracks, juggle talking.
[02:55:54] But he's not just talking.
[02:55:56] He's talking with the intent of getting you through any moments of weakness that you might
[02:56:01] have in your getting after it journey.
[02:56:05] Isn't it goes beyond might have?
[02:56:07] Right.
[02:56:08] It goes into actual moments of weakness.
[02:56:09] Not that you are in a moment of weakness.
[02:56:11] You're looking at actual donuts.
[02:56:13] They're in front of you.
[02:56:14] Right.
[02:56:15] They're breaking you down mentally.
[02:56:16] Right.
[02:56:17] Don't click that.
[02:56:18] No.
[02:56:19] Hit play.
[02:56:20] Hit play.
[02:56:21] Get the track in there.
[02:56:22] The actual monotopotential moment of weakness.
[02:56:23] They're the moment of weakness is upon us.
[02:56:24] We're going to feed it.
[02:56:26] Yeah.
[02:56:27] Psychological warfare.
[02:56:28] Yeah.
[02:56:29] And we're getting requests now for the second one.
[02:56:31] Yeah.
[02:56:32] So I'm going to start thinking about that.
[02:56:34] What that's going to be like.
[02:56:35] Yeah.
[02:56:36] And if you want recommendations of what particular moments of weakness that you might have that
[02:56:39] need to be overcome.
[02:56:40] And there's a common theme as echo referred to.
[02:56:43] And if it's got to be something that I've dealt with before.
[02:56:47] Right.
[02:56:48] Because I can't just make up some way of overcoming a weakness that I've never experienced.
[02:56:54] Now I've experienced a lot of weaknesses.
[02:56:56] But if you come up with something that I've never experienced, then we're going to have to just
[02:57:00] forgo that one.
[02:57:01] Because I'm not going to make it up for go.
[02:57:03] I'm not going to make up with the brand might not work.
[02:57:05] Right.
[02:57:06] It's hard to manufacture.
[02:57:07] You can manufacture in Sparado.
[02:57:08] That's the great.
[02:57:10] Yeah.
[02:57:13] Yeah.
[02:57:14] I got some.
[02:57:15] Oh, talk about that.
[02:57:16] It's from a quiet dude.
[02:57:17] That's where it's going to come from.
[02:57:19] Sure.
[02:57:20] A still one.
[02:57:21] That's a quiet dude.
[02:57:22] That's a good on psychological warfare.
[02:57:25] Joccal wheeling.
[02:57:26] iTunes, Amazon music.
[02:57:28] All those good.
[02:57:29] It's probably any music outlet.
[02:57:30] A bunch of music outlets here.
[02:57:32] Yeah.
[02:57:33] Yeah.
[02:57:34] Just jump on that.
[02:57:34] It helps.
[02:57:35] And I use it.
[02:57:36] I don't recommend this.
[02:57:37] But I used it.
[02:57:39] I don't feel like working out.
[02:57:40] This is a big thing for me because I kind of had it like that.
[02:57:42] Well, I'll be like, oh, I'm just going to rest because I don't feel like I didn't get nine hours of sleep songs to it tomorrow.
[02:57:48] No.
[02:57:49] Yeah.
[02:57:50] Man, and it really worked with that.
[02:57:52] The workout one.
[02:57:53] A guy, you know, you said it works 100% of the time.
[02:57:56] Yes.
[02:57:57] Like the wake up one.
[02:57:58] Yeah.
[02:57:59] Because there's three wake up tracks.
[02:58:00] A guy on Twitter said a number of wake up track didn't work.
[02:58:04] It failed.
[02:58:05] Interesting.
[02:58:06] And then he said, but I made it to the number two.
[02:58:08] Wake up track, which is the way they're set.
[02:58:10] They're set like you listen to one.
[02:58:12] That's going to get you up.
[02:58:13] But if it doesn't number two is waiting.
[02:58:14] Right.
[02:58:15] And you got the number two and then he woke up.
[02:58:16] So we're still batting a thousand.
[02:58:19] Overall.
[02:58:20] Yeah.
[02:58:21] The overall campaign, right?
[02:58:22] Yeah.
[02:58:22] The campaign is a win.
[02:58:23] But we did take a bigger from one dude that just didn't get out of bed after listening to psychological warfare.
[02:58:29] Get out of bed track for one.
[02:58:31] He had to go to track to.
[02:58:32] But we're there.
[02:58:33] Yeah.
[02:58:34] He had some reserves.
[02:58:35] Got some backup.
[02:58:36] That's what we had for that.
[02:58:37] But I don't think anyone's made it to three yet.
[02:58:39] No one's made it to the wake up track for you.
[02:58:41] And then they're, yeah.
[02:58:42] That must to make it even to make it to two.
[02:58:44] You must be one tired dude.
[02:58:45] You must have had like a hard night.
[02:58:48] Night.
[02:58:48] And then before.
[02:58:49] And you must have hard workout waiting for your son on it on something.
[02:58:52] But yeah.
[02:58:53] I mean, my experience hundred percent success rate.
[02:58:55] But I don't.
[02:58:56] And then I started doing it just because just because I want to get fired up.
[02:59:01] Yeah.
[02:59:02] And it's weird because it's not.
[02:59:03] It's not that.
[02:59:07] It's almost like this.
[02:59:08] Yeah.
[02:59:09] Some people say to me, Hey, can you do one of you yelling?
[02:59:11] I'm like, Why don't we yell a lot, man?
[02:59:13] Like I didn't get on my yeller.
[02:59:15] Yeah.
[02:59:16] Now, let me see the me present.
[02:59:17] If we're in the gym and like I'm pushing someone like a MMA fighter.
[02:59:21] That's in a workout.
[02:59:22] I'm going to come on.
[02:59:23] You know, I might raise my voice a little bit.
[02:59:24] But I'm not going to yell at you.
[02:59:26] You know, the drone structure type thing.
[02:59:29] It's not this not.
[02:59:30] Yeah.
[02:59:31] What I do and I could see maybe like how that could be effective.
[02:59:34] But in these cases, that's not the mood you're in anywhere.
[02:59:37] You know what?
[02:59:38] It could be effective for certain instances.
[02:59:40] Yes.
[02:59:41] And actually, like I've been doing some little videos in the morning.
[02:59:44] Oh, and and and I realize when I watch them,
[02:59:48] that I'm getting a little bit aggressive with the way I'm talking.
[02:59:51] And it's not.
[02:59:52] It's not like I'm saying, Okay, I could.
[02:59:53] No, I'm just starting to talk and then I start getting naturally.
[02:59:56] I start escalating my own situation because I'm starting to think about when I'm
[03:00:00] saying it means something to me.
[03:00:03] Right.
[03:00:04] So when I'm saying hey, you know, you're wasting your life right now.
[03:00:06] I start thinking, I feel in that way because I know that there's someone that's actually
[03:00:10] wasting their life right now.
[03:00:11] And so it starts, you know, getting a little bit escalated.
[03:00:15] And so maybe on psychological warfare too, there'll be some situation that
[03:00:20] that I personally escalate on.
[03:00:23] Yeah.
[03:00:24] What does it be natural, right?
[03:00:25] Kind of thing.
[03:00:26] Yeah.
[03:00:27] Because you can have manufacturer in Sparato.
[03:00:28] Yeah.
[03:00:29] There he go.
[03:00:30] But yeah, it's good.
[03:00:31] It's like because you just kind of explain, like kind of the logic behind it.
[03:00:35] Like see what you're doing right now.
[03:00:37] But do you see that?
[03:00:38] Yeah.
[03:00:38] Well, I guess now I do shoot.
[03:00:40] Then you get up.
[03:00:41] You know, yeah, I use it when it's now.
[03:00:44] Sometimes I abuse it.
[03:00:45] Well, I don't know.
[03:00:46] I'm feeling fired up and just put it in.
[03:00:47] Get more fired up.
[03:00:48] Get talked into feeling even better.
[03:00:51] That's how dangerous things are.
[03:00:53] It's like a lot of work.
[03:00:54] It's good one.
[03:00:55] Also when you're clicking through Amazon, you can also get
[03:00:57] a good chocolate tea, which it may not seem like a big deal.
[03:01:02] And maybe it isn't, but maybe it is.
[03:01:05] I tell you, judging from some of the, some of the reviews on Amazon, I'm really doing.
[03:01:13] After drinking, jacquawait tea, I found I was overcome with the insurmountable urge to get after it.
[03:01:20] So much so that I was able to defeat all my foes in a short amount of time on a side
[03:01:26] note, I found that jacquawait tea is best served over ice and consumed from the skulls of dead enemies.
[03:01:32] Now, you know, I don't know what situation this individual is in, right?
[03:01:37] But obviously he's in combat situation.
[03:01:39] He's got foes that need to be killed and he's drinking from their skulls.
[03:01:43] And even in that really stressful environment, you know, the tea's helping him, which is cool.
[03:01:48] I'm glad that it's helping him doing positive things against the enemies of good in the world.
[03:01:54] Also, good evening, echo in jacquaw, I woke up weighing 115 pounds the day the white tea arrives.
[03:02:01] Two cups later I re-weight myself and I was now roughly 250 pounds.
[03:02:05] So he more than doubled his body weight after two cups of jacquawait tea.
[03:02:11] I think my tea was a little loaded and obviously gave me more than the 20% increase in gains that was promised.
[03:02:18] And I don't think we actually promised anything. I didn't promise that, but I think it kind of speaks for itself.
[03:02:23] And this is the important. This is why I wanted to make this one very important.
[03:02:28] Also, cruising went up roughly 200%. So there's that as well.
[03:02:34] So yeah, it's very bad for everybody.
[03:02:36] Well, you know, and there you go. Scientific cruising is up 200% which is positive.
[03:02:43] Also, way of the warrior kid, I got the first hard coffee.
[03:02:48] I got it in my hands. They sent me one. They're sending me more.
[03:02:53] But, you know, how dang it's three hours right now.
[03:02:57] We've been talking for three hours.
[03:02:59] That's my fault.
[03:03:01] Oh, man, that's a long time.
[03:03:03] And I was going to read a little excerpt.
[03:03:06] And I think I'm going to do this.
[03:03:08] It's already been three hours.
[03:03:09] But, but so, young Mark is, he's going to jump off this bridge.
[03:03:17] He couldn't swim in the beginning of the book.
[03:03:19] Now he knows how to swim.
[03:03:20] But his goal is to jump off the bridge into the river.
[03:03:22] And he goes up there to do it.
[03:03:24] And he's scared. He gets scared. He's not going to just, he just can't jump.
[03:03:28] So Uncle Jake, who used to be a seal?
[03:03:32] Who's now with his young nephew trying to show him the warrior way.
[03:03:35] Goes up on the bridge.
[03:03:37] And he said, what's going on, buddy?
[03:03:38] He said in a calm voice, I don't know.
[03:03:40] I said, I'm just, I'm just, you're afraid, aren't you?
[03:03:44] Uncle Jake asked.
[03:03:46] But he wasn't even asking.
[03:03:48] He knew. He knew I was scared.
[03:03:51] There was no point denying it.
[03:03:54] Uncle Jake knew it as plain as day.
[03:03:57] Yes.
[03:03:59] I finally said in a quiet tone, two embarrassed that I was afraid.
[03:04:03] Then, to my surprise, Uncle Jake said, that's normal.
[03:04:07] What? I responded?
[03:04:10] Shocked at Uncle Jake statement.
[03:04:12] I said, that's normal.
[03:04:14] You're doing something you've never done before, so it's normal to be a little hesitant.
[03:04:18] It's called fear.
[03:04:20] It's a normal emotion, and it's okay.
[03:04:24] Then he added, well, it's okay as long as you can control it.
[03:04:29] This made no sense to me.
[03:04:31] How am I supposed to control fear?
[03:04:33] And how would you know? You're not afraid of anything.
[03:04:37] Uncle Jake sat quietly for a minute.
[03:04:40] Then he said, I wish that were true.
[03:04:45] What do you mean? I asked him.
[03:04:48] Well, you said, I'm not afraid of anything.
[03:04:51] And that is just not true.
[03:04:53] Fear is normal.
[03:04:54] In fact, fear is good.
[03:04:57] Fear is what warns you and things are dangerous.
[03:05:00] Fear is what makes you prepare.
[03:05:02] Fear keeps us out of a lot of trouble.
[03:05:05] So there's nothing wrong with fear.
[03:05:08] But fear can also be overwhelming.
[03:05:11] It can be unreasonable.
[03:05:13] It can cause you to freeze up and make bad decisions or hesitate when you need to act.
[03:05:20] So you have to learn to control fear,
[03:05:24] and that's what you need to do right now.
[03:05:28] Okay, that sounds great, and I would really love to make you happy and overcome my fear,
[03:05:33] but I don't know how.
[03:05:35] Uncle Jake thought about that.
[03:05:38] About what I just said for a few seconds, and then he said, okay, well,
[03:05:44] the first part of controlling fear you've already done.
[03:05:47] And that is preparation.
[03:05:49] You've done plenty of preparation to be ready for this moment to face this fear.
[03:05:55] Starting with dunking your head,
[03:05:57] all the way up to swimming all around and back and forth across this river,
[03:06:00] you've done little jumps off the riverbank.
[03:06:04] All of the last several weeks have been preparing you for this, this jump.
[03:06:09] And all that preparation works to help overcome the fear.
[03:06:14] Imagine how scared you would be if you still didn't know how to swim.
[03:06:18] You would be horrified, but you have prepared.
[03:06:22] Then why am I still scared?
[03:06:24] I asked Uncle Jake simple, he said,
[03:06:27] because there's still an element of the unknown.
[03:06:30] You've never jumped off anything this high before, so you don't know what it feels like.
[03:06:35] People are afraid of what they don't know or what they don't understand,
[03:06:40] but you have prepared.
[03:06:42] You know it is safe, you know you are ready.
[03:06:46] It's just this last little bit of fear that has to be overcome.
[03:06:50] And you know how you do that?
[03:06:52] I have no idea, I told him, you go.
[03:06:57] Just go, I asked Uncle Jake,
[03:07:00] now partly thinking he was just joking, yes, you just go.
[03:07:04] You see fear lives in the moment,
[03:07:06] that powerful moment between when you decide you are going to do something
[03:07:10] and when you do it.
[03:07:12] Once you go, once you start, you won't be afraid anymore.
[03:07:16] You overcome fear by going.
[03:07:19] And it is the same in many aspects of life,
[03:07:22] parachuting, talking in front of a crowd,
[03:07:24] taking a test, running a race, competing in jujitsu.
[03:07:28] The fear is in the waiting.
[03:07:31] So, once you have planned,
[03:07:34] once you have prepared and trained and studied,
[03:07:38] there is only one thing left to do.
[03:07:41] Go.
[03:07:43] And that's it?
[03:07:44] Yes, that's it.
[03:07:47] As soon as Uncle Jake finished those words,
[03:07:49] he stood up, looked at me, yelled out,
[03:07:52] who y'all jumped off the bridge.
[03:07:55] Just go, I fought to myself.
[03:07:58] I stood up, stepped up onto the edge of the wall
[03:08:01] and looked down at Uncle Jake,
[03:08:03] who had just come back to the surface
[03:08:04] and was looking up at me with a big smile on his face.
[03:08:07] With all my heart and lungs, I yelled out,
[03:08:10] who y'all, and stepped off the bridge,
[03:08:13] passed my fear and into the unknown.
[03:08:16] I felt myself falling for a while
[03:08:19] and didn't wish I was in the water.
[03:08:22] I came to the surface and had a big smile on my face.
[03:08:26] I can fly, I yelled, I can fly.
[03:08:31] So, little excerpt.
[03:08:35] Dang, that was good, man.
[03:08:37] On the way of the warrior kid, it comes out May 2nd.
[03:08:40] So, go and go order the book for you,
[03:08:46] for your kid, for your neighbor, for your nephew,
[03:08:49] for your niece, for the school of library, whatever.
[03:08:53] Order them so the publisher, that's making this book.
[03:08:57] We want them to know that they need to print a bunch of these.
[03:09:01] They don't know that right now.
[03:09:03] They don't know how many kids want to get after it.
[03:09:06] They don't know that.
[03:09:09] They don't know that.
[03:09:11] And they're not going to print enough.
[03:09:13] It's the same thing that happened with Jockel White Team, right?
[03:09:16] You remember that?
[03:09:17] That's shortage.
[03:09:18] The anger of the frustration, the nation-wide-19% drop-in performance across the board.
[03:09:23] You remember that?
[03:09:24] Don't let it happen here, same thing.
[03:09:26] In order that, you can also pre-order,
[03:09:29] discipline equals freedom, field manual,
[03:09:31] comes out October 17th, 1717.
[03:09:35] Hmm, that's the book that you asked for.
[03:09:42] So you can order that one too, and of course,
[03:09:44] extreme ownership.
[03:09:46] You can get that one, people buy it,
[03:09:48] and then they buy it for their team, and it spreads.
[03:09:50] So pick that up for you and your team up and down the chain of command,
[03:09:53] extreme ownership.
[03:09:55] Beyond that, if you want some direct action and interaction with your company that you work out,
[03:10:02] you can contact our company,
[03:10:05] Eshelon Front, Me, Lave Babin,
[03:10:08] JP D'Nel, Dave Burke.

[03:10:30] And of course, probably most important echo Charles, he's going to be there.
[03:10:36] And he might try and hide, but he can't.
[03:10:40] Because none of us can, because there's no green room, there's no backstage,
[03:10:43] there's just all of us together, getting after it.
[03:10:48] And of course, before the monster, you can find us.
[03:10:53] What are you cruising?
[03:10:55] Kind of hard on the Interwebs on Twitter, on Instagram,
[03:11:01] and in the face, the book.
[03:11:05] Echo is at Echo Charles, and I am at Jockawilling.
[03:11:12] And finally, thanks to all the service men and women out there who,
[03:11:18] in this uncertain world, and it certainly is an uncertain world today,
[03:11:25] filled with evil, all of you that walk away from the comforts of home, and into the unknown,
[03:11:34] to face our enemies.
[03:11:38] Thank you, to the firefighters, police and law enforcement, EMTs, and the first responders here at home.
[03:11:46] Thank you for what you do day in and day out, putting yourself at risk for us,
[03:11:54] and to everyone else out there, facing what you're facing.
[03:12:01] Challenges that work and challenges with family and challenges with yourself and challenges in your head and challenges with life.
[03:12:14] Remember what you, as a human being, are capable of remember what your will is capable of.
[03:12:27] And then keep moving forward, keep attacking, and keep getting after it.
[03:12:41] So, until next time, this is Echo and Jockaw.
[03:12:47] Out.
