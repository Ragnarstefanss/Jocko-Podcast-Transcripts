00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.94 This is Jockel Podcast number 240.
00:00:03.94 --> 00:00:06.88 With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:06.88 --> 00:00:07.88 Good evening, Echo.
00:00:07.88 --> 00:00:10.92 Good evening, and also doing us tonight.
00:00:10.92 --> 00:00:13.000 Once again, Dave Burke.
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000 Good evening, Dave.
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000 Good evening.
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.40 All right, last podcast, which was podcast 2.39, in case you couldn't subtract one from
00:00:22.40 --> 00:00:23.40 240.
00:00:23.40 --> 00:00:26.76 And I suppose we should give out some kind of shout out to the 240 Gulf.
00:00:26.76 --> 00:00:29.96 I don't know why, but we should.
00:00:29.96 --> 00:00:35.04 Shout out to all you machine gunners out there that ran that 240 Gulf.
00:00:35.04 --> 00:00:43.04 Last podcast, 239, we covered the first edition of combat lessons, rank and file in combat,
00:00:43.04 --> 00:00:45.04 what they do and how they do it.
00:00:45.04 --> 00:00:46.04 That was number one.
00:00:46.04 --> 00:00:50.64 And you know, to be honest, when I got done with that one, I said, yeah, that's cool.
00:00:50.64 --> 00:00:52.04 But there's more of them.
00:00:52.04 --> 00:00:58.72 And I kind of thought to myself, you know, well, how many combat lessons are there, right?
00:00:58.72 --> 00:01:03.48 I remember this is 240 podcast worth of combat lessons.
00:01:03.48 --> 00:01:07.08 But I was leaning towards, hey, probably not going to cover more of these things, because
00:01:07.08 --> 00:01:08.40 they're on more of them.
00:01:08.40 --> 00:01:11.12 And then I started reading number two.
00:01:11.12 --> 00:01:16.000 And as I read number two, kind of out of the gate section one, which is called leadership,
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.52 and you just get, you just restart reading it.
00:01:18.52 --> 00:01:23.52 And before I knew it, I couldn't stop and there's more lessons, more perspectives,
00:01:23.52 --> 00:01:26.84 more angles, more knowledge to make us better.
00:01:26.84 --> 00:01:29.000 And I was really coming at this one.
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.68 I was really thinking about life a lot, all aspects of life.
00:01:33.68 --> 00:01:39.92 And I think it's the opening of this that gave me that sort of mindset going through it.
00:01:39.92 --> 00:01:43.48 I was thinking about life, the parallels, or everywhere.
00:01:43.48 --> 00:01:46.08 All right, let's go to the book.
00:01:46.08 --> 00:01:52.000 And I think Dave, coming out of the gate, you're going to realize where, why I got so sucked
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.76 into this thing, just out of the gate.
00:01:53.76 --> 00:01:56.32 So the first section, like I said, it's called leadership.
00:01:56.32 --> 00:02:04.24 And then the first subsection is leaders versus inertia.
00:02:04.24 --> 00:02:08.40 I was already, I was, you had me at inertia, as they say.
00:02:08.40 --> 00:02:13.68 Lieutenant Colonel, our E.O. Brian Cavalry observer with the fifth army in Italy.
00:02:13.68 --> 00:02:15.44 Here's what he says.
00:02:15.44 --> 00:02:20.08 In spite of the fact that I observed many interesting things in practice, in the practice
00:02:20.08 --> 00:02:24.64 of tactics and technique, still the one lesson that stands out in my mind above all others
00:02:24.64 --> 00:02:29.40 is the one that is so well-known by military men that it's statement here amounts to a little
00:02:29.40 --> 00:02:30.56 more than a platitude.
00:02:30.56 --> 00:02:35.92 I mentioned it however, because it had such a profound effect upon me, that lesson is the
00:02:35.92 --> 00:02:41.04 importance of and need for adequate leadership.
00:02:41.04 --> 00:02:42.04 So cool.
00:02:42.04 --> 00:02:43.04 I got through that.
00:02:43.04 --> 00:02:46.28 Fine, I wasn't quite there yet.
00:02:46.28 --> 00:02:48.92 And then I read this.
00:02:48.92 --> 00:02:59.04 The effect on most men of the impact of battle is to cause them to want to do nothing.
00:02:59.04 --> 00:03:04.28 A determined effort must be exerted to accomplish even simple tasks, and men are likely
00:03:04.28 --> 00:03:08.52 to neglect duties which they know must be performed.
00:03:08.52 --> 00:03:10.08 So think about that.
00:03:10.08 --> 00:03:11.60 Right out of the gate, right there.
00:03:11.60 --> 00:03:15.68 The effect of men in battle is that you're going to want to do nothing.
00:03:15.68 --> 00:03:19.80 And again, this is why I was talking about how this started making me think about life a
00:03:19.80 --> 00:03:20.80 lot.
00:03:20.80 --> 00:03:23.40 Think about that when it comes to life.
00:03:23.40 --> 00:03:29.16 How many people are just drawn towards the easy path not doing what you're supposed
00:03:29.16 --> 00:03:35.32 to do duties that you know must be performed but you neglect them.
00:03:35.32 --> 00:03:38.44 That's the difference between success and failure in life, by the way.
00:03:38.44 --> 00:03:44.44 Did you guys say in the Marine Corps why stand if you can sit, why sit if you can lay
00:03:44.44 --> 00:03:45.44 down?
00:03:45.44 --> 00:03:46.44 I'm going to say that in the Marine Corps.
00:03:46.44 --> 00:03:47.44 Similar.
00:03:47.44 --> 00:03:48.44 What do you guys say?
00:03:48.44 --> 00:03:50.60 I'm trying to think of the phrase but it's the same.
00:03:50.60 --> 00:03:53.44 I'm just like why do this when you can just do that?
00:03:53.44 --> 00:03:54.44 I never would say what I'm saying.
00:03:54.44 --> 00:03:58.60 But as soon as you say that, I know you were saying I was little thrown off by the title.
00:03:58.60 --> 00:04:00.44 Because you said leadership versus inertia.
00:04:00.44 --> 00:04:02.96 Now, it's thinking myself.
00:04:02.96 --> 00:04:04.52 Leadership kind of creates inertia.
00:04:04.52 --> 00:04:08.64 And when he's saying stand and the people who fall like Newtonian physics are going to
00:04:08.64 --> 00:04:10.40 laugh me out of the building.
00:04:10.40 --> 00:04:13.72 But it seems like what he's describing is the opposite of inertia sitting there doing nothing
00:04:13.72 --> 00:04:16.000 rather than moving in a direction.
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.80 Or it's the you're fighting to keep it going.
00:04:18.80 --> 00:04:19.80 Yeah.
00:04:19.80 --> 00:04:20.80 And inertia moving.
00:04:20.80 --> 00:04:21.80 Yeah.
00:04:21.80 --> 00:04:26.40 He says there is no force other than a driving leadership to overcome this inertia.
00:04:26.40 --> 00:04:30.04 So he talks about inertia as the static being not moving.
00:04:30.04 --> 00:04:35.08 This tendency to carelessness and to infuse a determination to succeed in the minds of the
00:04:35.08 --> 00:04:37.56 individual men.
00:04:37.56 --> 00:04:43.000 When this spark of leadership is present, the individual knows that others feel it too.
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.88 And that his effort is not alone.
00:04:44.88 --> 00:04:47.88 However, I was not a leader in this campaign.
00:04:47.88 --> 00:04:53.20 So I will quote an officer who is a successful commander in an infantry regiment, the wearer
00:04:53.20 --> 00:04:57.44 of a silver star an officer who has a fine reputation in his division.
00:04:57.44 --> 00:05:01.16 And here's what this officer says.
00:05:01.16 --> 00:05:08.08 This tell your people when you return that the hardest job they will have here is getting
00:05:08.08 --> 00:05:10.28 things done.
00:05:10.28 --> 00:05:12.88 My men know their weapons and tactics thoroughly.
00:05:12.88 --> 00:05:19.24 My effort is simply to require them to do the things they know must be done.
00:05:19.24 --> 00:05:24.76 Pusting security, dispatching patrols, seeking a field of fire, retaining their equipment
00:05:24.76 --> 00:05:27.52 and making sure that it is in working order.
00:05:27.52 --> 00:05:31.80 You have to check all the time.
00:05:31.80 --> 00:05:37.80 I believe it was Patton that said 90% of your job as a leader is making sure that the orders
00:05:37.80 --> 00:05:38.80 get executed.
00:05:38.80 --> 00:05:42.60 I'm sure that the things actually get done.
00:05:42.60 --> 00:05:48.32 So that opening right there is what kind of made me just say we need to talk about this.
00:05:48.32 --> 00:05:55.48 Because it's applicable so directly to us as human beings.
00:05:55.48 --> 00:05:57.72 And you know, I was talking about the gravitational pull.
00:05:57.72 --> 00:06:01.48 The gravitational pull, you ever seen the chart of the gravitational pull of when the
00:06:01.48 --> 00:06:03.60 space shuttle or something launches.
00:06:03.60 --> 00:06:05.24 I guess it's not the space shuttle.
00:06:05.24 --> 00:06:06.24 It's space X.
00:06:06.24 --> 00:06:07.24 Sure.
00:06:07.24 --> 00:06:11.04 Elon kicking those things up into space.
00:06:11.04 --> 00:06:12.92 But they use whatever.
00:06:12.92 --> 00:06:18.04 So massive amount of their power is to get the first whatever.
00:06:18.04 --> 00:06:19.04 My a lot.
00:06:19.04 --> 00:06:21.12 That's where they use 50% of their, I don't know what the percentage is.
00:06:21.12 --> 00:06:25.56 But it's a massive percentage of the power is to break free of the gravitational pull of
00:06:25.56 --> 00:06:26.56 the earth.
00:06:26.56 --> 00:06:27.56 They're one set of three of it.
00:06:27.56 --> 00:06:28.56 They're moving there.
00:06:28.56 --> 00:06:29.56 Okay.
00:06:29.56 --> 00:06:34.28 Like so much of the effort of a leader is just to get things to go.
00:06:34.28 --> 00:06:36.12 Get things to move.
00:06:36.12 --> 00:06:37.12 And we're going to get to this.
00:06:37.12 --> 00:06:38.52 There's definitely some things here.
00:06:38.52 --> 00:06:44.56 And we're about to roll into them where it talks about, you know, so much reliance on the
00:06:44.56 --> 00:06:53.68 leadership and in certain situations, you can see them leaning towards a micro management.
00:06:53.68 --> 00:06:55.76 You know, a hay, if I don't make this happen.
00:06:55.76 --> 00:07:00.60 But in all the parts of this book, they start talking about how the way that you're going
00:07:00.60 --> 00:07:03.04 to win is through individual efforts and individual leadership.
00:07:03.04 --> 00:07:05.44 So you get into decentralized command a little bit later.
00:07:05.44 --> 00:07:07.60 But I think it's one of those dichotomies.
00:07:07.60 --> 00:07:08.60 I think it's one of those dichotomies.
00:07:08.60 --> 00:07:14.44 In the matter of fact, I know it's a dichotomy that sometimes the phrase I used to use a
00:07:14.44 --> 00:07:17.36 lot and I used it a lot on this podcast was force of will.
00:07:17.36 --> 00:07:18.36 Right?
00:07:18.36 --> 00:07:20.52 Hey, you know, as a leader, I'm just going to make this happen.
00:07:20.52 --> 00:07:21.52 There is going to be a force of will.
00:07:21.52 --> 00:07:22.52 We are going to win this thing.
00:07:22.52 --> 00:07:23.52 We're going to go.
00:07:23.52 --> 00:07:24.84 I'm going to make this happen.
00:07:24.84 --> 00:07:26.000 And that's what he's talking about here.
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.20 This force of will that you have to exert to make things happen.
00:07:31.20 --> 00:07:34.80 Even things that people know they should do.
00:07:34.80 --> 00:07:37.40 The next section, discipline.
00:07:37.40 --> 00:07:39.64 So right out of the gate, we're talking leadership and discipline.
00:07:39.64 --> 00:07:41.84 I was I was in there.
00:07:41.84 --> 00:07:47.28 The keys to success in combat, the key to success in combat, commanding general in a personal
00:07:47.28 --> 00:07:49.68 letter to Lieutenant General McNair.
00:07:49.68 --> 00:07:54.000 I would like to mention a few things I consider important in getting any prospective units
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.16 ready for duty in Southwest Pacific.
00:07:56.16 --> 00:08:03.04 The first of all requisites is discipline with a capital D.
00:08:03.04 --> 00:08:06.48 I refer to discipline in all its phases.
00:08:06.48 --> 00:08:12.40 Water discipline, malaria discipline, personal appearance, military courtesy, the wearing of
00:08:12.40 --> 00:08:19.12 the uniform, personal and collective sanitation, carrying out orders in general, assumption
00:08:19.12 --> 00:08:24.64 and proper discharge of responsibility throughout the chain of command, etc.
00:08:24.64 --> 00:08:29.96 There's an inclination for men as well as some officers to go native in the tropics to
00:08:29.96 --> 00:08:34.000 let down mentally on material and spiritual values.
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.64 So discipline is especially needed here.
00:08:37.64 --> 00:08:42.04 Need this to say I consider an aggressive offensive spirit always goes hand in hand with
00:08:42.04 --> 00:08:45.80 good discipline.
00:08:45.80 --> 00:08:50.16 So that's one of those things where we're talking about in post discipline.
00:08:50.16 --> 00:08:51.88 In some ways there, right?
00:08:51.88 --> 00:08:53.16 You make sure your weapons are clean.
00:08:53.16 --> 00:08:54.64 Make sure you're cleaning yourselves.
00:08:54.64 --> 00:08:57.44 There's a whole list of things.
00:08:57.44 --> 00:08:58.44 Make sure you're drinking water.
00:08:58.44 --> 00:09:01.04 Make sure you're cleaning your feet.
00:09:01.04 --> 00:09:02.60 Isn't that a weird one?
00:09:02.60 --> 00:09:08.64 Have you ever been in the water in the bush long enough to get like a really bad feet?
00:09:08.64 --> 00:09:09.64 No.
00:09:09.64 --> 00:09:14.60 I got a minor case of trench foot.
00:09:14.60 --> 00:09:20.20 When the guy who is my swim buddy during this particular long S&R operation, where we were
00:09:20.20 --> 00:09:24.64 a two man pair out there, just a training operation, but he got actual trench foot.
00:09:24.64 --> 00:09:28.40 He went to medical and they're like, oh yes, you have trench foot.
00:09:28.40 --> 00:09:32.40 It's weird that things like that.
00:09:32.40 --> 00:09:37.04 When you see talk to your guys about Vietnam, one of the main things that the officers
00:09:37.04 --> 00:09:41.44 would do is check guys feet because they wouldn't check on themselves.
00:09:41.44 --> 00:09:48.48 So even something that seems so obvious, like you'd want to take care of your feet,
00:09:48.48 --> 00:09:51.64 people will not make that little extra effort.
00:09:51.64 --> 00:09:55.32 The inertia for them is to say, you know what I'm just going to go to sleep with my boots
00:09:55.32 --> 00:09:56.32 on their wet.
00:09:56.32 --> 00:09:57.92 I'm not going to drop my feet.
00:09:57.92 --> 00:09:58.92 By the way, you can sleep with your boots on.
00:09:58.92 --> 00:09:59.92 I did.
00:09:59.92 --> 00:10:03.32 We would sleep with our boots on the field, but we take our socks off.
00:10:03.32 --> 00:10:05.28 We'd unlace our boots.
00:10:05.28 --> 00:10:06.60 So our feet are in there just kind of loose.
00:10:06.60 --> 00:10:09.28 They can kind of dry out a little bit.
00:10:09.28 --> 00:10:13.28 Hang your socks on a little tree or something nearby.
00:10:13.28 --> 00:10:14.52 But you don't want to get rolled up.
00:10:14.52 --> 00:10:15.52 Echoes are looking positive.
00:10:15.52 --> 00:10:17.12 You don't want to get rolled up in the field without your boots on.
00:10:17.12 --> 00:10:18.12 Okay.
00:10:18.12 --> 00:10:19.12 That makes sense.
00:10:19.12 --> 00:10:20.12 Figure rolled up in the field without your boots on.
00:10:20.12 --> 00:10:22.12 You got some problems to deal with.
00:10:22.12 --> 00:10:25.20 I can see that BTF Tony, you take one boot off.
00:10:25.20 --> 00:10:26.80 You fix whatever you've got to fix.
00:10:26.80 --> 00:10:29.76 And you put that boot back on, then you don't take both of them off.
00:10:29.76 --> 00:10:31.44 You're just sitting there.
00:10:31.44 --> 00:10:32.92 John McLean style.
00:10:32.92 --> 00:10:33.92 Basically make it.
00:10:33.92 --> 00:10:35.72 Oh yeah, that's a movie.
00:10:35.72 --> 00:10:36.72 Die hard.
00:10:36.72 --> 00:10:37.72 The first one.
00:10:37.72 --> 00:10:38.72 He runs on the glass.
00:10:38.72 --> 00:10:41.12 Yes, he wound up running over glass.
00:10:41.12 --> 00:10:43.20 How come he has to be a call without his boots on?
00:10:43.20 --> 00:10:50.64 Because when he arrived at Nakatomi Plaza, he at a request, not a request, a recommendation
00:10:50.64 --> 00:10:52.12 from a friend.
00:10:52.12 --> 00:10:55.12 Take off your shoes and you make fists in the carpet with your toes.
00:10:55.12 --> 00:10:56.76 It distresses you.
00:10:56.76 --> 00:11:00.44 That's what he was doing in the middle of this hijacking scenario.
00:11:00.44 --> 00:11:01.44 Interesting.
00:11:01.44 --> 00:11:06.16 You know, see, there are what I was thinking that this book had knowledge in it.
00:11:06.16 --> 00:11:17.64 Next, Lieutenant Colonel Clifton F. Con, 77th field artillery, and he lead the great
00:11:17.64 --> 00:11:23.000 stress placed upon discipline and the chain of command is not an overemphasis and never
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.24 can be.
00:11:24.24 --> 00:11:28.000 We have found again and again that the highest standards of discipline are absolutely necessary
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.60 in and out of combat.
00:11:29.60 --> 00:11:34.48 In no other way, can you be assured that the individual soldier will carry out orders without
00:11:34.48 --> 00:11:39.76 supervision and in combat this is essential.
00:11:39.76 --> 00:11:44.08 Again, we're talking about very stringent discipline.
00:11:44.08 --> 00:11:46.04 We're talking about imposed discipline.
00:11:46.04 --> 00:11:48.04 I mean, we are.
00:11:48.04 --> 00:11:49.48 It's called it like it is.
00:11:49.48 --> 00:11:52.88 Yeah, but the connection he's making is, is why I was thinking as you're talking
00:11:52.88 --> 00:11:56.28 out last passage, it's that connection to the imposed discipline that I'm going to start
00:11:56.28 --> 00:11:57.28 with.
00:11:57.28 --> 00:12:00.20 That's going to get you to recognize over time.
00:12:00.20 --> 00:12:03.12 What you need to do the self-discipline you need to create.
00:12:03.12 --> 00:12:06.32 And if your plan is like, I'm just going to make my folks self-discipline, you're
00:12:06.32 --> 00:12:08.84 actually going to skip the part where they learn why you have to do it.
00:12:08.84 --> 00:12:11.84 And sometimes that starts with, you're going to do this.
00:12:11.84 --> 00:12:13.84 You could explain it.
00:12:13.84 --> 00:12:17.88 But you asked me if I ever had immersion footer trench, but I never spent enough time in
00:12:17.88 --> 00:12:19.36 environment to have to deal with that.
00:12:19.36 --> 00:12:24.36 But I'll tell you my very first for smart, for smart, which is a five mile for smart,
00:12:24.36 --> 00:12:28.40 like a very short for smart and also candid school in 1991.
00:12:28.40 --> 00:12:29.76 We stopped 50 minutes into it.
00:12:29.76 --> 00:12:30.76 We all changed our socks.
00:12:30.76 --> 00:12:32.36 That's what we did.
00:12:32.36 --> 00:12:37.44 And so that's one example of, but it was totally imposed on us, but I was able to make
00:12:37.44 --> 00:12:40.44 that connection from these other people.
00:12:40.44 --> 00:12:44.80 And so you're telling the story about people that were non-combat ready because of that.
00:12:44.80 --> 00:12:47.48 But those lessons are all over the place in the military.
00:12:47.48 --> 00:12:51.16 And it's all search the same way, which is sit down, take your boots off, change your
00:12:51.16 --> 00:12:52.16 socks.
00:12:52.16 --> 00:12:56.16 And then over time you make the connection of, oh, I understand what I need to do this.
00:12:56.16 --> 00:13:00.64 So no, I never had it, but I was taught that lesson very early on.
00:13:00.64 --> 00:13:07.28 Yeah, there's some sort of, you know, obvious religious overtones too of, right, of
00:13:07.28 --> 00:13:10.04 like taking care of your men's feet, right?
00:13:10.04 --> 00:13:14.04 That's just a powerful thing.
00:13:14.04 --> 00:13:15.80 Next, the basis of good discipline.
00:13:15.80 --> 00:13:21.16 One of our problems has been to get junior officers and young NTO sufficiently hard-boiled
00:13:21.16 --> 00:13:27.08 to exact from their subordinates and meticulous obedience to every order.
00:13:27.08 --> 00:13:32.12 We must ingrain in all ranks the realization that orders are not to be treated as suggestions,
00:13:32.12 --> 00:13:38.92 but as concrete facts calling for the utmost effort until they have been carried out.
00:13:38.92 --> 00:13:44.48 So many people seem to feel that orders which are inconvenient or unpopular are to be
00:13:44.48 --> 00:13:45.48 disregarded.
00:13:45.48 --> 00:13:47.48 And this is one of those things.
00:13:47.48 --> 00:13:51.28 Hard for me to read this because we're always telling people, look, the military is not
00:13:51.28 --> 00:13:52.28 this thing.
00:13:52.28 --> 00:13:57.72 We're just someone barks orders of you and everyone just obeys, which it's not.
00:13:57.72 --> 00:14:01.32 This state of mind is a disease and must be eliminated.
00:14:01.32 --> 00:14:06.40 So what this section says or what this individual is saying, and I don't know if this is
00:14:06.40 --> 00:14:09.92 the same guy talking because it's not broken out.
00:14:09.92 --> 00:14:13.28 But then it says this, then it says this.
00:14:13.28 --> 00:14:20.20 On the other hand, so we got dichotomy and elimination, presupposes that all commanding
00:14:20.20 --> 00:14:26.08 officers and staffs take care that the orders they issue are consistent, correct, and
00:14:26.08 --> 00:14:28.28 capable of being carried out.
00:14:28.28 --> 00:14:36.56 So that's a very discrete way of saying, if you give me an order, that's not consistent,
00:14:36.56 --> 00:14:40.92 not correct and not capable of being carried out, I'm not going to follow it.
00:14:40.92 --> 00:14:42.16 That's what that says.
00:14:42.16 --> 00:14:44.32 They do it in a very roundabout way.
00:14:44.32 --> 00:14:47.84 They're very cautious about how they said that because they know they had Colonel Pog and
00:14:47.84 --> 00:14:49.32 the room there or right this.
00:14:49.32 --> 00:14:53.68 And Colonel Pog said, these bad need to listen.
00:14:53.68 --> 00:14:58.88 Because Colonel Pog comes up with the best plan every time.
00:14:58.88 --> 00:14:59.88 Master your job.
00:14:59.88 --> 00:15:05.76 Lieutenant General Walter Kruger, discipline and the leadership of small units are the things
00:15:05.76 --> 00:15:08.40 which require constant emphasis.
00:15:08.40 --> 00:15:12.40 The enlisted man or officer who does not follow instructions and orders implicitly during
00:15:12.40 --> 00:15:19.000 training or prior to reaching combat areas and who cannot do everything every member of
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.84 his unit might have to do is not properly qualified.
00:15:21.84 --> 00:15:25.40 The squad leader must know exactly what each member of his squad should do in each type
00:15:25.40 --> 00:15:26.40 of operation.
00:15:26.40 --> 00:15:30.16 The platoon leaders should have the same knowledge concerning his squad's and the company
00:15:30.16 --> 00:15:31.92 commander of his platoon.
00:15:31.92 --> 00:15:37.52 Officers must not start worrying about the big picture until they have mastered all the details
00:15:37.52 --> 00:15:39.52 of the little one.
00:15:39.52 --> 00:15:41.08 It's an interesting one.
00:15:41.08 --> 00:15:47.40 I can tell you right now that it would be impossible to know everything that this sniper
00:15:47.40 --> 00:15:50.52 knows it would be possible to know everything that the radio man knows it would be impossible
00:15:50.52 --> 00:15:53.32 to know everything that the point man knows it would be impossible to know everything
00:15:53.32 --> 00:15:55.64 that the breach or knows.
00:15:55.64 --> 00:15:57.12 Do you need to understand them?
00:15:57.12 --> 00:15:58.12 Yes.
00:15:58.12 --> 00:16:02.44 Should you be able to set up that breaching charge and clock it off if you have to absolutely
00:16:02.44 --> 00:16:07.12 should you be able to pick up that radio and make comms if you have to where I take my
00:16:07.12 --> 00:16:08.12 take the communicate.
00:16:08.12 --> 00:16:10.56 It may take the radio man for seconds to do it.
00:16:10.56 --> 00:16:12.72 It might take you three minutes.
00:16:12.72 --> 00:16:14.12 Should you be able to not do it?
00:16:14.12 --> 00:16:17.52 Yes.
00:16:17.52 --> 00:16:23.96 At some point if you're worrying about the details of the little picture, you might be doing
00:16:23.96 --> 00:16:28.40 a disservice by thinking too much about the little picture and not enough about the big
00:16:28.40 --> 00:16:29.40 picture.
00:16:29.40 --> 00:16:36.52 So I think officers should start thinking about the big picture from day one and understanding
00:16:36.52 --> 00:16:37.52 how things fit together.
00:16:37.52 --> 00:16:42.60 Now you can't get lost in that but you got to start thinking about it early.
00:16:42.60 --> 00:16:45.52 Otherwise your habit is just worrying about the little things.
00:16:45.52 --> 00:16:50.64 Your focus becomes looking down and in and set up an out.
00:16:50.64 --> 00:16:52.28 So little.
00:16:52.28 --> 00:16:54.84 That one's too strong for me.
00:16:54.84 --> 00:16:55.84 Too strong for me.
00:16:55.84 --> 00:16:58.60 And I talked about that in leadership strategy and tactics.
00:16:58.60 --> 00:17:01.64 You got to know what to do but.
00:17:01.64 --> 00:17:08.12 There's like a very discreet place in the military where you go from being tactical.
00:17:08.12 --> 00:17:11.84 They call it operation but where you start being a strategic in the Marine Corps it's
00:17:11.84 --> 00:17:15.52 got being a company great officer which is like a junior officer for brand new lieutenant
00:17:15.52 --> 00:17:17.40 to a field great officer.
00:17:17.40 --> 00:17:21.76 And all of a sudden there's this magical moment that when you get promoted from in the
00:17:21.76 --> 00:17:24.66 Marine Corps it's captain to major and a fits in the Navy from Lieutenant to Lieutenant
00:17:24.66 --> 00:17:25.66 Commander.
00:17:25.66 --> 00:17:28.40 Well all of a sudden overnight you are now a field great officer and you're supposed to
00:17:28.40 --> 00:17:29.84 think strategically.
00:17:29.84 --> 00:17:33.76 In this transition point actually is a big source of friction for a lot of folks and the
00:17:33.76 --> 00:17:37.84 people that struggle the most going from company to field great are the ones who have never
00:17:37.84 --> 00:17:40.000 thought about the big picture before.
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.84 And it's not to say that as a second lieutenant that I've been in the Marine Corps for six
00:17:42.84 --> 00:17:47.16 months I need to walk into the CO's office and start talking strategy.
00:17:47.16 --> 00:17:50.84 But you have to start thinking very early on about the impacts of what you do to the big
00:17:50.84 --> 00:17:54.84 picture and assume you can make the connection the easier that transition is.
00:17:54.84 --> 00:17:59.20 And the longer you hold on it because it's just kind of like this cool bravado of like
00:17:59.20 --> 00:18:03.32 I'm a tactician and it sounds really cool and I just want to fly the airplane and I don't
00:18:03.32 --> 00:18:04.92 only care about the big picture.
00:18:04.92 --> 00:18:09.64 Well when the time comes you get promoted and you probably will it was really clear
00:18:09.64 --> 00:18:12.72 the ones who never really thought about what they were doing and how that fit into the
00:18:12.72 --> 00:18:18.04 larger world when you made that promotion that obviously actually became highly incompetent
00:18:18.04 --> 00:18:21.16 at being a field great officer because that's when you were starting and you were being
00:18:21.16 --> 00:18:25.04 out maneuvered by guys who had been doing it since they were brand new officers.
00:18:25.04 --> 00:18:30.88 You know what's really interesting about that is there are some people that have a
00:18:30.88 --> 00:18:37.96 personality and or skill set that is more suited to be a tactical officer and there's
00:18:37.96 --> 00:18:43.36 some people that have a personality and skill set that is more suited to be a field
00:18:43.36 --> 00:18:48.32 great officer or a strategic thinker that's and I see this in companies too.
00:18:48.32 --> 00:18:56.40 I work with companies where the CEO that got that company from whatever position you know
00:18:56.40 --> 00:19:02.64 got them to go public or got them perched or poised to go public as soon as they're
00:19:02.64 --> 00:19:06.16 going public that guy's out there or maybe even before they go public because this guy
00:19:06.16 --> 00:19:10.48 he's good at making the exact dynamic but he's not polished he's not clean he can't
00:19:10.48 --> 00:19:15.12 brief up the chain of command well he doesn't articulate himself at the next level because
00:19:15.12 --> 00:19:21.20 some people can flow from talking to a platoon like the snowpapers was going on like you're
00:19:21.20 --> 00:19:25.68 you can be in that mode and you can walk turnaround and talk to give the general a brief on
00:19:25.68 --> 00:19:30.48 what the impact on the cultural moment or the civilian populist and all those things.
00:19:31.76 --> 00:19:37.76 Some people can do both some people do one some people do the other and it's very interesting.
00:19:37.76 --> 00:19:44.96 It's very interesting because you might not make it to field great officer even though
00:19:44.96 --> 00:19:52.16 you might be you might be good at it but you just don't have the you just don't have it.
00:19:53.52 --> 00:19:58.24 So think about that when you're working with you know when you got people
00:19:58.24 --> 00:20:02.40 subordinates that you're working with you might have somebody that's not maybe the best
00:20:02.40 --> 00:20:03.36 tactical leader.
00:20:05.52 --> 00:20:10.64 Are they can they do the job? You know what I mean look they might not be able to do they might not be
00:20:10.64 --> 00:20:17.20 the best at it but maybe they can get through that job and they can do a good job as the
00:20:17.20 --> 00:20:25.28 at the next level up and some people they might be incredible that get after it in the field
00:20:25.92 --> 00:20:33.52 and you can't let them brief the boss because they're going to mess it up. So the good thing is
00:20:34.32 --> 00:20:38.32 if you're if you're one of these humans out there if you're one of these potential leaders
00:20:38.32 --> 00:20:45.68 think about where you are and think about modulating your personality depending I can promise you
00:20:46.40 --> 00:20:55.20 if you watched me debrief a seal platoon and then you watched me brief the secretary of the navy
00:20:55.76 --> 00:21:00.88 those two guys like the venn diagram overlap was pretty small.
00:21:01.60 --> 00:21:06.24 If you were just to take the words that I said just a man you scrapped or whatever trianscript of what I said
00:21:06.24 --> 00:21:12.64 the core things that I said the I wasn't saying anything different I wasn't saying I wasn't
00:21:12.64 --> 00:21:18.72 giving I wasn't lying to the big boss and I wasn't lying to the troops but the the method of
00:21:18.72 --> 00:21:23.92 delivery was different because I was talking to a different audience who understands things differently.
00:21:26.88 --> 00:21:34.000 Good thing to think about you. A couple of these here trial by fire
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:44.40 there's there's incredible stories inside these books about what men do and they're definitely
00:21:44.40 --> 00:21:48.24 worth look this is another one from we read one from this last time this is from the
00:21:49.12 --> 00:21:55.04 the battle of the at two island which is those allusion islands up in Alaska fight in the Japanese
00:21:56.88 --> 00:22:03.68 this is a citation. The company led by Captain Thomas Biodonol was thrown into confusion by
00:22:03.68 --> 00:22:08.64 the strafing of hostile airplanes while it was forming to attack under heavy enemy ground small
00:22:08.64 --> 00:22:13.76 arms fire seeing the immediate need captain O'Donnell move from his squad from squad to squad
00:22:13.76 --> 00:22:18.64 restoring order and then led his men to the assault during which he received a severe wound in the
00:22:18.64 --> 00:22:22.88 neck and shoulder and was evacuated three days later upon hearing that his company was again
00:22:22.88 --> 00:22:27.28 scheduled to make an attack he insisted upon returning to the fight although we can suffer
00:22:27.28 --> 00:22:32.80 severe pain from his wounds he led his company in attacks on the enemy until five days later when
00:22:32.80 --> 00:22:37.28 he was mortally wounded while moving about into advanced positions encouraging his men
00:22:42.96 --> 00:22:48.96 one of the one of the one of the lessons that I taught specifically I taught it's a little
00:22:48.96 --> 00:22:53.76 bunch of people but the first time I remember teaching if someone was to was to Seth Stone
00:22:53.76 --> 00:22:57.28 the Delta Patoon commander who you know when you're doing immediate action drills
00:22:57.28 --> 00:23:02.96 there's there's standard operating procedures and you follow you follow the standard operating
00:23:02.96 --> 00:23:09.52 procedures and he would you know he would follow what the rules were and that if that meant
00:23:09.52 --> 00:23:15.12 that he was gonna his next position that he was supposed to go to according to the standard
00:23:15.12 --> 00:23:18.40 operating procedures was behind a berm where he couldn't see anything that's where he was going
00:23:19.44 --> 00:23:23.84 and you know I just said hey man why are you going there you know uh because this is where
00:23:23.84 --> 00:23:29.52 we're supposed to go I said can you see anything no can you make a call no can you can you
00:23:29.52 --> 00:23:35.12 lead your men no okay move move around go see what you got to see you can move around you
00:23:35.12 --> 00:23:41.20 you don't you don't you can't break the SOPs there's a difference right you can't break the SOPs
00:23:41.20 --> 00:23:46.000 but you don't have to follow them perfectly so there's a big difference breaking the SOPs
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.40 means you get out of your lane and now you can get shot by friendly fire not following the SOPs
00:23:50.40 --> 00:23:54.48 means you're staying within the confines of the rules but you're still moving around and telling
00:23:54.48 --> 00:23:58.80 people what to do and you can imagine this is a perfect example of what this whole thing started
00:23:58.80 --> 00:24:04.40 off with which is look this guy in order to get his troops to go he had to personally get out
00:24:04.40 --> 00:24:10.08 there and and you know why would you risk your life to him to in that's what it says encourages
00:24:10.08 --> 00:24:13.84 men why would you risk your life to encourage your men you know why because if you don't do that
00:24:13.84 --> 00:24:17.12 your men are going anywhere that's the breaking the inertia you talk about at the beginning
00:24:17.12 --> 00:24:20.48 exactly you don't do that as a leader you're going to sit there anger you're going to you're going to
00:24:20.48 --> 00:24:23.44 eventually you're going to get rolled you're all going to die in that position you cannot stay there
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.60 but the path of the least resistance that human nature is I like this box hole yeah
00:24:27.60 --> 00:24:31.76 it's going to hang out down here this is good for me and he's like no we can't stay here
00:24:32.56 --> 00:24:35.28 and leadership is the only thing that gets people to see that
00:24:37.52 --> 00:24:40.08 that that is that those are the times when you have to lead from the front
00:24:40.48 --> 00:24:41.60 you got to make things happen
00:24:43.28 --> 00:24:47.04 doubling in brass and I have no idea I don't know if there's some weird
00:24:47.04 --> 00:24:53.60 1940s idiom that I don't know about but this title is sections doubling in brass
00:24:54.88 --> 00:25:01.84 citation 37th division new Georgia while private Blair F. hurts was performing his duties
00:25:01.84 --> 00:25:06.24 with the maintenance section in the vicinity of the unit ration dump they were attacked by
00:25:06.24 --> 00:25:11.60 japs who had surrounded them he grabbed a bar and advanced on a jap machine gun that was
00:25:11.60 --> 00:25:16.48 delivering intense accurate and extremely effective fire into the dump private hurts
00:25:16.48 --> 00:25:20.000 was able to silence this machine gun and then continue to aid aggressively in the defense
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.44 of the position until reinforcements arrived just getting after it just in the rear
00:25:25.44 --> 00:25:30.40 getting after it when the citation starts with the private you know you know this is going to be
00:25:30.40 --> 00:25:36.64 a good one you know he got some yeah you know what's too bad is you know in the navy you have
00:25:36.64 --> 00:25:40.64 rates where you can tell what the guy's job was or this guy's just a private but you know his
00:25:40.64 --> 00:25:46.24 job was probably you know well he says mate his duties with the maintenance section so this guy was
00:25:46.24 --> 00:25:51.52 changing oils and vehicles or something and then all of a sudden he's grabbing a bar and just
00:25:51.52 --> 00:25:58.80 getting some here we go dichotomy of leadership oh no sorry this section we call that it's
00:25:58.80 --> 00:26:06.80 called something else called be brave intelligently this is a weird one to read lieutenant Colonel
00:26:06.80 --> 00:26:12.96 Ariel Bryan cavalry observer with the fifth army and Italy a prisoner of war a German light
00:26:12.96 --> 00:26:19.12 machine gunner asked an interrogator whether Americans took stimulants to make them foolishly brave
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.28 when asked to explain what he meant he stated that he and an assistant gunner were in position
00:26:25.28 --> 00:26:30.88 with a good field of fire one afternoon when a group of American soldiers was observed approaching
00:26:31.52 --> 00:26:38.08 he fired several short bursts and began preparation to displace to the rear when he saw the
00:26:38.08 --> 00:26:44.24 American soldiers rise to full height and start charging toward his position over a hundred yards away
00:26:45.12 --> 00:26:51.68 he reloaded his gun and opened fire killing 11 men he then withdrew because he was sure the
00:26:51.68 --> 00:26:59.12 charge was made to conceal an development but none was made unit commander has found it necessary
00:26:59.12 --> 00:27:04.64 to direct their men to make full use of concealment and covered approach continued emphasis on the
00:27:04.64 --> 00:27:10.48 necessity for dispersion and the use of covering concealment is essential so this is what we
00:27:10.48 --> 00:27:15.52 don't want to have happen we don't want people to be so brave that you charge over an open area
00:27:15.52 --> 00:27:23.60 a machine gun nest and the comment here says in the interest of efficiency bravery must be
00:27:23.60 --> 00:27:30.56 supplemented by brain work dead heroes are of little further used to their units aggressive
00:27:30.56 --> 00:27:35.44 fighting men trained to apply the most efficient technique to combat problems willing to accept
00:27:35.44 --> 00:27:41.76 any necessary risks and conscientiously avoiding unnecessary risks are the backbone of the army
00:27:45.68 --> 00:27:50.88 got to be brave but you got to be smart there's the dichotomy who's the original
00:27:50.88 --> 00:27:54.72 original statement on that was brave but not full hearting brave but not full hearted
00:27:54.72 --> 00:28:03.04 combat in towns as major campaigns develop in western europe combat in towns assumes increasing
00:28:03.04 --> 00:28:07.60 importance cities towns and villages control the established road nets which must be open for the
00:28:07.60 --> 00:28:12.32 movement of guns heavy equipment it supplies necessary to support the advance of infantry
00:28:12.88 --> 00:28:19.20 combat in towns will often be the key not only to our successful advance but to successful defensive
00:28:19.20 --> 00:28:29.92 actions let's talk about now in 1944 attack of towns captain w heherson heherson parachute
00:28:29.92 --> 00:28:35.04 retreat Italy the theory of attack of a small town or villages to work groups around the
00:28:35.04 --> 00:28:40.24 flanks cut the retreat and moving with patrols in this hilly country however we have found that
00:28:40.24 --> 00:28:45.28 where there is any high ground behind the town which dominates both the town and the line of
00:28:45.28 --> 00:28:51.44 retreat the best way is to work the entire force around the town undercover sees the high ground
00:28:51.44 --> 00:28:56.72 in the rear and firmly establish ourselves with 60 millimeter mortars on that dominating high ground
00:28:56.72 --> 00:29:01.28 we take enough food and ammunition for to last us 24 hours and the Germans usually pull out during
00:29:01.28 --> 00:29:06.40 this time from our position we can prevent reinforcement and inflict heavy losses on them during
00:29:06.40 --> 00:29:09.76 there withdrawal so we're flanking people and we're taking high ground
00:29:09.76 --> 00:29:20.000 I didn't think of anything new I didn't think of anything new
00:29:22.64 --> 00:29:27.44 Lieutenant Colonel LG Freeman parachute infantry battalion commander in Italy
00:29:28.08 --> 00:29:36.32 we learned at Altavia to avoid the direct attack of towns it's too costly we now work around
00:29:36.32 --> 00:29:41.20 to the rear with a large force and seize the dominating ground in the rear we did this at Calo
00:29:41.20 --> 00:29:47.44 Machia for Nellie and several other places the names of which I forgot I like when you're just
00:29:47.44 --> 00:29:52.32 forgetting major battles that you've had to work every time get yourself within 60 millimeter
00:29:52.32 --> 00:29:57.60 mortar range of the town on dominating terrain in or near it and the Germans won't stay in it
00:29:58.96 --> 00:30:04.24 and then it says this here's the comment I like these comments the fact that the Germans have been
00:30:04.24 --> 00:30:09.68 known to withdraw without a fight from towns in the rear of which we hold dominating terrain
00:30:09.68 --> 00:30:16.000 does not necessarily mean that such will invariably be the rule however this possibility plus the
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.68 fact the Caesar such high ground will greatly facilitate any subsequent attack on the town
00:30:21.68 --> 00:30:26.88 proper suggest that commanders should give serious consideration of these tactics where the terrain
00:30:26.88 --> 00:30:31.52 permits it also should be remembered that if such high ground is held by the enemy or attack
00:30:31.52 --> 00:30:38.000 on the town proper will invariably be costly and the town itself untenable that's how important
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.96 high ground is. In planning the attack of the town proper the following considerations should
00:30:44.96 --> 00:30:53.76 be born in mind one reduced observation and limited fields of fire in place of heavier stress on
00:30:53.76 --> 00:31:00.000 close combat so you are going to get some to controlling of attacking troops will be difficult
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.76 and much depends on individual initiative and aggressiveness of small unit leaders so there you
00:31:07.76 --> 00:31:14.72 are we we we we open up talking about how you better follow all these orders and now we're on page eight
00:31:15.44 --> 00:31:22.24 and we're talking about hey you know what it depends on the initiative of initiative and aggressiveness
00:31:22.24 --> 00:31:29.44 of small unit leaders making things happen where possible town should be bypassed isolated
00:31:29.44 --> 00:31:34.32 and attacked from the flanks or the rear why are we even attacking this position if we don't have to
00:31:34.96 --> 00:31:39.60 roll around it imagine if you made that part of your everyday sort of scheme maneuver
00:31:40.48 --> 00:31:44.40 I can beat my head against this wall or I can walk around it it seems like a good idea
00:31:51.28 --> 00:31:54.48 at least it seems like a good idea to me I don't know echoes over their shaking I said like
00:31:54.48 --> 00:31:59.68 I know a lot of times when you say every you know you use those what he call those words that are
00:31:59.68 --> 00:32:06.000 real like real permanent yeah like and do that in every thing you know every time you say that I think
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.08 it's triggered I do I took some I took some heat off of by saying it seems like yeah that would be a
00:32:12.08 --> 00:32:18.80 good thing to do in part of your everyday plan yeah then that's what kind of triggered me so to think like
00:32:18.80 --> 00:32:24.96 of all the things that it probably or maybe wouldn't work yeah I don't know would you treat your
00:32:24.96 --> 00:32:30.96 workouts like that let me sidestep this workout maybe flank it you're on dangerous ground right now
00:32:34.72 --> 00:32:39.76 yes there's going to you're potentially right about that I'm just saying usually when it
00:32:39.76 --> 00:32:43.36 comes to work out I'm going to smash the workout it's based it you know I'm going to go ahead
00:32:43.36 --> 00:32:48.64 on full frontal assault yes sir well I thought would think so anyway unless that make us it depends on
00:32:48.64 --> 00:32:54.48 what you mean by flank like I guess you could flank your initial feelings about the income and
00:32:54.48 --> 00:33:00.16 workout if you don't feel like doing it you know you could maybe maneuver that way maybe but
00:33:00.72 --> 00:33:06.16 maybe maybe not I don't know maybe just direct assault workout smash it get it done I like it
00:33:06.16 --> 00:33:12.16 there are times there are times so maybe not everything in life you know maybe not everything
00:33:12.16 --> 00:33:17.04 yeah but maybe if you're dealing with other people it's a good call yeah that could be the case
00:33:19.04 --> 00:33:24.40 this section here start talking about like how you actually clear towns it goes through
00:33:24.96 --> 00:33:29.44 and then it gets to a point where it starts just telling the comments about the story so I'm not
00:33:29.44 --> 00:33:33.28 going to dump into the story you're not going to go deep into the story here but just some of the
00:33:33.28 --> 00:33:37.76 comments here about the defense of a town the defense of a town must be prepared to meet the
00:33:37.76 --> 00:33:42.32 methods of attack which may be employed by the enemy since this must include the possibility of
00:33:42.32 --> 00:33:48.32 flanking attacks and encirclement it follows that an all-around defense must be the rule the following
00:33:48.32 --> 00:33:52.08 points not covered in the experience quoted above which is the one that I didn't read which
00:33:52.08 --> 00:33:56.40 why you should read these things yourself should be born in mind in planning the defense of a town
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.96 one avoid if possible placing principal centers of resistance close to landmarks or at the edge of
00:34:04.96 --> 00:34:10.80 a town where the enemy adjustment of artillery or mortar fire will be facilitated positions either
00:34:10.80 --> 00:34:19.20 outside or within the town should be chosen and I read this whole section to read this and it's
00:34:19.20 --> 00:34:22.64 something that we talked about the other day on EF online and I don't know if you were if you
00:34:22.64 --> 00:34:26.88 were we on the call and I talked about don't give away your position yes yeah totally I went into a whole
00:34:26.88 --> 00:34:35.84 whole explanation of not giving away your position and it's weird it's weird thing to talk about
00:34:35.84 --> 00:34:42.48 because it seems real sneaky right it seems real like oh it seems real sneaky especially when people
00:34:42.48 --> 00:34:50.000 love so much to talk about like being transparent but here's the deal if you have an idea Dave
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:58.40 and I have my own idea if I just put my stake in the ground and say my idea is this I'm giving away
00:34:58.40 --> 00:35:04.56 my position now if we were going to go a tack of an enemy outpost I would do everything I possibly
00:35:04.56 --> 00:35:09.44 could to avoid giving away my position because once I give away my position it will now you know
00:35:09.44 --> 00:35:17.20 to where to attack me on so what I would rather do is listen to what you have to say here let let me
00:35:17.20 --> 00:35:24.56 understand what your position is because then it allows me to maneuver and change my position
00:35:25.20 --> 00:35:31.60 and also if you're on offensive person and your ego is out of control as soon as you see my
00:35:31.60 --> 00:35:35.28 position guess what you're going to do attack it so I gave you my position now you're going to
00:35:35.28 --> 00:35:41.12 attack it now what do I do then dig in now what do we have a standoff we have extra casualties we
00:35:41.12 --> 00:35:47.76 don't need so why am I giving away my position when I'm having a conversation and this is it's one
00:35:47.76 --> 00:35:55.60 of those things it sounds so manipulative right but then I took a little bit further on the F online
00:35:55.60 --> 00:36:03.36 I said this is the facts the reason I don't give away my position is because I don't actually have
00:36:03.36 --> 00:36:11.52 one I'm not rolling in there thinking that I know everything I'm thinking I may have some ideas that
00:36:11.52 --> 00:36:16.56 could you might be able to calculate an estimate approximate where I am but I'm not going to go in
00:36:16.56 --> 00:36:23.60 there and say Dave I believe this because not not just because I want to hide it from you that's not why
00:36:24.80 --> 00:36:32.32 it's because I actually question my own beliefs I actually am not looking at you thinking I know the
00:36:32.32 --> 00:36:38.24 best thing to do I've got some ideas but you can't lock down my position because I'm not going to
00:36:38.24 --> 00:36:46.08 stay there I'm not digging in being transparent this authenticity doesn't have to be in
00:36:46.08 --> 00:36:52.48 opposition to what we just described either being transparent could be hey I'm going to I'm going to
00:36:52.48 --> 00:36:56.56 have a conversation to tell you a whole bunch of things that I'm thinking about that are things
00:36:56.56 --> 00:37:00.64 for you to consider as well for me maybe thinking what I don't want to do is sit here and go
00:37:00.64 --> 00:37:04.56 hey you've mentioned three things that are really feel like I want to give you feedback on but I don't
00:37:04.56 --> 00:37:10.16 want to tell you those things for whatever reason being transparent is not the same is digging your
00:37:10.16 --> 00:37:17.04 heels in those the authenticity of that there's this you would know this echo there's this social
00:37:17.04 --> 00:37:22.16 media thing we're like somebody says some statement it's like a meme and then it says prove me wrong
00:37:22.16 --> 00:37:28.32 it'll say like Martians colonized the moon proved me wrong or louder with crowd or situation
00:37:28.32 --> 00:37:33.68 whatever I don't I I should know more about it no you probably know enough but there's this little
00:37:33.68 --> 00:37:38.80 you know what kind of underneath that is this idea like you're not going to change my mind
00:37:39.36 --> 00:37:43.92 I know that you're not going to change my mind I'm being fully transparent here this idea of
00:37:43.92 --> 00:37:50.32 transparency doesn't have to be the opposite of what you just described you can be fully transparent
00:37:50.32 --> 00:37:53.36 and if I actually my relationship is strong enough with you you know what you're going to do when
00:37:53.36 --> 00:37:56.72 I'm being transparent you're going to listen to me and then you're going to come back with some
00:37:56.72 --> 00:38:00.64 things that's a good point and then actually together what will happen is we'll come up with the
00:38:00.64 --> 00:38:04.56 right plan and then we'll go execute it and it'll be awesome yeah the idea of not giving away
00:38:04.56 --> 00:38:08.64 your position you don't give it away not because you did not because you're hiding it it's because
00:38:08.64 --> 00:38:13.52 you're truly don't know you don't lock yourself into it so I'm not walking in the conversations
00:38:13.52 --> 00:38:20.08 I know what to do not doing that and if you if you're in a leadership role if you're in an actual
00:38:20.08 --> 00:38:24.96 leadership role how much do you think your people really want to engage with you if you
00:38:24.96 --> 00:38:30.40 announce your position out of the gate what's the chances of them giving you great feedback
00:38:30.40 --> 00:38:36.16 you can transparent yeah yeah how does that encourage transparency from the troops answer
00:38:36.16 --> 00:38:40.08 it doesn't well and if it does hey Dave that sounds a great idea I fully support your idea
00:38:40.08 --> 00:38:44.56 you're so smart yeah which is the last thing you want is a leader to be told how smart you are
00:38:44.56 --> 00:38:49.04 by your support it's you want to be told hey I don't agree with you a great tell me why
00:38:49.04 --> 00:39:00.08 where practical forms salience by organizing outlying buildings to cover perimeter
00:39:01.04 --> 00:39:07.52 of town with flanking and an unfulfilled fire I had to look up the word salience
00:39:07.52 --> 00:39:12.000 I said I didn't know what it meant it's like a little projection that's sticking out
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.04 of the battle line so you in order to get a little better cover you can you can take an outline
00:39:17.04 --> 00:39:24.000 building and you can set up a kind of a a fort there good now a salient yeah form salience
00:39:25.28 --> 00:39:29.76 because there's a word salient right yeah it means like significant or what does that mean
00:39:29.76 --> 00:39:35.36 I think it's like a clear point yeah which is the the other it's the same thing right a clear point
00:39:35.36 --> 00:39:39.36 well here I am making this it's a couple of projections a point something sticks out
00:39:39.36 --> 00:39:44.40 that was a salient point yeah meaning oh yeah I rose a good point I understand what you said
00:39:44.40 --> 00:39:50.32 oh we built a salient out there what's a little point where we've got the solid coverage
00:39:51.44 --> 00:39:57.20 kind of like monolithic kind of same deal yeah I guess kind of kind of the same deal like
00:39:57.20 --> 00:40:02.72 there's a monolith which is the noun version of monolithic kind of kind of thing
00:40:04.40 --> 00:40:08.80 yes there are all kinds of words that are based on other words hey I'm just trying to understand
00:40:08.80 --> 00:40:14.72 real deal yeah everyone's while echo says something and then once he says he writes down a little
00:40:14.72 --> 00:40:19.20 note and that means he's gonna go back and edit himself out I don't know if that made the list I think
00:40:19.20 --> 00:40:23.60 he's gonna hold it I think he's going strong no hey made that it'll probably help some people
00:40:23.60 --> 00:40:30.000 as far as salient and salient goes yeah and and also help people realize that there are multiple
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:39.68 versions of the same words in the world yes it's sure oh my jerk that too is sure in addition to a
00:40:39.68 --> 00:40:45.28 central reserve within the town provide if possible for a concealed mobile reserve preferably
00:40:45.28 --> 00:40:51.36 strong and armor to be held outside the town to counter enemy flanking maneuver and once again what
00:40:51.36 --> 00:40:56.56 is the root of that right there don't give away your position the root of it is hey hide this element
00:40:56.56 --> 00:41:04.72 which is smart keep it mobile wherever adjacent terrain features dominate the town they should
00:41:04.72 --> 00:41:11.44 be secured obviously this use of high ground maybe key to successful defense that's funny they
00:41:11.44 --> 00:41:16.56 they say dominant terrain and then they just call it high ground within the town the construction
00:41:16.56 --> 00:41:20.56 of street obstacles or barricades to impede enemy movements and the organization of groups
00:41:20.56 --> 00:41:26.88 of buildings into strong points should be carried out as extensively as time available will permit
00:41:28.16 --> 00:41:32.48 strength in your defenses in delaying actions the defensive use of towns will prevent the
00:41:32.48 --> 00:41:37.60 attacker from determining the strength of the opposing of the forces opposing him it is not
00:41:37.60 --> 00:41:43.76 normally advisable to organize a town as an isolated strong point except under terrain conditions
00:41:43.76 --> 00:41:49.12 which prevent the enemy bypassing it so don't stick a town out there on its own don't stick
00:41:49.12 --> 00:42:00.88 anyone out there on their own unless the terrain allows it so then there's a um i didn't cover one of
00:42:00.88 --> 00:42:06.56 these one of these sections but this one when i started reading it and as i read through it i
00:42:06.56 --> 00:42:14.64 said myself this is such a great example of simplicity and the way this this battalion attack
00:42:14.64 --> 00:42:19.04 happens and then the way it gets debriefed is all very interesting so i'm going to burn through this real
00:42:19.04 --> 00:42:25.04 quick mission is a battalion attack in Italy mission lieutenant colonel Earl Taylor infantry battalion
00:42:25.04 --> 00:42:30.80 commander in Italy on october on eleven october my battalion was ordered to make a night march
00:42:30.80 --> 00:42:36.40 passed through the second battalion which was about three miles east of the Italian town of Guadilla
00:42:37.12 --> 00:42:43.44 north of the color river and seize the high ground in the vicinity of Guadilla we were then
00:42:43.44 --> 00:42:50.64 to continue the advance contact as we approach Guadilla our leading company made contact with the
00:42:50.64 --> 00:42:55.76 enemy at a and there's a sketch that they go through this it developed with one platoon was
00:42:55.76 --> 00:43:02.40 stopped by heavy machine gun and direct 88 millimeter fire from point E f and D and was unable to advance
00:43:02.40 --> 00:43:06.72 i immediately move to the high ground so basically they get into a big gunfight
00:43:07.28 --> 00:43:12.64 and they can't they can't move forward and here's here's what i like i immediately move to the
00:43:12.64 --> 00:43:20.000 high ground 200 yards north where i could observe the enemy position so right now we have observed
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.12 happening getting on the high ground love that observe what's he doing why's he observing well
00:43:25.12 --> 00:43:30.24 because he's got to figure out what to do now he gets up in this observation position
00:43:31.20 --> 00:43:36.96 and he says the enemy had all of the high ground to the front and i could see it would be impossible
00:43:36.96 --> 00:43:43.28 to advance frontally so what does that mean now he's orienting himself to the situation
00:43:43.28 --> 00:43:47.20 oh the enemy's got all this high ground up here i can't advance friendly so then was it
00:43:47.20 --> 00:43:55.76 you do so i decided to make a double involvement sending company i over the hill to the right
00:43:55.76 --> 00:44:02.000 and company k on a wide left development contact was to be maintained visually so there's the action
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.20 he's at that that's it's actually happening so he goes through the loop in like four sentences which is totally
00:44:07.20 --> 00:44:08.64 legit
00:44:10.40 --> 00:44:14.40 base of fire five tanks were available for the attack realizing that the tanks could not move
00:44:14.40 --> 00:44:18.96 down the road to guardia which is the only tank approach due to the streams and high mountains
00:44:18.96 --> 00:44:22.48 and because the enemy had eighty-eighths and armored cars at f i decided to do in place the tanks
00:44:22.48 --> 00:44:27.44 along with my eight heavy machine guns and six eighty-one millimeter motors as shown in the sketch
00:44:27.44 --> 00:44:35.52 results the attack was successful by order the tanks and other supporting weapons opened fire five
00:44:35.52 --> 00:44:40.80 minutes before company l started its defense that is called cover move we got tanks and and supporting
00:44:40.80 --> 00:44:46.24 weapons firing and then company l starts their move after five minutes 15 prisoners were captured
00:44:46.24 --> 00:44:50.16 25 enemy killed our casualties were approximately ten killed and fifteen wounded
00:44:50.16 --> 00:44:57.44 which when you think about the assault on a you know in an urban environment you're going to take
00:44:57.44 --> 00:45:04.64 some casualties and those are certainly some casualties but those are not as bad as you might
00:45:04.64 --> 00:45:09.68 imagine going into a city when you consider the fact that if you don't know anything about urban combat
00:45:09.68 --> 00:45:16.96 one enemy with a machine gun can kill dozens and dozens of troops
00:45:16.96 --> 00:45:23.84 the enemy strength as determined from prisoners was two rifle companies each reinforced
00:45:25.12 --> 00:45:29.92 supported by tanks armored cars eighty-eighths along the road these prisoners stated that their
00:45:29.92 --> 00:45:35.28 force was so completely disorganized and demoralized by our volume of fire that and scheme of attack
00:45:35.28 --> 00:45:40.24 that was impossible for them to make a counterattack and regain their positions planning it
00:45:40.24 --> 00:45:45.76 took about two hours to make plans for this attack which was very carefully studied planned and coordinated
00:45:45.76 --> 00:45:52.72 it's funny it's sometimes the US military spends months making plans for an attack and and
00:45:53.60 --> 00:45:57.44 he said this took two hours but it was carefully studied planned and coordinated that's what
00:45:57.44 --> 00:46:02.32 he needed was a solid two hours it effectively you utilize the train features every weapon
00:46:02.32 --> 00:46:06.56 available to the battalion was used in such an attack maps must be pure range with critical points
00:46:06.56 --> 00:46:13.04 in phase lines once the attack has started the basic plan cannot be changed it must succeed that's
00:46:13.04 --> 00:46:20.000 an interesting statement and I think the word that I underland was basic you're not your head Dave like
00:46:21.68 --> 00:46:27.20 yeah my immediate reaction is must not be changed I get a like a sense of like well that's
00:46:27.20 --> 00:46:31.84 that but yeah you're right the basic plan of basic doesn't say we can't change so
00:46:31.84 --> 00:46:35.52 rather than sort of get all excited that he says he can't change the thing is to he's right
00:46:36.24 --> 00:46:41.36 especially at night and when you look at this whole situation you actually want to limit
00:46:41.36 --> 00:46:47.68 the amount of replanting a recoil you want to limit a lot of things now not the individual
00:46:47.68 --> 00:46:51.04 actions of the teams of maneuvering and things like that and let them make the adjustments but
00:46:51.04 --> 00:46:56.40 you don't want one element to go you know what let's cancel the development and just do something
00:46:56.40 --> 00:47:00.64 different and abandon your portion of the plane you actually can't do that so you actually need to
00:47:00.64 --> 00:47:05.44 keep the basic plan that that clarity actually made a lot of stuff yeah one word yeah that one
00:47:05.44 --> 00:47:09.68 word makes a big difference when you start thinking about what they're doing you've got what is
00:47:09.68 --> 00:47:16.24 an eight heavy machine guns since those guys are doing a fire a fire mission on this town for
00:47:16.24 --> 00:47:21.12 five minutes before you enter the town that's coordination you can't start thinking well you know
00:47:21.12 --> 00:47:26.40 I think I'm gonna go earlier whatever it is your the basic plan you got to stick with that basic plan
00:47:26.40 --> 00:47:35.60 then I this is something that I lived by if I if it was possible to stick with the basic plan
00:47:35.60 --> 00:47:40.64 I was sticking with the basic plan like it would have to be something really now we would have a
00:47:40.64 --> 00:47:47.68 contingency plan hey but if I could avoid using the contingency plan I would stick with the basic plan
00:47:47.68 --> 00:47:52.48 that we we we we rehearsed and we would rehearse the contingency too but yeah people expect what they're
00:47:52.48 --> 00:47:58.96 going to be doing we had the exact same philosophy we we had contingency plans but the part of that
00:47:58.96 --> 00:48:06.08 that made that possible is our plans were usually really fluid yeah some key limits you had some
00:48:06.08 --> 00:48:10.88 limiting decisions inside there but our plans weren't hyper detailed and super down to the
00:48:11.44 --> 00:48:15.44 so you could stick to the basic plan we used to have just a joke stick to the plan that was what we
00:48:15.44 --> 00:48:19.36 always said like what what did he do just stick to the plan that didn't mean you don't think you don't
00:48:19.36 --> 00:48:25.92 just make changes but the idea that what we planned and how we coordinated stick to that and then
00:48:25.92 --> 00:48:30.16 make smart decisions along the way to reinforce that as opposed to you get halfway there and then
00:48:30.16 --> 00:48:34.32 hey no we should do we should come up with a new plan like there's no time to come up with a new plan
00:48:34.32 --> 00:48:38.48 once you cross the line of departure you kind of need to stick to the plan the basic plan which
00:48:38.48 --> 00:48:45.04 also drove our plans to be basic we had very basic big picture plans yeah simple and flexible
00:48:45.92 --> 00:48:52.72 if you know if the three of us were going to go and take down a building and we say okay here's the
00:48:52.72 --> 00:48:57.68 way it's going to go once we get to the front door echo you're going to open the door
00:48:58.32 --> 00:49:03.84 Dave you're going to go left I'm going to go right and then echo you're going to go left and we
00:49:03.84 --> 00:49:10.16 okay and we rehearse that 10 times I promise you that as we approach that building there's going to be
00:49:10.16 --> 00:49:13.04 a civilian in the front yard that echoes going to have to deal with and all of a sudden that
00:49:13.04 --> 00:49:19.04 whole plan is out the window so you can't go to that level of detail and you definitely need to have
00:49:19.04 --> 00:49:23.20 flexibility there but the basic plan of hey we're going to approach the building totally that's not
00:49:23.20 --> 00:49:26.40 going to change because we know where the fire sport is it's set or a set or a set or
00:49:28.72 --> 00:49:33.12 estimating the situation in planning should be emphasized in training comment and this was I found
00:49:33.12 --> 00:49:40.24 this interesting too this account is a good example of fire movement on the batailing the
00:49:40.24 --> 00:49:45.92 I have no idea I guess I guess I got it from Roger Hayden why why I use the term cover move instead
00:49:45.92 --> 00:49:52.40 of fire movement because of the same thing but I same thing cover move and fire movement are the
00:49:52.40 --> 00:49:57.52 same thing this account at least as far as I know is it am I am I missing something I don't think so
00:49:57.52 --> 00:50:03.36 we use the term fire maneuver yeah that was the one element moves one element covers and I think
00:50:03.36 --> 00:50:09.04 it's anonymous yeah yeah however it should be pointed out that a double development is a rather
00:50:09.04 --> 00:50:13.76 ambitious scheme of maneuver for a single battalion and should be used with caution and I love
00:50:13.76 --> 00:50:21.20 seeing that because what you're talking about echo Charles is you're talking about a double
00:50:21.20 --> 00:50:30.24 development you're basically surrounding a target which means you got good guys on the flanks
00:50:30.24 --> 00:50:34.88 of bad guys and if you start shooting at the bad guys in the middle you can shoot yourself
00:50:34.88 --> 00:50:40.16 and it's really problematic the the thing about this and there would be occasional
00:50:40.16 --> 00:50:47.28 seal platoons it would go yeah we're gonna just surround the target it works when nothing goes wrong
00:50:47.28 --> 00:50:52.64 it works when the enemy doesn't start shooting it works if you have on the positive side it
00:50:52.64 --> 00:50:57.68 works if you have a terrain feature that prevents friendly fire which is possible you can have a
00:50:57.68 --> 00:51:05.92 you know a ravine that allows you to be in a certain position but when you when you do these
00:51:05.92 --> 00:51:10.64 battalion sized operations you're actually getting out of the you should be moving outside the
00:51:10.64 --> 00:51:16.56 range of your own weapons which is what the goal is right you know we're really far away and
00:51:16.56 --> 00:51:21.44 and as long as we are shooting our weapons at the enemy there's a very small chance that
00:51:21.44 --> 00:51:29.36 our weapons are gonna hit our friendly forces so be very careful about double development
00:51:30.88 --> 00:51:34.16 and same thing with going to an enemy's rear like if you're gonna do that
00:51:34.16 --> 00:51:39.44 well then you've got to pay attention to how that's gonna work out it is a lot harder than it looks
00:51:40.40 --> 00:51:46.72 no mention is made of the Constitution of a reserve force such a reserve must be retained under
00:51:46.72 --> 00:51:52.40 the control of the commander to enable to counter unforeseen enemy reaction as the attack progresses
00:51:52.40 --> 00:51:57.20 troops committed to a plan of action cannot be considered as available for this purpose
00:51:57.20 --> 00:52:04.56 the division of the battalion into a into approximately three equal attack forces is open
00:52:04.56 --> 00:52:12.08 a criticism but it worked in this case a schema maneuver should include a determination of the
00:52:12.08 --> 00:52:16.80 direction of the main effort and the provonorance of the force should be available to support this effort
00:52:17.84 --> 00:52:24.000 here's an interesting story so one of the great tactical lessons learned of my life which I learned
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:32.24 and training when you so we would set up you know to do target assaults typical does any army manual
00:52:32.24 --> 00:52:36.64 any any marine corps manual of how you do a target assault you know you set up a base element
00:52:36.64 --> 00:52:41.36 and a maneuver element so the base element is gonna engage the target it gets in position
00:52:41.36 --> 00:52:45.60 and it shoots at the target once it's shot at the target for a certain amount of time
00:52:45.60 --> 00:52:50.24 the assault element then gets up and maneuvers towards the target when they get to a certain
00:52:50.24 --> 00:52:55.44 point the people shooting at the target shift fire off the target but they keep shooting and eventually
00:52:55.44 --> 00:53:04.000 they move the assault team moves through the target and I was watching a young junior officer
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.60 I was in training at Celtine 1 and he he said okay what we're gonna do is for our base element
00:53:09.60 --> 00:53:13.68 that's gonna do all the shooting at the target area what we're gonna do is we're gonna take our
00:53:13.68 --> 00:53:20.000 machine gunners from the other from the assault element who asked to move we're gonna move
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.88 the machine gunners into the base element we're gonna take some of the riflemen and put them in
00:53:22.88 --> 00:53:26.08 the assault elements so they can move easier and they can get through the target and I said
00:53:26.08 --> 00:53:29.92 that's thinking myself that's pretty smart smart guy is gonna get a really strong base element
00:53:31.76 --> 00:53:38.24 Vietnam vet said what are you doing he said well you know you know master she if I'm gonna
00:53:38.24 --> 00:53:42.64 go ahead and put heavy or stronger base over here and the machine gun element and put all my
00:53:42.64 --> 00:53:46.64 machine guns over in the base element and I'm like I can already tell I'm glad I didn't
00:53:46.64 --> 00:53:53.76 come up with this plan but why is that you know he says well because I want to have more
00:53:53.76 --> 00:53:58.24 machine guns I want to have more firepower in my base element and then the the mask
00:53:58.24 --> 00:54:04.24 shooting one question said what happens if the assault element gets compromised on the way in
00:54:07.36 --> 00:54:12.48 end of discussion because now we don't have any machine guns and and by the way what should
00:54:12.48 --> 00:54:16.56 happen is if we have machine guns in the assault element the assault element just became
00:54:16.56 --> 00:54:22.48 the base element that's what just happened so and and the thing that the other lesson that I
00:54:22.48 --> 00:54:28.16 learned from that was that what you really get to do the other benefit which I actually would
00:54:28.16 --> 00:54:34.64 say isn't even bigger benefit is we have unit integrity which I love unit integrity that squad
00:54:34.64 --> 00:54:38.72 or that platoon's always working together the machine gunners are there they can break off they
00:54:38.72 --> 00:54:42.32 can assault things they can do all kinds of things where when you pull those machine gunners out
00:54:42.32 --> 00:54:52.48 they're not they're way less capable so apply that to your business to your team how do we keep
00:54:52.48 --> 00:54:59.60 the teams together how do we keep the teams together how do we keep them both how do we keep
00:54:59.60 --> 00:55:09.20 them most capable that's what we want to do setting up a little specialty moments is a risky call
00:55:09.20 --> 00:55:15.68 factors contributing to the success in this attack were prompt estimate of the situation by the
00:55:15.68 --> 00:55:20.96 commander including a study of the terrain based on personal reconnaissance development of a
00:55:20.96 --> 00:55:25.44 definite plan of maneuver based on the seizure of key terrain and outflanking enemy position
00:55:25.44 --> 00:55:31.60 detail planning of specific orders utilization of maximum firepower where available maintenance
00:55:31.60 --> 00:55:37.84 of control over the elements little section here on fighting and wooded terrain lieutenant
00:55:37.84 --> 00:55:43.28 Colonel F.L. Walker infantry battalion commander Italy the area in which my battalion operated
00:55:43.28 --> 00:55:49.04 was covered in thick scrub trees and fruit orchards interspersed with frequent farmhouses many
00:55:49.04 --> 00:55:55.12 stone walls six to eight feet in height and numerous sunken roads field of fire was greatly restricted
00:55:55.12 --> 00:56:01.60 average observation was only 52 hundred yards enemy delaying groups with machine guns were widely
00:56:01.60 --> 00:56:08.48 scattered and impossible locate until arrival within a hundred yards or less it was found necessary
00:56:08.48 --> 00:56:13.28 to place heavy weapons out in the front line or very close up to avoid hitting our troops
00:56:13.92 --> 00:56:19.12 after encountering hostile fire was found very effective to spray the entire woods ahead with a
00:56:19.12 --> 00:56:23.84 massive concentration of mortar machine gunfire for about one minute followed by a rapid advance of
00:56:23.84 --> 00:56:29.20 rifle platoons under a salt fire to cover all the trees and house windows where snipers might
00:56:29.20 --> 00:56:33.60 be hiding in each case Germans pulled out rapidly leaving weapons and ammunition behind
00:56:33.60 --> 00:56:38.72 although we had been unable to locate them previously however the tendency of troops
00:56:39.76 --> 00:56:45.44 is to wait for definitely located targets before they will open fire which results in allowing
00:56:45.44 --> 00:56:51.76 very small groups of enemy to shift position frequently and keep up a demoralizing rate of
00:56:51.76 --> 00:56:57.36 machine gunfire to cause a great delay the continuous rapid fire delivered by our heavy
00:56:57.36 --> 00:57:05.12 machine guns had a particularly demoralizing effect on the Germans. The remarks of this
00:57:05.12 --> 00:57:10.000 battalion commander emphasized the importance of barrage covering fire the fire power of available
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:16.32 weapons in this instance substitute for our artillery but roge but the principle remains the same
00:57:16.32 --> 00:57:21.28 cover move losses will be minimized by following closely the mass fires of available weapons
00:57:21.28 --> 00:57:28.96 delivered in areas from which enemy fire is expected I think the enemy might be there on
00:57:28.96 --> 00:57:35.84 putting rounds into it and it's an interesting how that one dynamic think about that learn that lesson
00:57:35.84 --> 00:57:43.12 learned of realizing hey what we need to do is lay down heavy fire where every we think there
00:57:43.12 --> 00:57:49.36 might be enemy and push forward as quickly as we can think about that lesson learned think
00:57:49.36 --> 00:57:52.24 about the first time and happens the first time and happens you're like oh where are they where
00:57:52.24 --> 00:57:57.36 are they no one shooting and then someone goes hey put out fire and advance
00:57:58.40 --> 00:58:01.84 guys start laying down fire and they start laying down fire where they think there's enemy
00:58:03.04 --> 00:58:07.44 and then that allows you to get the enemies heads down because they are somewhere out there
00:58:07.44 --> 00:58:10.96 and you get their heads down and now you're maneuvering and when you're maneuvering they're not
00:58:10.96 --> 00:58:17.04 and now you win but can you imagine that that's a little bit off of our instinct right as a human
00:58:17.04 --> 00:58:22.24 if you don't if you don't if you don't get trained that way your instinct is not hey I'm just
00:58:22.24 --> 00:58:25.52 gonna shoot where I think there's bad guys I'm gonna shoot not a little dark corner over there I'm
00:58:25.52 --> 00:58:29.76 gonna shoot not window over there I'm gonna shoot near that stone wall over there you haven't seen one
00:58:29.76 --> 00:58:34.08 enemy but that's where you're shooting and now you have a whole company of soldiers doing that that's
00:58:34.08 --> 00:58:38.40 a lot of firepower going down range and it allows you to move because somewhere in one of those positions
00:58:38.40 --> 00:58:45.04 there was enemy but think about what it took to learn that lesson and how valuable that lesson
00:58:45.04 --> 00:58:51.60 right there is to be able to tell people and it also talks about the importance of speed which is the
00:58:51.60 --> 00:58:58.80 next note regimental commander infantry Sicily I believe that the individual soldier now realizes
00:58:58.80 --> 00:59:05.12 that a relentless steady advance saves casualties and that he is now imbued with the knowledge of the
00:59:05.12 --> 00:59:10.72 importance of speed every man in this regiment is firmly convinced that the speed of our recent
00:59:10.72 --> 00:59:17.52 operations saved us from huge losses down to the lowest private the feeling exists that we would still
00:59:17.52 --> 00:59:25.20 be at can of saudi if we had not pushed the enemy off balance and kept in that way
00:59:29.20 --> 00:59:34.72 you know how often are we sitting there waiting for the perfect plan the perfect whatever
00:59:34.72 --> 00:59:38.96 on what we should be doing is moving right you you want to just bring this down to work and
00:59:38.96 --> 00:59:45.60 now echo Charles since that seems to be your main you know topic for the day yeah cool yes so
00:59:45.60 --> 00:59:50.32 let's look at two options one alright what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go research on the internet
00:59:50.32 --> 00:59:56.08 you know what the max time under load I need to do for this particular workout right time under tension
00:59:56.08 --> 01:00:04.08 you love a mobile right become up with a my periodicity for my periodization my periodization
01:00:04.08 --> 01:00:10.80 for my workouts right all these things that you could spend two hours to research and then writing
01:00:10.80 --> 01:00:16.08 and mapping out or you could go do a bunch of clean and jerks just go yeah there isn't
01:00:16.08 --> 01:00:21.92 advantage to doing clean and jerks look I'm not saying you got to be an idiot no but there are
01:00:21.92 --> 01:00:28.72 some some positive things to just going yes and keeping moving and firing where you think it might
01:00:28.72 --> 01:00:38.40 hey I don't know about the the the the internal bicep hand or whatever the break you'll
01:00:38.40 --> 01:00:44.56 head of the bicep which I know you probably got some little high tuned exercise in short
01:00:44.56 --> 01:00:50.40 hands yeah there you go see you do certain types of curls with the easy part of hit that target right
01:00:51.28 --> 01:00:56.24 whereas you could just say hey let's face it go do some curls right yeah actually you're right
01:00:56.24 --> 01:01:00.64 I actually agree with the hundred percent I agree with that philosophy in working out yeah I mean
01:01:00.64 --> 01:01:04.88 there's a couple of things you want to know otherwise you're just kind of you know moving around
01:01:04.88 --> 01:01:11.44 with with no specific direction which I you know teach their own but yeah I think that actually
01:01:11.44 --> 01:01:18.64 is a very good analogy you know you see sort out what am I trying to do here um get a few basic methods
01:01:18.64 --> 01:01:24.56 on try to you know how to achieve it and this go especially when you start coupling that attitude
01:01:24.56 --> 01:01:29.60 with the fact that we don't want to move in the first place right that inertia we're just trying
01:01:29.60 --> 01:01:35.60 to stay still and now we can we can we can focus on that by just doing a bunch of planning like
01:01:35.60 --> 01:01:40.64 hey I'm just waiting to see where the bad guys are I'm just waiting no freaking lay down fire
01:01:40.64 --> 01:01:44.24 that's that's the way you wake up in the morning you wake up in the morning saying I'm
01:01:44.24 --> 01:01:51.84 going to put down fire that's what I'm doing yeah you're right about that too how you you're
01:01:51.84 --> 01:01:56.48 like oh wait let me try to remember what I was going to do today and be like well I
01:01:56.48 --> 01:02:00.64 should maybe she did because tomorrow I'm going to do this so maybe I shouldn't do this you know
01:02:00.64 --> 01:02:05.76 I shouldn't do it that hard or and you know and you've spent all this time and then it's like well
01:02:05.76 --> 01:02:12.48 shoot if I do the whole workout now shoot dinners like in like 45 minutes so maybe I should
01:02:12.48 --> 01:02:16.56 I don't know what you're just saying depends on when you work out I guess true and you know
01:02:16.56 --> 01:02:21.52 not in your case for sure maybe you're breakfast or whatever but yeah and then you're like oh that's
01:02:21.52 --> 01:02:26.08 45 minutes that only gives me like 10 minutes to work like or one minute to warm up and maybe
01:02:26.08 --> 01:02:30.48 I mean I might just do this tomorrow that way I could get the whole thing done you see them saying
01:02:30.48 --> 01:02:34.16 then yeah brother all that planning not only did it not a lot of that not matter
01:02:34.16 --> 01:02:39.28 meanwhile weakness is winning in your body mean what weakness is winning man and then there's that
01:02:39.28 --> 01:02:45.28 I do avoid yeah is that I think it was you we talked about I don't know whatever but yeah
01:02:45.28 --> 01:02:49.04 when you let the weakness creep in you give that weakness a precedent you know so the
01:02:49.04 --> 01:02:54.88 the weakness is sort of like oh yeah I kind of approved my my my my presence kind of thing
01:02:54.88 --> 01:03:00.24 I was talking about this on a year phone line the other day I I've been doing this lately in my head
01:03:01.68 --> 01:03:06.000 so and I haven't quite figured out what this means but I know it's been very functional
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:20.32 when you have like an option of doing a bad thing or just not doing the bad thing that reaction
01:03:20.32 --> 01:03:25.52 of just not doing the bad thing isn't strong enough I've actually been trying to do something good
01:03:26.96 --> 01:03:32.000 okay does that make sense I think let me let me get some example oh there's a donut over there
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.24 you know what I'm not gonna eat the donut that's not strong enough not not only may not
01:03:38.24 --> 01:03:45.04 gonna eat the donut I'm actually gonna go and do 20 burpees yeah and you know it doesn't even
01:03:45.04 --> 01:03:48.72 have to be extreme because guess what you you're working or whatever and just like I just want
01:03:48.72 --> 01:03:52.48 to have a no no no I'm not gonna eat that donut and you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go and
01:03:53.60 --> 01:03:59.20 get my desk cleared off right now yeah kind of see yeah doing something but actually proactive
01:03:59.20 --> 01:04:08.88 to crush to crush that weakness that's wanting to grab it just it's like if you it's like you know
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.80 if I say hey echo echo you know you you want to you want to come by my house and
01:04:17.52 --> 01:04:23.04 and grill up some steaks and let's say you don't really feel like doing it and so you're like well
01:04:23.04 --> 01:04:27.28 you know what I mean I'm gonna pressure you but if you're like negative I'm already doing something
01:04:27.28 --> 01:04:32.08 I'm like okay that case closed right case closed you already want yeah so I'm just saying going a
01:04:32.08 --> 01:04:37.52 little bit harder at the weakness yeah it's a little trend I've been right now yeah and that and that
01:04:37.52 --> 01:04:41.84 works I mean it depends on what you mean by works but that's a good move that's like yeah you know
01:04:41.84 --> 01:04:47.84 like yeah I'm about to like okay I have burpees at the end of this workout I've finished the
01:04:47.84 --> 01:04:53.44 work I work out with hundred burpees we'll say I'll be like man now workout was pretty solid you
01:04:53.44 --> 01:04:57.20 know I don't know about those burpees you know let's we'll do those burpees another time we're
01:04:57.20 --> 01:05:01.60 gonna skip the burpees is what we're gonna do then this comes time to skip the point you're like you
01:05:01.60 --> 01:05:07.04 know what no hundred fifty or two hundred now just for thinking that you know oh yeah you're going
01:05:07.04 --> 01:05:11.60 hard on weakness yes that's a positive that I think you're right I'm gonna start like this
01:05:11.60 --> 01:05:16.88 this ties in for me I'm gonna start laying down fire I'm gonna start being even more proactive
01:05:16.88 --> 01:05:21.60 I start seeing weakness I'm laying down fire I'm putting my buttons of morgue around so bad stuff
01:05:21.60 --> 01:05:28.80 you know what you write down Dave I think we went so far away from whatever I'm not sure I can
01:05:28.80 --> 01:05:36.72 bring us back we're talking about burpees and bicep levels bro you talked about bias before so
01:05:36.72 --> 01:05:39.60 actually it might be a little connection if we think about it first I mean you were talking about
01:05:40.16 --> 01:05:45.44 well you actually weren't talking about bias I had the word bias in my mind when we had a plan
01:05:45.44 --> 01:05:48.40 hey we're gonna go to the building you're gonna go to the the East Airwell you're gonna go to the
01:05:48.40 --> 01:05:52.48 West and hey we that might not happen we might have to do something different we used to brief
01:05:52.48 --> 01:05:57.12 gun on missions these general missions like hey all things being equal I want you to bias to the
01:05:57.12 --> 01:06:02.32 South and if you know we get additional pressure you're gonna be the the element that biases
01:06:02.32 --> 01:06:05.76 to the South now look something may come up where you can't do that and that's fine you may go to
01:06:05.76 --> 01:06:12.000 the North go ahead let me know but our plan is that all things being equal we're gonna bias in this
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.80 direction which allows you to keep my plans like really general yeah that's about this general
01:06:16.80 --> 01:06:22.64 yeah and it's but it's it's not completely like out and nowhere we don't have some idea but
01:06:22.64 --> 01:06:27.28 it's like hey these are the things we're anticipating and all things being equal I want you were
01:06:27.28 --> 01:06:34.000 we were talking about the the inertia thing which is kind of bugged me from the beginning but I
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.36 actually was thinking about as you were saying it is you know he's talking about like the laws
01:06:39.36 --> 01:06:45.28 of physics whereas objects in at rest tend to stay at rest and objects in motion tend to stay
01:06:45.28 --> 01:06:51.76 in motion and the hard part is getting the the staying at rest and getting it to the motion like
01:06:51.76 --> 01:06:56.16 once you get the motion going actually it's not that hard to keep it going it's the friction of
01:06:56.80 --> 01:07:01.76 doing nothing and is that connection you look you said I know you didn't invent it but this idea
01:07:01.76 --> 01:07:07.12 of default aggressive this bias for doing something is the hardest thing to get which is
01:07:07.84 --> 01:07:13.84 the natural bias of doing something and when you made that comment about when I see weakness
01:07:13.84 --> 01:07:19.28 or I feel weakness the natural bias is oh no I'm not going to give into that weakness
01:07:20.24 --> 01:07:23.68 I'm going to do nothing which everyone's like that's the win and you're like no actually
01:07:23.68 --> 01:07:30.000 that's not the win the win is not to do nothing no is it better than anything you don't it yes
01:07:30.40 --> 01:07:34.56 but we're not here to just not eat donuts that's not the game we're playing over here the game
01:07:34.56 --> 01:07:40.24 we're playing is just not to eat the donuts and he started the very first thing is leadership
01:07:40.24 --> 01:07:47.76 versus inertia it's that how hard is it to get the movement to do something but once you have
01:07:47.76 --> 01:07:56.000 that bias that bias to maneuver and that starts not that hard it actually gets easier every
01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:01.44 single time so that's my connection to things you were saying and yeah I'm going to let you guys
01:08:01.44 --> 01:08:05.52 talk about what it is you talk about but that's what I was thinking about is that what that bias really
01:08:05.52 --> 01:08:09.52 means to tie back to the very first thing that I kind of thought about was like what did you talk about
01:08:09.52 --> 01:08:13.76 because I think inertia is movement and inertia is not movement it's just the state that you're in
01:08:13.76 --> 01:08:17.76 inertia could be doing nothing and that's what you're talking about it's breaking out of that
01:08:17.76 --> 01:08:24.000 and the bias to move which is the the most challenging thing yeah I talk about pushing a train
01:08:24.64 --> 01:08:29.44 you know and I was like hey if you're going to push your train the first getting that thing to
01:08:29.44 --> 01:08:35.12 start moving is the hardest part and you start pushing you push you push and it eventually
01:08:35.12 --> 01:08:40.32 starts to move a little bit and then you get to a point if you keep pushing that thing where you can
01:08:40.32 --> 01:08:44.48 actually like grab onto the railing and hang on for a second it's just going to keep going you
01:08:44.48 --> 01:08:48.64 started it when you were talking about blast and rocket ship out of here exactly you can actually
01:08:48.64 --> 01:08:55.76 use 90% of your effort to get that in your need you don't need 90% you can coast the rest of the
01:08:55.76 --> 01:09:01.04 way once you break free of that gravitational force of like literally I'm just going to I'm just
01:09:01.04 --> 01:09:06.56 on the train now yeah now look if you can just jump on a speeding train go for it but most of us most
01:09:06.56 --> 01:09:11.28 people have to actually get that train from a dead stop and move it yeah you've ever seen those guys
01:09:11.28 --> 01:09:18.72 roll up a frying pan like a piece of paper I think I think that's like the the method
01:09:19.28 --> 01:09:23.44 really yeah like you hit it like real hard of that initial button then it like heats up the
01:09:23.44 --> 01:09:29.76 molecule so it becomes more yeah in some mistaken unless I got tricked or something like that
01:09:29.76 --> 01:09:34.88 and it's one big trick but I'm pretty sure that the cause it's always a strong man right
01:09:34.88 --> 01:09:40.24 strongman it's the week and rolling up a frying pan I'll tell you that but it's usually like a
01:09:40.24 --> 01:09:46.88 feet of strength so now I wonder if it's like you're seeming to bring it some sort of molecular
01:09:46.88 --> 01:09:52.000 level which I'm not sure about that was the explanation for real they're like this is the trick
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.20 this is how you do it you know what I do not know if you're right and I do not know if you are wrong
01:09:57.20 --> 01:10:02.08 I'm gonna just leave it hanging and people will let us know and we will get someone with a frying pan
01:10:02.32 --> 01:10:08.80 posting it and telling us hey echo Charles is 100% right or echo Charles
01:10:09.44 --> 01:10:17.28 Bruce Hans the most likely outcome of this is either of those it's bro echo talking about frying
01:10:17.28 --> 01:10:22.64 pans when we're talking about combat that's the most likely out of the concept and everywhere there's
01:10:22.64 --> 01:10:26.88 so much I can do to keep us on topic here echo I'm just saying if you can work with a frying pan
01:10:26.88 --> 01:10:31.36 brats good and rocket ships and whatnot it can work with like every day stuff and I actually think
01:10:31.36 --> 01:10:37.20 echo is the premier example in the world premier example of in the world in the entire world of
01:10:39.12 --> 01:10:43.60 if you know the way bro you see it and all things you're seeing combat in a frying pan
01:10:43.60 --> 01:10:49.12 yeah these these ideas are everywhere but there was uh the well it's far as feet of strength go
01:10:49.12 --> 01:10:52.96 there's the ripping the phone book one yeah right I think there's a little trick there's an
01:10:52.96 --> 01:10:57.76 one you got like unbunch and we're bunching but I think your point is that that initial the initial
01:10:57.76 --> 01:11:04.000 break is the hard part is hard part so that's where you use technique roll roll okay how it
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.72 went was the the curling up of the frying pan how it's explained is you hit it with that first
01:11:10.72 --> 01:11:17.28 force of the rolling action but you just can't like you can't hit one and then re-grip and hit
01:11:17.28 --> 01:11:21.28 another one it's not like that you gotta hit it once and just keep keep going don't let like the
01:11:21.28 --> 01:11:28.32 momentum stop because the molecules are still heated up for that moment it's a more malleable
01:11:28.32 --> 01:11:33.28 whatever that's how it was explained to me we're gonna look at that you're going out on the limb I
01:11:33.28 --> 01:11:38.48 like you you got no problem taking risk I like the way you will next one the herd instinct major
01:11:38.48 --> 01:11:44.88 Robert Wilson observer with the at exhibition they don't name the division and Italy our troops
01:11:44.88 --> 01:11:49.36 echoes taking a note maybe he's concerned that's getting edited oh you're going strong no you're
01:11:49.36 --> 01:11:55.44 all good our troops showed a decided tendency to bunch up under fire this was observed on
01:11:55.44 --> 01:12:00.000 several occasions one prisoner war a German forward observer from 88 millimeter battery
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.72 was interrogated concerning his technique of adjustment it seems he had been told that American
01:12:04.72 --> 01:12:09.92 troops congregated one under fire when he saw American troops advancing he would call for one or two
01:12:09.92 --> 01:12:16.16 rounds in their vicinity and observe the area where they congregated fire was then shifted to that
01:12:16.16 --> 01:12:20.48 area the prisoner stated that he conducted very effective fire in this way in several occasions on
01:12:20.48 --> 01:12:26.24 Italy don't bunch up don't bunch up leaders of strategy and tactics talk about this
01:12:26.24 --> 01:12:31.28 one of my leadership perspective let the leader lead you don't need to jump in there and crowd
01:12:31.28 --> 01:12:36.64 the leader everyone could get no dilatary let me tell you my opinion listen what the malle's has to
01:12:36.64 --> 01:12:42.40 say if you want some suggestions give it to them don't crowd don't bunch up base of fire lieutenant
01:12:42.40 --> 01:12:50.000 Colonel jm fan infantry battalion commander it was found that so long as japs could keep us
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:56.000 ducking from aimed fire their position remained secure but once the jap was made to keep his head
01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.24 down in the Americans could get to his feet in attack there's merely a matter of walking up
01:13:00.24 --> 01:13:06.96 the position in tossing ingrown aids to make this possible require the coordination of fires down
01:13:06.96 --> 01:13:11.92 to an including the riflemen it is important that commanders and leaders realize this otherwise
01:13:11.92 --> 01:13:21.84 troops were remained down when it's not necessary so amazing it's so amazing cover move teamwork
01:13:21.84 --> 01:13:27.28 down to the lowest level yeah and I just said teamwork and guess what the next section's called
01:13:27.28 --> 01:13:32.56 and I did not look at this the next section of teamwork we would have a riflemen point out a pill
01:13:32.56 --> 01:13:37.76 box using tracer ammunition then a 37 millimeter gun would take them under fire with high explosives
01:13:37.76 --> 01:13:41.84 oftentimes a pill box crew to tempt to evacuate to a safer place and the light machine gun would
01:13:41.84 --> 01:13:49.44 mode them down isn't it interesting when we talk about teamwork and we talk about cover move
01:13:49.44 --> 01:13:58.24 the reason that it is such an incredible metaphor is because if you don't cover and move you don't
01:13:58.24 --> 01:14:03.84 win it's as simple as that if you don't have one element that's shooting at the japones
01:14:04.48 --> 01:14:09.60 while the other element is walking up and if you don't do that you lose that's what happens you lose
01:14:09.60 --> 01:14:22.08 if you do that you win if you work together as a team you win here's Lieutenant Colonel TF Boger
01:14:22.08 --> 01:14:29.84 infantry officer Italy one night in the vicinity of avalino the batina established an outpost line
01:14:29.84 --> 01:14:34.72 around the high ground to the northeast city patrols were ordered up several roads leading out of the
01:14:34.72 --> 01:14:39.20 city all company commanders were informed of the dispositions the patrols were now before the
01:14:39.20 --> 01:14:45.44 outposts were posted a few hours later firing was heard at the batina cp which increased in tempo
01:14:45.44 --> 01:14:52.40 and kept up most of the night soon reports were sent that sent in that German patrols were operating
01:14:52.40 --> 01:14:57.20 in front of the outposts I'm sure you all know let's come in next morning it became apparent that
01:14:57.20 --> 01:15:04.24 our own patrols had been fired on as they attempted to return to the outpost line comment the constant
01:15:04.24 --> 01:15:10.64 recurrence of such reports indicates the necessity for closer coordination of patrol activity
01:15:10.64 --> 01:15:16.80 with the outposts of with the outpost system positive steps must be taken to ensure that the roots
01:15:16.80 --> 01:15:21.20 of returning patrols are known to the outposts and that recognition signals are arranged
01:15:23.04 --> 01:15:28.48 blue on blue no one thinks it's gonna happen no one thinks it's gonna happen
01:15:28.48 --> 01:15:38.48 I never never even thought about blue on blue it was like such a it seemed like such a
01:15:38.48 --> 01:15:43.12 I shouldn't say we never thought about it but it seemed like such a foreign idea you think how
01:15:43.12 --> 01:15:48.80 could that ever happen the way I know and everything's just gonna happen to them but that's
01:15:48.80 --> 01:15:54.40 they always know what happens but it always happens to somebody else some other teams
01:15:54.40 --> 01:16:00.16 so it never happens to them I mean even that comment is like the common a current or
01:16:00.16 --> 01:16:04.64 a common debrief that we got on this and whatever you said like how often they heard that same exact
01:16:04.64 --> 01:16:06.24 story
01:16:10.56 --> 01:16:15.28 notes from other arms there's another one about just staying off the skyline right don't give away your
01:16:15.28 --> 01:16:22.16 position I just had to highlight this process section about what it was like when they had
01:16:22.16 --> 01:16:28.16 an entire craft versus when they didn't have it and the title of this section is absence makes the
01:16:28.16 --> 01:16:34.64 heart grow longer and what it was like and and what he says in here is that the
01:16:35.84 --> 01:16:40.56 rarely would the anti aircraft actually hit a German aircraft that was strafing them who rarely
01:16:40.56 --> 01:16:47.20 happened but when the anti aircraft wasn't there the German aircraft would just come down and just hammer
01:16:47.20 --> 01:16:58.96 free ray radio discipline first lieutenant CE plays air corps Sicily flyers coming into the combat
01:16:58.96 --> 01:17:08.80 zone had no conception of radio discipline Dave new pilots use the radio indiscriminately
01:17:08.80 --> 01:17:14.16 men returning from missions use the interplane radio unnecessarily which jammed up the band for
01:17:14.16 --> 01:17:20.24 other planes still on a mission comment failure to observe radio discipline is a major problem for
01:17:20.24 --> 01:17:27.52 both air and ground units in combat each individual believes his case is a special one not bound
01:17:27.52 --> 01:17:33.20 by established rules this tendency must be discouraged by positive action radio discipline is
01:17:33.20 --> 01:17:37.52 established to facilitate essential communications during combat and it's not a peace time play
01:17:37.52 --> 01:17:45.68 thing to be discarded when action is joined and this is this is task unit bruiser we were freaking
01:17:45.68 --> 01:17:52.24 awesome at radio discipline we did not talk on the radio in fact there would be operations where some
01:17:53.04 --> 01:18:00.48 some task units might use two or even three separate radio nets to coordinate and in task unit
01:18:00.48 --> 01:18:08.96 bruiser we would use one and it would be almost completely silent so yeah and and how is this
01:18:08.96 --> 01:18:14.000 transite in the regular life it's talking all the time it's not having discipline what the hell you say
01:18:15.20 --> 01:18:22.000 just feeling like you got to throw in your two cents all the time yeah yes for those of you that aren't
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:29.12 seeing this I'm looking right right at my friend echo Charles whatever graphic in you know when I
01:18:29.12 --> 01:18:35.28 talk I think anyway I don't know I could be wrong here maybe I'm trying to just support the point
01:18:35.28 --> 01:18:40.16 you know bring it down to every day level right on I think there's a lot of supporters out there at
01:18:40.16 --> 01:18:48.72 least yeah the radio discipline thing isn't weird to this idea that everyone in combat each
01:18:48.72 --> 01:18:55.68 individual believes his case is a special one that's such a derogatory statement and you know what's
01:18:55.68 --> 01:19:02.000 funny about that derogatory statement everyone that hears it thinks they're talking about someone else
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:09.84 like that's not me but it is you you are talking and no one wants to hear you and what you have to
01:19:09.84 --> 01:19:15.68 say isn't that important is that kind of like talking about your dreams with your friend
01:19:15.68 --> 01:19:22.56 you ever like to ever get your friend but I can't you know if I can you know when your friend
01:19:22.56 --> 01:19:26.32 is like hey I had the stream last night and it was but and it's not about you or nothing but
01:19:26.32 --> 01:19:31.28 this is just the weirdest dream aren't you like brow who cares you know but if you ever find
01:19:31.28 --> 01:19:36.88 yourself telling whoever about your dream it seems like it's so interesting it was just so bizarre
01:19:36.88 --> 01:19:43.52 and all this stuff you know the person is like bro you're quiet you know radio sound resounding metaphor
01:19:43.52 --> 01:20:00.40 complete capture documents big section about a ponsourcing the bodies they found a map of
01:20:00.40 --> 01:20:04.88 the second lieutenant and dispatch immediately to the regimental command post by runner next day
01:20:04.88 --> 01:20:09.44 the translation of this map is returned to first battalion it showed the Japanese defensive plan
01:20:09.44 --> 01:20:15.92 and proved very effective in eliminating Japanese from that area when they attacked it not only marked
01:20:15.92 --> 01:20:20.96 maps but also documents of less apparent importance may furnish the key to enemy plans
01:20:20.96 --> 01:20:27.04 when combined with other information the necessity for prompt forwarding to higher headquarters
01:20:27.04 --> 01:20:31.44 of all captured documents must be impressed on all ranks and I'll tell you why I wanted to bring that
01:20:31.44 --> 01:20:36.64 up because this is something we get told about until all the time is you know hey look you might
01:20:36.64 --> 01:20:43.36 find a piece of paper that's got the word purple on it and you bring that you know hey this what
01:20:43.36 --> 01:20:48.56 I found on target that could be some code word that you didn't know about it and it's it
01:20:48.56 --> 01:20:57.20 you don't know so whenever you think you know you're wrong whenever you think all that doesn't
01:20:57.20 --> 01:21:03.76 mean anything you're wrong and so when someone is talking to you and you think you know you're wrong
01:21:03.76 --> 01:21:08.88 you don't know they got some perspective that you don't know so listen to it listen to it
01:21:10.56 --> 01:21:15.84 I have to put myself in checks sometimes when I'll get asked a question like what working with a client
01:21:16.72 --> 01:21:23.68 and someone will give me a question and I'm telling you I have you I know you you have to
01:21:23.68 --> 01:21:29.36 experience this two-day someone someone raised their hand hey I want to know when it comes to
01:21:29.36 --> 01:21:34.48 cover move if I'm working with another department and they don't we already know where that
01:21:34.48 --> 01:21:38.72 question is going right there's like a 98% chance that we know that they're going to say hey
01:21:38.72 --> 01:21:42.16 this other department doesn't care about me and they don't really support us so what what what
01:21:42.16 --> 01:21:45.92 what am I supposed to do then just keep so what we we've heard that question we hear that question
01:21:45.92 --> 01:21:52.16 a lot I always have to put myself in check because just because I think that's what they're going
01:21:52.16 --> 01:21:56.08 to say doesn't mean that's what they're going to say it doesn't mean that there's not some
01:21:56.08 --> 01:22:01.36 nuance to it doesn't mean that I can spit out some module about how you you know well you
01:22:01.36 --> 01:22:07.68 continue to support them no listen to what they're saying don't stop them from talking
01:22:10.64 --> 01:22:15.84 you know the the minute somewhere I see this in group dynamics you know there's a discussion going on
01:22:15.84 --> 01:22:22.48 and someone's talking and someone else someone else in the group will cut them off
01:22:22.48 --> 01:22:30.000 and this is another thing I talked about on the F online think about how disrespeckful it is
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.96 to cut someone off right like you might not say anything to me but if you're talking and I just jump
01:22:34.96 --> 01:22:41.28 in cut you off and just just without regard just just start to cut you off think about how
01:22:41.28 --> 01:22:46.88 do you consider that disrespectful echo trails yes or anything most people recognize that that is
01:22:46.88 --> 01:22:51.92 disrespectful and so they try to stop themselves from doing it they can't always control their
01:22:51.92 --> 01:22:58.16 egos they can't always like let it continue and I'll tell you I think being on podcast have you
01:22:58.16 --> 01:23:04.000 ever noticed when two people that have podcasts are on the same podcast they'll let the other
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.64 person talk and it sort of let the person complete thoughts because podcasts is sort of an amplified
01:23:08.64 --> 01:23:13.84 version of if all of a sudden we're talking over each other it's just painful to listen to but then
01:23:13.84 --> 01:23:18.40 if you get someone that's not really a podcast type person or haven't hasn't done a lot of
01:23:18.40 --> 01:23:25.60 time they'll be jumping in and wanting to talk and it makes it hard to listen to so to me I think
01:23:25.60 --> 01:23:33.04 that's that's enhanced my my my listening right because I if I have a guest on here and they want to
01:23:33.04 --> 01:23:37.52 talk it's like okay I'm gonna let them complete their sentence and what I've realized over the years
01:23:37.52 --> 01:23:41.84 is that when I let someone do that there's usually some nuggets in there that I didn't know about
01:23:41.84 --> 01:23:46.96 so I'm actually gonna listen to what you have to say and the minute when I hear someone at
01:23:46.96 --> 01:23:50.88 you know at a will be working with a company and you'll hear someone say you know someone's
01:23:50.88 --> 01:23:56.80 mid sentence and boom gets cut off and overrun and here's what I was explaining on a F online the other
01:23:56.80 --> 01:24:05.04 day we all recognize that as disrespectful but it's seldom that we recognize the opposite which is
01:24:05.04 --> 01:24:12.08 when I'm listening to you I am showing you respect and you subconsciously know that like the
01:24:12.08 --> 01:24:16.96 the person that you're talking to when you listen to them they subconsciously feel respected
01:24:17.68 --> 01:24:20.96 which is a good which is a great thing because we're trying to build a relationship we're trying
01:24:20.96 --> 01:24:27.04 to build trust and it's incredible how this tool of listening is so powerful in increasing
01:24:27.04 --> 01:24:32.48 the trust in relationships that we can work to better together as a team and yet it's neglected all the
01:24:32.48 --> 01:24:40.32 time because I think oh I already know what Dave is going to say so I'm just gonna bud in and start to tell
01:24:40.32 --> 01:24:48.000 what I think well I am disrespecting Dave contrary if Dave is talking and I listen to him and I
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.84 nod my head and say up I hear what you're saying and I let him complete his thoughts not only am I not
01:24:53.84 --> 01:25:01.92 disrespecting him I am respecting him and damn if you don't see some just mayhem go watch the news
01:25:02.80 --> 01:25:09.28 it's insanity it's total insanity not just the news casters themselves or the guests that they
01:25:09.28 --> 01:25:14.96 have come on for three minutes to yell at each other but go watch some you know two people in this
01:25:14.96 --> 01:25:20.000 day and age or five people or a hundred people arguing with each other no one's listening anybody
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:26.40 why jump into that bar fight right this is a verbal bar fight which I obviously can escalate into
01:25:26.40 --> 01:25:31.04 real fights and real problems nowadays we're seeing all kinds of mayhem out in streets and that
01:25:31.04 --> 01:25:35.68 mayhem is being caused by the fact that no one's listening to each other and it starts with the
01:25:35.68 --> 01:25:41.60 disrespect if I'm not going to listen to you and by the way when you when I cut you off and then
01:25:41.60 --> 01:25:48.48 you try and cut me off back what's my response I get louder and then you get louder and now we're
01:25:48.48 --> 01:25:51.12 escalating next thing you know we're from one punch next thing you know we're having
01:25:51.12 --> 01:25:55.52 hooking bottles and bricks and shooting tear gas and we got a real freaking problem
01:25:57.52 --> 01:26:04.32 because we don't listen to each other yeah a lot of times though when when I witness that
01:26:04.32 --> 01:26:10.96 or see it or whatever I think anyway comes not necessarily overtly disrespect but it's almost
01:26:10.96 --> 01:26:16.72 like an absence of respect because more like they're just distracted or maybe just focused on their
01:26:16.72 --> 01:26:23.04 own like what they have to say or their own significance or whatever right so how you said yeah
01:26:23.04 --> 01:26:27.20 because if I think I know what Dave's going to say I'm going to cut him off and that's true
01:26:27.20 --> 01:26:31.36 and even if it's subconscious it's true you know because if I don't know what you're going to say
01:26:31.36 --> 01:26:36.24 and I'm like kind of curious I'm going to I'm going to wait to hear it you know but a lot of times
01:26:36.24 --> 01:26:42.56 people they're either think they know what they're going to say or they're too eager about what
01:26:42.56 --> 01:26:46.96 they want to say right so it kind of a lot of times it comes back to like what kind of person you
01:26:46.96 --> 01:26:51.44 are you know so if you're like hey everything that comes out of my mouth is just go
01:26:53.04 --> 01:26:59.60 you'll probably interrupt people more like I tend to see that kind of pattern you know for sure
01:27:00.40 --> 01:27:07.60 and there's I will say the main time when I jump in on somebody is like I've got something
01:27:07.60 --> 01:27:12.80 flashing through my brain and I don't want to lose it yeah you don't want to forget it there is that
01:27:12.80 --> 01:27:20.80 to you and yeah that actually seems like a legitimate like reason to interrupt sometimes yeah
01:27:21.52 --> 01:27:24.48 but it's one of those things and I think like you said a couple times or it's like oh yeah
01:27:24.48 --> 01:27:28.32 it might must not have been that important or whatever you know if you forget it but here's the
01:27:28.32 --> 01:27:33.60 thing though there's a little dichotomy on that one too what if Dave's over here talking like so much
01:27:33.60 --> 01:27:37.68 he said so many things that reached like straightaway acquired me and interrupt me like hey I
01:27:37.68 --> 01:27:41.36 got to stop you there you know like that kind or it's like hey that's not I got to stop you there you
01:27:41.36 --> 01:27:48.40 know kind of thing but I didn't I just let him go meanwhile he left me with 47 things that
01:27:48.40 --> 01:27:53.68 require my rebuttal or whatever and I didn't interrupt them it's kind of like yeah that's a challenge
01:27:53.68 --> 01:27:59.76 yeah but at the end of the day big picture you might as well just be like well at least I listen
01:27:59.76 --> 01:28:04.40 to Dave and everything yet to say yeah I mean obviously we could break down sort of break down the
01:28:04.40 --> 01:28:09.68 social dynamics of situations where you know you'll find some disagreement with you now I will
01:28:09.68 --> 01:28:15.20 tell you I am much better off if Dave is saying something that I disagree with I am much better off
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:22.24 most of the time letting him say what it is that I disagree with rather than just jumping in and being like
01:28:22.24 --> 01:28:26.64 that that look it's it's disrespectful I'm clearly not listening to you
01:28:26.64 --> 01:28:36.000 right I'm cutting you off yeah so why am I behaving that way it's not good look if you
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:42.48 if Dave wants to talk for seven minutes and rattle off you know like you said 47 points
01:28:43.28 --> 01:28:48.56 maybe at some point I go you know maybe at some point I say hey can I just can we can we kind of
01:28:48.56 --> 01:28:52.88 address these things one at a time because you've you've just said three different things and
01:28:52.88 --> 01:28:57.68 I'm gonna I'm gonna get lost in what you're saying and and I want to talk about that first thing
01:28:57.68 --> 01:29:01.92 I think you could do that respectfully yeah like you got to put effort into the respectful part of
01:29:01.92 --> 01:29:06.88 you know like I can respectfully interrupt really but if you're just throwing out interruptions yes
01:29:06.88 --> 01:29:12.80 disrespectful there's certainly different modalities of interruption that are that are
01:29:13.60 --> 01:29:20.32 you know wildly differently from and you know it's cool what's interesting is when you are
01:29:20.32 --> 01:29:25.28 face to face with somebody you can tell when the person wants to say something right you can
01:29:25.28 --> 01:29:29.28 let's look at the face and they get a face and they have a non-verbal communication telling you
01:29:29.28 --> 01:29:33.60 I got something to say right now and if if I'm if Dave's giving me that look
01:29:35.12 --> 01:29:40.96 my my respect to him is to go he's got something to say time to give him a moment
01:29:41.60 --> 01:29:49.44 yeah and the I think well I'm speaking from experience and I don't have much but
01:29:49.44 --> 01:29:54.32 well actually no I do have a lot of experience listening to people talk but if you if you
01:29:55.12 --> 01:30:00.48 have a situation where okay the person is talking and they're saying all crazy stuff right
01:30:00.48 --> 01:30:05.12 that kind of requires some correction or some interruption right or some discussion at
01:30:05.12 --> 01:30:10.40 an minimum yeah so unless you guys are actively working on solving a specific problem we can
01:30:10.40 --> 01:30:13.60 which can happen like in work or in a family or whatever but you know how some people they just
01:30:13.60 --> 01:30:17.20 like to talk and we're just having a friend and conversation whatever and they're just
01:30:17.20 --> 01:30:21.92 blabbing at the same things that are just some are true some are not true and they're just going
01:30:21.92 --> 01:30:27.12 on and on like they're all all correct right and then won't be quite you might as well just not
01:30:27.12 --> 01:30:33.12 say anything because at the end of the day it it does you better to just listen to everything they
01:30:33.12 --> 01:30:36.64 said and you know you know what you know the old saying like yeah you don't want to talk
01:30:36.64 --> 01:30:40.40 you want to listen because now you know everything you already know and then you know what they
01:30:40.40 --> 01:30:45.76 know kind of thing you're with them yeah that's that's from this podcast as a matter of fact
01:30:45.76 --> 01:30:50.96 oh there you go boom so so it's like that kind of situation you know like you're not you're not
01:30:50.96 --> 01:30:57.76 tasked necessarily to to effectively change someone's mind every single time so you might as well
01:30:57.76 --> 01:31:01.84 just keep your mouth shut a lot of the time I mean let's face it if you're going to have a
01:31:01.84 --> 01:31:08.80 discussion with someone to try and try and consolidate your ideas together to become to come up
01:31:08.80 --> 01:31:14.88 with a the strongest idea then you have to converse with them and whether there are subordinate
01:31:14.88 --> 01:31:22.32 or a superior or a peer at some point you know in order to progress ideas you have to
01:31:22.32 --> 01:31:27.04 converse with them and just sitting there and remaining silent when people are saying things that
01:31:27.04 --> 01:31:32.72 you totally disagree with or to put in a better way you don't fully understand their perspective
01:31:33.76 --> 01:31:39.76 then we have to uncover that perspective a little bit and you do that by asking questions and
01:31:39.76 --> 01:31:46.000 trying to figure out where they are coming from yeah you know I'm totally recalling of
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.92 very specific situation recently whereas the middle of this straight up argument debate
01:31:51.92 --> 01:31:57.68 social situation about political causes I political things and I just witness just may
01:31:57.68 --> 01:32:02.64 I'm going back and forth I'm saying anything yeah that's just jumping into a bar fight that
01:32:02.64 --> 01:32:08.56 you're not but I'm thinking like hey either one of you guys could easily just be quiet and
01:32:08.56 --> 01:32:13.68 listen and not saying anything for the rest of the whole time or whatever and this whole like
01:32:14.56 --> 01:32:20.24 we'd all be better off it's kind of like one of those situations so I'm totally projecting that right
01:32:20.24 --> 01:32:31.12 now until this situation what are you writing down there do there's a lot there's a lot and what you just said
01:32:31.12 --> 01:32:37.92 you're thinking you're just talking about when you're sitting there watching these other two people
01:32:37.92 --> 01:32:41.36 and when you're watching these other two people have like what is kind of like a ridiculous
01:32:41.36 --> 01:32:45.76 conversation with an arguing you're just sort of the news or whatever and we're all just sitting
01:32:45.76 --> 01:32:50.72 there as observers and it looks completely ridiculous to us as observers you see it escalating
01:32:50.72 --> 01:32:56.000 you see it going nowhere you see people digging in and when you're just watching it it's obvious
01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:03.68 how completely ridiculous it is the comment earlier is like that feeling that when we have something to say
01:33:04.40 --> 01:33:09.52 it's different and this needs to be said remember that when you're about to open your mouth somebody
01:33:09.52 --> 01:33:14.96 else is going to watch it and you're going to look every bit is ridiculous to them as they did to you
01:33:16.96 --> 01:33:22.88 when you're talking about listening and I have learned this in my life I have learned to have a bias
01:33:22.88 --> 01:33:27.44 to not talk I learned that skill wasn't born with that skill I don't think anybody would
01:33:27.44 --> 01:33:32.24 accuse 20-year-old Dave of having a bias for listening that's a learned thing that I have
01:33:32.80 --> 01:33:38.96 done in my life the trick there is what you have said a thousand times is you actually have to
01:33:38.96 --> 01:33:43.92 listen because of what you said before just if I'm talking and you're letting me talk and I think
01:33:43.92 --> 01:33:49.28 you're listening to me I'll talk I'll keep doing with you but the second I catch you the
01:33:49.28 --> 01:33:53.84 I roll at the heavy breeze or whatever you're going to do and like do this guys listen into me
01:33:55.52 --> 01:34:01.28 you actually have to listen and the only way you will truly listen to what the other person says
01:34:01.28 --> 01:34:05.68 is if in your mind you believe that you might get something out of it because if you think you're like
01:34:05.68 --> 01:34:11.20 I'll do it here goes echo he's going to just go do what he does and it's going to be a complete waste of time
01:34:11.20 --> 01:34:19.52 the minute I do that I'm going to miss something and the actual listening part is a lot harder than
01:34:19.52 --> 01:34:23.76 it sounds because the conversation you're having your head which is I know I'm right all these
01:34:23.76 --> 01:34:27.76 points are wrong all these things are saying you're just complete waste the active listening piece
01:34:27.76 --> 01:34:31.44 better come from a place of authenticity or you need to get found out in a second because your
01:34:31.44 --> 01:34:34.48 body language is going to give the whole thing away and then you might as well just come off right
01:34:34.48 --> 01:34:39.76 there because they're not listening because he knows you're not listening to me yeah there's a
01:34:39.76 --> 01:34:44.64 lot with that and it symbols it sounds to listen if it was so easy wouldn't have to say it
01:34:44.64 --> 01:34:51.04 over again you're all fighting the urge like to yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
01:34:51.04 --> 01:34:59.92 check a little section to hear about just just foratization with the prisoners
01:35:00.72 --> 01:35:06.56 and and that they could not do that which is the reason the reason I said that is because
01:35:06.56 --> 01:35:11.60 here are these guys are trying to kill you for me this is just shows you the
01:35:13.60 --> 01:35:21.44 the predominant spirit spirit of the American servicemen it says here it was necessary
01:35:21.44 --> 01:35:25.68 repeatedly to warn the troops against incorrect practice of fratizing with prisoners and
01:35:25.68 --> 01:35:29.76 giving them cigarettes which interfered with the proper interrogation troops had to be warned
01:35:29.76 --> 01:35:34.64 not to remove paybooks from the prisoners because these books furnished a check to the interrogation
01:35:34.64 --> 01:35:39.20 officer of the prisoner's statements in regard to his organization previous service so there's just
01:35:39.20 --> 01:35:44.48 these you wouldn't think that after these guys are trying to kill you that you'd want to
01:35:44.48 --> 01:35:59.52 give them a cigarette right and yet respect speed marching commanding general third division
01:35:59.52 --> 01:36:04.96 Sicily the importance of physical condition cannot be over emphasized speed marching proved of
01:36:04.96 --> 01:36:09.68 great value in developing physical condition eliminating the unfit and instilling confidence
01:36:09.68 --> 01:36:17.20 impride in the individual as a general training objective all units prepared for landing on
01:36:17.20 --> 01:36:23.04 defended beaches and an advance inland of about five miles speed marching continued each unit
01:36:23.04 --> 01:36:28.72 being required to complete five miles in one hour eight miles in two hours and 20 miles in five hours
01:36:28.72 --> 01:36:34.56 once a week this training was largely responsible for the speed with which the assault of this
01:36:34.56 --> 01:36:46.64 division was executed there you go physical conditioning it he points out this and this is so obvious
01:36:48.40 --> 01:36:56.64 instilling confidence impride mean what a factor what a factor who ate the warrior kid books you know
01:36:56.64 --> 01:37:03.04 get a kid that doesn't will can't do a pull-up right and also you can do a pull-up you can lift your own
01:37:03.04 --> 01:37:09.84 weight you can stand up a little straighter and get your team working out to what I'm saying
01:37:12.88 --> 01:37:18.08 writing messages reports and messages major Robert Wilson field artillery
01:37:18.80 --> 01:37:24.88 Italy the who what when where and why we're often not contained in reports both oral and written
01:37:24.88 --> 01:37:29.28 battalion regimental s-tos and the men themselves indicated that during maneuvers and in training
01:37:29.28 --> 01:37:33.84 problems they had thought that this subject had been mastered but that in combat it was ignored
01:37:33.84 --> 01:37:39.76 or forgotten as to clarity the axiom of a message can be understood it will be missed if a message
01:37:39.76 --> 01:37:46.48 can be misunderstood it will be misunderstood was well proven the comment here writing messages during
01:37:46.48 --> 01:37:53.60 a unit training program is one thing writing clear specifically worded messages and orders
01:37:53.60 --> 01:37:59.20 under combat conditions is quite another theoretical training and message writing must be
01:37:59.20 --> 01:38:08.000 supplemented by constant practice and supervision in the field that why I was an English major
01:38:08.40 --> 01:38:16.88 so I could learn how to write section here on dirt breeding infection half the
01:38:16.88 --> 01:38:23.12 vacuations from the battalion was due to infection caused by minor scratches and to that I would say
01:38:23.12 --> 01:38:31.68 I'd get yourself some warrior kid sop so you could stay oh come on this is another one of those
01:38:31.68 --> 01:38:38.48 life ones a fox hole in time saves lives lieutenant crawl bowguard infantry fifth army Italy
01:38:39.52 --> 01:38:45.84 although the average american soldier will dig a fox hole or slit trench when the artillery or
01:38:45.84 --> 01:38:52.32 mortar shells are falling in his vicinity only a few of those I saw would dig them
01:38:52.32 --> 01:39:00.16 prior to that time when they did dig them they were usually quite shallow it was always very easy
01:39:00.16 --> 01:39:05.12 to tell a German fox hole from the american the former were always much deeper many casualties
01:39:05.12 --> 01:39:10.24 occurred from shell fire which I believe would have been avoided had proper fox holes or slit trench
01:39:10.24 --> 01:39:17.12 been dug in and this is you know the code the evaluation of protocol are you prepared for life
01:39:17.12 --> 01:39:25.44 emergencies are you prepared for emergency situations we as americans I totally agree with this we don't
01:39:25.44 --> 01:39:29.84 like to worry about anything until it slaps us in the face in fact in the seal teams I used to tell
01:39:29.84 --> 01:39:34.24 my leadership no one worries about anything until they get slapped in the face with it like no one's
01:39:34.24 --> 01:39:37.28 really concerned about that until you get hit with it and all of a sudden you got to execute that
01:39:37.28 --> 01:39:41.76 mission and you're not the gear that you need so let's get the gear we need let's get do the rehearsals
01:39:41.76 --> 01:39:50.96 we're supposed to do be proactive I can kind of go for little things to over 100% goes to little
01:39:50.96 --> 01:39:55.60 things but well yeah so these and these little things can kind of get sold the other night
01:39:56.40 --> 01:40:00.32 metal it's bedtime we'll go sleep right in the middle of the night here
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:08.32 you know what that is right no idea your uh permanent security or a fire detector with a nine
01:40:08.32 --> 01:40:13.68 volt battery that's dead that's dying exactly right and brought you inside you think you can if you don't
01:40:13.68 --> 01:40:21.28 have nine volt batteries at what three a m and nowhere they are and nowhere they are yeah but listen you
01:40:21.28 --> 01:40:25.76 don't have them straight up I mean let's face it did you just have random nine volt batteries in your
01:40:25.76 --> 01:40:31.04 in your house yes I know exactly where they are so have to do for each fire detector in my house
01:40:31.04 --> 01:40:37.36 here's the thing I may father now so so do I oh yeah so do I but I'll tell you this before I had
01:40:37.36 --> 01:40:46.08 kids before I had a thing life whatever that's my protection I didn't have nine volt batteries
01:40:46.08 --> 01:40:50.48 just hanging around straight up didn't have didn't even think about it years oh yeah 100% I
01:40:50.48 --> 01:40:55.92 guess my wife when she was growing up they they didn't have batteries like you know the
01:40:55.92 --> 01:41:01.52 her mom and dad just batteries weren't on the list yeah and so my wife is a battery a
01:41:01.52 --> 01:41:08.000 horror and stockpiler you want a nine volt you want a triple A double A what do you want C.C.
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.20 open up that cabinet they're in there they're ready for I'm with you my wife the exact same
01:41:13.20 --> 01:41:16.96 she gets a little bit excited when the batteries run out on something she gets a little bit
01:41:16.96 --> 01:41:22.88 you know it's like hey the batteries out on this thing hold on and she goes and digs out of
01:41:22.88 --> 01:41:31.20 C.E.2.3.2.5 for my watch actually I think my watch is F.32.32 yeah this was gonna say
01:41:31.20 --> 01:41:36.08 that's the C.3 that one's I think that's a scale you put that in one of those little scales
01:41:36.08 --> 01:41:41.04 it might be that well I don't know either way yeah I don't know either but I do know that I did
01:41:41.04 --> 01:41:45.68 have a nine volt battery that night but I was thinking to myself probably what if I didn't have a nine
01:41:45.68 --> 01:41:50.56 volt battery right no we're not sleeping tonight you're only you're not sleeping then that and it
01:41:50.56 --> 01:41:53.92 doesn't have to do just that night now you got the whole next day you got to contend with
01:41:53.92 --> 01:42:00.56 you seem saying I'm really very this is your paranoid no a fire or that beep is bothering you the
01:42:00.56 --> 01:42:06.48 beep is gonna keep you up I'm with you man that's that's the kiss kiss I'll tell you what happens
01:42:06.48 --> 01:42:13.84 it turns out that that fire detector that beeps every 60 seconds can't be destroyed yeah you could
01:42:13.84 --> 01:42:18.72 take a sledgehammer to it and just breaking it without it will still beep so when you're talking
01:42:18.72 --> 01:42:22.56 about that's the slap in the face which is a totally unprepared for the situation now you're up
01:42:22.56 --> 01:42:26.64 all night you think you solve the problem the second you get in the bed lights out covers
01:42:27.68 --> 01:42:33.84 babe I got a sort beep and then you're up again some with you that's true I learned this lesson
01:42:35.28 --> 01:42:40.88 30 years ago so I've got those nine volts at the ready yes sir yeah and in one time you know how I found
01:42:40.88 --> 01:42:45.76 that out that you can't you can't stop that thing I was like okay I was a gas no problem like I'll
01:42:45.76 --> 01:42:50.48 just take out the battery how can I beep with no power simply can't be it can't happen so like
01:42:50.48 --> 01:42:55.84 you know where's it get the power to beep from where does that come from apparently they thought
01:42:55.84 --> 01:42:59.92 ahead you know in the case of a really emergency it's one of those things and a little bit more
01:42:59.92 --> 01:43:03.76 important then you're sweet that night if you're unprepared you know so it made sense when I
01:43:03.76 --> 01:43:07.92 kind of thought through it but nonetheless I'll still face with this problem like this beeping
01:43:07.92 --> 01:43:11.36 lucky it wasn't in the middle of the night but whatever so I said yeah I got a job I
01:43:13.20 --> 01:43:18.24 would have a real problem that day but I had to put it in the drawer you could still hear but it was
01:43:18.24 --> 01:43:24.16 just way way more quiet so any got a battery whatever later on yeah I can't be disabled that's
01:43:24.16 --> 01:43:29.28 the whole reason if it's not a disaster I cannot can't be far from doing it for you there but yeah
01:43:29.28 --> 01:43:34.000 man nonetheless that's the point it can go for small things too seems saying they'd probably just
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:39.52 be prepared how about this how about just keep some nine volt batteries oh good probably three
01:43:39.52 --> 01:43:45.44 m three p.m whenever you go oh better it's better you slow you know we good over there I
01:43:45.44 --> 01:43:52.40 click turn also with that alright let's move on section three mountain operations they go through a big
01:43:52.40 --> 01:43:58.000 batang in attack here going to a lot of detail it's another another from another perspective on the
01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:06.000 battle on the atto island and there's there's some detail there's some maps and charts and you
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.92 should go check it out online so you can kind of get the full benefit of that but I just wanted to hit a
01:44:09.92 --> 01:44:14.24 couple highlights and we're going back to communications here a rather elaborate system of communications
01:44:14.24 --> 01:44:20.88 was established to enable the batang commander to control the fire of supporting weapons in further
01:44:20.88 --> 01:44:26.96 instead of tactical plans the artillery radar radio as well as telephone was set up at the batang
01:44:26.96 --> 01:44:32.72 commanders OP on top of the hogback which is one of these little terrain features a sound power
01:44:32.72 --> 01:44:38.56 telephone was run from the mortar OP back to the batang commander likewise one from the 75's the
01:44:38.56 --> 01:44:45.04 telephone was also run from the OP to the officer in charge of all 37 millimeter firing radio and
01:44:45.04 --> 01:44:52.72 telephone control was run to all companies in the batang so the reason I highlight that that's a lot of
01:44:52.72 --> 01:45:01.84 communications and if we're counting on all those communications we may not get what we might not get what we want
01:45:01.84 --> 01:45:09.92 goes into this here they get into contact we saw the first one at 0 4 30 in the morning he was
01:45:09.92 --> 01:45:14.64 a centering we were then 50 yards of him he stood up against the skyline it was shaking out a
01:45:14.64 --> 01:45:21.68 grass mat lieutenant brown motion to us to get up a little under the ledge to our front and then he shot
01:45:21.68 --> 01:45:26.40 the jab the shot must have awakened others as we worked up over the ledge a jab machine
01:45:26.40 --> 01:45:32.000 gunner began firing at us we stayed down until the first excited burst had gone over then we raised
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.88 up and returned fire several jabs had holes near the edge of the ledge we were under and they
01:45:36.88 --> 01:45:41.68 began to throw grenades over but the hill below is so steep that most of the grenades rolled down
01:45:41.68 --> 01:45:48.08 and exploded out of range below us the machine gun was firing again but several of our men were close
01:45:48.08 --> 01:45:53.84 enough to to the ledge to lob grenades over the machine gun itself was out of grenade range
01:45:53.84 --> 01:46:05.84 but some of the jabs near the edge caught hell from the grenades are you feeling lucky when the
01:46:05.84 --> 01:46:10.08 people that are throwing grenades at you they like bounce over your position and don't hurt you I
01:46:10.08 --> 01:46:15.36 think that might have been my whole point there the radio fails so this is why I get concerned about
01:46:17.12 --> 01:46:23.12 about communications and as a former radio minute definitely freaks me out lieutenant brown try to
01:46:23.12 --> 01:46:27.52 again and again to contact battalion headquarters or the artillery and I'm fast forwarding a little bit
01:46:27.52 --> 01:46:32.40 or the artillery with the radio but the set refused to function the radio man worked with it and
01:46:32.40 --> 01:46:36.40 tried again but failed the button was reorganizing we started up again they're assaulting the
01:46:36.40 --> 01:46:42.64 hill we got as high as the ledge once more and had started over the top on the table above
01:46:42.64 --> 01:46:47.52 when the jab opened up with machine guns again we needed artillery and needed it bad every time
01:46:47.52 --> 01:46:52.88 we stuck our noses up a hail storm of bullets cracked across them the radio man was trying
01:46:52.88 --> 01:46:58.16 frantically to contact anybody in the valley below us but the set remained silent several men had
01:46:58.16 --> 01:47:03.04 crawled around to the left and through grenades at the jabs near the edge of the table but the
01:47:03.76 --> 01:47:09.20 machine guns remained out of range our men were driven back to the cover of the ledge with several
01:47:09.20 --> 01:47:15.52 wounds artillery if we only had artillery we could observe the fire we knew where the guns were
01:47:15.52 --> 01:47:20.48 if we could only get some fire we'd walk over the damn mountains the radio man was desperate
01:47:20.48 --> 01:47:30.48 he tried to set again but it was silent in a rage he threw it down the hill yeah so there's a
01:47:30.48 --> 01:47:34.24 bunch of things to think about there just you know your communications cannot be relied upon
01:47:35.12 --> 01:47:40.40 you have to have some kind of backup plan and if you're if you're expecting you can be able to
01:47:41.04 --> 01:47:46.000 make communications when when they're really gonna be needed that is the time they're gonna fail
01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:51.52 that is Murphy's law if you say okay Dave here's gonna happen we have this whole complicated plan and then when you get to
01:47:51.52 --> 01:47:59.20 this point radio me and that's when we'll execute that radio call has a 4% chance of making
01:47:59.20 --> 01:48:07.04 communications if everything hinges upon one call the weight of that hinge just just has
01:48:07.04 --> 01:48:16.16 carmatic is that a word a carmic carmic impact on that communication system and it's not going to work great so
01:48:18.56 --> 01:48:25.36 their attack gets repulsed he says he said we heard the guns in a valley begin firing the attack
01:48:25.36 --> 01:48:29.84 was on we had failed and we felt bad about it bad that they had the drop on us they go into the main attack
01:48:32.16 --> 01:48:36.16 the japs were holding the pass on the high ground on both sides in the front two the ones on the
01:48:36.16 --> 01:48:41.84 right could fire into the backs the attackers of the left and vice versa it was rough going
01:48:42.40 --> 01:48:48.16 lieutenant clevsie got me up and we went around the second section to get them started up
01:48:48.16 --> 01:48:53.12 hill the attack was going okay but it was an awfully tough one bullets were flying all over the
01:48:53.12 --> 01:48:58.80 hillside just up hill from the second section was a jab 37 millimeter we had watched them fire
01:48:58.80 --> 01:49:03.60 from that position several days before and we knew there were japs in that trench the main attack
01:49:03.60 --> 01:49:08.000 was moving around to the left as we started up the hill finally the fire got so heavy that the
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:13.92 machine gun squad took cover in a little draw until we grenade the trench above us to clean it out
01:49:16.08 --> 01:49:22.88 then they were to come on up sergeant tom kovic private first class William Marshall and I started
01:49:22.88 --> 01:49:28.48 up with lieutenant clevsie we had crawled on our bellies to within 25 yards of the trench
01:49:28.48 --> 01:49:33.12 when a sniper raised up and shot Marshall in the air we shot at the sniper we threw grenades into
01:49:33.12 --> 01:49:38.32 the trench we crawled up rapidly then ready to move in behind our grenades and another sniper
01:49:38.32 --> 01:49:43.44 poppies head up out of the hole just above us lieutenant clevsie fired his car being just as the
01:49:43.44 --> 01:49:49.44 jab fire lieutenant toppled over a little bank and lay still he was dead I was just bringing up the
01:49:49.44 --> 01:49:55.28 rifle as the jab my rifle as the jab ducked then from across the valley the jab spotted us
01:49:55.28 --> 01:50:00.80 and they gave us hell machine guns rifles in 37 millimeter began pounding the area finally the
01:50:00.80 --> 01:50:05.60 intense shelling slowed down and we dashed for the open end of the jab trench we had grenadeed
01:50:05.60 --> 01:50:09.68 the trench led around to the point of the hill we crawled down the trench and found where the
01:50:09.68 --> 01:50:15.12 japs were located when we stuck our heads right up in the face of a burst of machine gun fire
01:50:15.12 --> 01:50:20.24 some men from company f had come over to help us but we're stymied we couldn't raise up long enough
01:50:20.24 --> 01:50:24.32 to fire we couldn't get close enough to throw grenades finally we decided to see if we could
01:50:24.32 --> 01:50:30.72 get some mortar fire on the position in some way corporal outford hayman started back up
01:50:30.72 --> 01:50:36.08 to check on the mortar possibilities and while we waited and rested the jab position was slightly
01:50:36.08 --> 01:50:41.12 below us and about a hundred yards further into the pass they were firing almost constantly at
01:50:41.12 --> 01:50:46.72 the troops we could see moving out in the valley and on the opposite side of the pass we were quite
01:50:46.72 --> 01:50:51.52 high up on the side of cold mountain after nearly two hours of lying in the trench and waiting
01:50:51.52 --> 01:50:58.32 we heard one of the men behind holler here he men up here he men and a man from company h the
01:50:58.32 --> 01:51:03.92 infantry were crawling up along the little ravine laying wire they had found a company h mortar
01:51:03.92 --> 01:51:08.16 and had a line right to it the big fight up on the mountain had almost gotten to the top
01:51:08.16 --> 01:51:13.92 but the forces across the pass were getting hell from the guns below us we got the phone all set
01:51:13.92 --> 01:51:19.68 up and carefully poked a little dirt a little hole in the dirt side of the trench a week so that
01:51:19.68 --> 01:51:25.12 one man could see the whole jab position below then we called mortar and the fun started
01:51:25.12 --> 01:51:29.84 we were only about a hundred yards from where the shells were striking in the ground shook
01:51:29.84 --> 01:51:34.56 they fired several rounds close and then they began to drop right in the position finally we called
01:51:35.12 --> 01:51:39.20 and told them we were moving in and not to fire the position was like a big wheel
01:51:39.20 --> 01:51:44.24 was a big wheel like a fair with holes all around it and the spokes connecting the trenches
01:51:44.24 --> 01:51:49.84 with a big center installation in the hub two Japanese machine guns in the 37 millimeter
01:51:49.84 --> 01:51:55.36 that had fired at us during the previous week were captured and destroyed there we tossed six dead
01:51:55.36 --> 01:52:02.24 japs out the hole and brought them brought up our guns up and set them in the jap holes we there we
01:52:02.24 --> 01:52:08.96 sat that night just daring the little so and so has to come up man what positions they had
01:52:08.96 --> 01:52:27.20 one little fight with in a battle you know one little tiny fight with in a battle and
01:52:27.20 --> 01:52:31.68 think of all those decisions that got made and all those actions that took place in the
01:52:31.68 --> 01:52:37.36 mistakes that had to be covered for and the initiative that had to be shown and the bravery
01:52:37.36 --> 01:52:46.48 and the courage I mean it's just it's leadership that's that's what it is it's leadership
01:52:49.04 --> 01:52:58.72 they they go through a bunch of this information continuing on they there's another group
01:52:58.72 --> 01:53:00.96 that takes another point and and again
01:53:00.96 --> 01:53:09.44 look these guys I can pretty much guarantee are no longer alive but this is these are quotes
01:53:09.44 --> 01:53:17.20 these are what these guys are saying happened you know things like lieutenant wallsack
01:53:18.08 --> 01:53:21.60 saying check your bayonets as they get ready to do this assault
01:53:21.60 --> 01:53:30.96 and there's just so there's some some other little battles within fights within battles that
01:53:30.96 --> 01:53:38.24 they cover and then it gets into this comment section these accounts bring out some of the
01:53:38.24 --> 01:53:44.56 characteristics of mountain warfare in which success depends more upon proper adaptation of
01:53:44.56 --> 01:53:52.16 available means to the terrain then upon their power so the way you adapt is more important
01:53:54.40 --> 01:54:01.36 they continue maneuver of small units and the initiative and leadership of subordinate
01:54:01.36 --> 01:54:09.76 commanders are of the highest importance in mountain warfare the actions of small semi-independent
01:54:09.76 --> 01:54:17.28 units in seizing or defending heights and or in fighting to seize or block passes become of
01:54:17.28 --> 01:54:26.000 increasing importance so once again even though this book starts off with the extreme dichotomy
01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:33.76 of discipline of following orders it comes back always to decentralize command an individual
01:54:33.76 --> 01:54:43.12 initiative by subordinate leaders to make things happen he's talking about mountain warfare there
01:54:43.12 --> 01:54:48.88 and and getting to this idea of I mean that's it that's leadership right it's leadership is
01:54:48.88 --> 01:54:55.52 going to be the deciding factor here because the terrain is so it's so impossible to predict there's
01:54:55.52 --> 01:55:00.16 so many different things in places and outcropping it all these different and even tell the story
01:55:00.16 --> 01:55:06.56 what great position they had in that previous example with the Japanese life is more like a mountain
01:55:06.56 --> 01:55:10.80 warfare than it is going to be these big open fields if your life can just reveal themselves and
01:55:10.80 --> 01:55:15.84 just going to plan your your move down down the road there are so many things that are popping
01:55:15.84 --> 01:55:22.08 up when we're talking to companies right now they're describing that same terrain in their business
01:55:22.08 --> 01:55:28.48 lives of all these unproductive and unexpected things and it isn't the strength of their brand
01:55:28.48 --> 01:55:32.32 and it isn't you know the quality it's the leadership that's navigating these companies through
01:55:32.32 --> 01:55:40.96 when we're talking about the terrain of mountain warfare that's what life is it's not just this
01:55:40.96 --> 01:55:45.20 easy straight road from A to B you're just marched down and everything is it's clean
01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:51.44 and how crazy that has to be that at every single turn something comes up and the tool that
01:55:51.44 --> 01:55:56.56 you the only tool that you have to get past that is leadership and you know what I like
01:55:56.56 --> 01:56:04.56 also about this analogy and the way it ties into the entire concept of yes of leadership but
01:56:04.56 --> 01:56:11.12 really even more specifically to ownership and extreme ownership and and that is this this is
01:56:11.12 --> 01:56:21.28 what's so beautiful about this you can't move those mountains you cannot do you cannot those
01:56:21.28 --> 01:56:25.76 mountains are what they are and that's what that's what what triggered that fought my mind was you
01:56:25.76 --> 01:56:32.000 said there's all these variables but what's interesting is you're looking at them you know for
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:37.12 days you understand you can see it on the map you can look at it there's this mountain and you know what
01:56:38.48 --> 01:56:43.92 you can't move that mountain and what you have to do is you have to move yourself and this is
01:56:43.92 --> 01:56:48.80 you know we talk about this in GG2 and someone's across the side on you I can bench press you
01:56:48.80 --> 01:56:53.92 uninch you know maybe two inches I don't care if you have a 500 pound bench press when you've
01:56:53.92 --> 01:57:00.24 got a person that's mobile and they're they're securing you and they've got your chest compress
01:57:00.24 --> 01:57:06.56 but you can't bench press them off of you you can move them just enough then you have to move
01:57:06.56 --> 01:57:13.20 it's incumbent upon you and so we can't move mountains what we have to do is adapt what we have to
01:57:13.20 --> 01:57:19.20 figure out how to utilize us things and what the important thing is even though we can't move
01:57:19.20 --> 01:57:26.16 those mountains the person that figures out how to utilize that terrain is the one that's going to win
01:57:27.20 --> 01:57:32.56 you utilize the terrain it's something that I have no control over but I control how I interact
01:57:32.56 --> 01:57:36.40 with that mountain and I know where I need to be and I know I understand the angles and I understand
01:57:36.40 --> 01:57:41.12 what ravine will give me cover and I understand where it exposes me well even he's talking about hey
01:57:41.12 --> 01:57:46.88 this the way the Japanese were set up and was like oh they can hit these guys here in the
01:57:46.88 --> 01:57:50.80 flank and they can shoot these guys in the back that's the position that they have that's a freaking
01:57:50.80 --> 01:57:58.72 horrible situation to be rolling into horrible situation to be rolling into so when you look at things
01:57:59.04 --> 01:58:04.000 instead of sitting there and going saying I wish the market was different I wish the competitor
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:10.56 would do something different I wish my employees would act in a different way these are all things
01:58:10.56 --> 01:58:14.000 that you can look at you can wish all day long just like you can wish that mountain moves but
01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:19.84 that mountain's not going anywhere so you need to maneuver you need to take ownership of that
01:58:19.84 --> 01:58:30.000 situation and make things happen there's a whole bunch of sections here engineer operations tanks
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:39.36 infantry notes and jungle operations one one section here Japanese centers of resistance were bypassed
01:58:39.36 --> 01:58:47.92 and isolated again how often do we say oh Dave doesn't like this part of my plan so I'm going to
01:58:47.92 --> 01:58:51.68 attack him on that instead of saying okay Dave's going to dig in right there cool I'm going to
01:58:51.68 --> 01:58:56.64 maneuver around it right bypass I'm going to start thinking about that a little bit more often
01:58:56.64 --> 01:58:59.76 in my daily life well how can I bypass maybe not when it comes to working out because echo
01:58:59.76 --> 01:59:05.44 Charles pointed out that might not be the best plan but if it's things that I don't want to engage in
01:59:05.44 --> 01:59:10.000 why am I engaging in them if I don't have to if I can isolate and bypass and not make it part of my
01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:21.52 gig that's fine frontal attacks were uniformly successful when assisted by a flank attack
01:59:23.60 --> 01:59:28.24 on many occasions the flank attack preceded the frontal attack coming into Japanese positions
01:59:28.24 --> 01:59:33.04 from the rear and completely disrupting their defense plans and almost all cases the maneuver
01:59:33.04 --> 01:59:40.16 used by units of all sizes from division to squad was the development of one or both flanks
01:59:40.16 --> 01:59:45.36 yeah resistance was made by resistance was bypassed encircled and reduced later
01:59:46.40 --> 01:59:50.56 so the frontal assault works when it's not actually a frontal assault that's awesome
01:59:50.56 --> 01:59:54.80 frontal assault works when you're doing something else as well yes that's so legit
01:59:54.80 --> 02:00:06.40 section on section on automatic weapons night operations security measures security at night
02:00:06.40 --> 02:00:13.52 lines of communication patrol reports in general the distance covered by the patrols was much less
02:00:13.52 --> 02:00:19.20 than expected of them the difficulties of terrain caused by many patrol leaders to feel that they
02:00:19.20 --> 02:00:23.92 had covered two or three times as much ground than they had actually covered this must be taken
02:00:23.92 --> 02:00:29.84 to account when evaluating patrol reports these are people that think that they know like hey
02:00:29.84 --> 02:00:35.36 I was there in that crazy you could be looking at me totally convinced that you went to
02:00:35.36 --> 02:00:42.96 kilometers and it turns out when we retrace your steps you went whatever 700 yards 700 meters
02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:53.44 one last section to cover here yeah this last section is very interesting
02:00:53.44 --> 02:01:03.04 evacuation methods informal report salomon islands evacuation of casualties was by hand carry
02:01:03.04 --> 02:01:11.20 litter bearers cable litter slings across jungle gollies improvised sleds or drags down steep
02:01:11.20 --> 02:01:18.88 inclines improvised litter racks on quarter ton jeeps small boats on mountain streams or along the
02:01:18.88 --> 02:01:28.000 coast and finally by field ambulances to clearing stations or hospitals how's that for a nightmare
02:01:28.64 --> 02:01:33.44 when you when you were in found did you we ever down pilot yeah yeah did you get carried out on
02:01:33.44 --> 02:01:36.80 the letters yeah you go out in helicopter you stage there and then come on get you like the
02:01:36.80 --> 02:01:42.24 the metal the it's like a metal basket basically the litter did you ever get carried by a seal
02:01:42.24 --> 02:01:48.48 platoon like eight kilometers no okay I know exactly what you're talking about I was never the
02:01:48.48 --> 02:01:54.000 I was never the down air crew that got actually physically pulled right it's not fun when you're
02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:58.000 getting carried because you're getting dropped you're getting slammed you're getting all over the place
02:01:58.64 --> 02:02:02.72 and usually we would stick guys with IVs you know we're like we would try and do some medical training
02:02:02.72 --> 02:02:12.16 on as well but good lord I want you to think about everything that I just said hand carry
02:02:12.16 --> 02:02:18.72 cable litter's across jungle golly's improvise sleds drags down steep so you're wounded
02:02:18.72 --> 02:02:23.20 and what's the method of doing okay we're gonna drag you down a steep incline improvise
02:02:23.20 --> 02:02:29.52 litter on a on a quarter ton jeep imagine that thing bouncing around small boats think about a
02:02:29.52 --> 02:02:35.84 nightmare and this is where you start to realize what a nightmare I'm talking about
02:02:35.84 --> 02:02:44.32 evacuation by litter bears was difficult tiring time consuming and involved distances averaging
02:02:44.32 --> 02:02:52.16 two or three miles and five to six miles in some instances many more litter bears had to be
02:02:52.16 --> 02:02:59.60 utilized than under ordinary conditions litter carry in many cases required as high as
02:02:59.60 --> 02:03:08.80 16 carriers per patient over almost impossible terrain and can be counted as least efficient
02:03:10.48 --> 02:03:16.08 so it takes 16 people to evacuate somebody two miles or three miles
02:03:18.48 --> 02:03:25.04 where evacuation by litter was necessary bearers worked in relays eight or even 16 men accompanying
02:03:25.04 --> 02:03:31.84 each litter leaving one another in litter carry and in cutting narrow paths through the dense jungle
02:03:34.56 --> 02:03:44.32 16 people to move a wounded man I mean that's just crazy and obviously it wasn't all of them but
02:03:44.32 --> 02:03:48.48 they're saying hey sometimes it was eight and I'll tell you the the reason I was asking you if
02:03:48.48 --> 02:03:53.76 you'd ever been in that position number one you get beat up but you know when we would do desert training
02:03:53.76 --> 02:03:58.96 when I was running desert training men those guys would do some down man carries and I'm sure
02:03:58.96 --> 02:04:04.64 some of the guys that are here and we say in that an hour smiling with pleasant memories
02:04:04.64 --> 02:04:11.76 of going eight kilometers through the imperial valley desert carrying and eventually like the
02:04:11.76 --> 02:04:18.16 first you know if we had a troop that hadn't been through before or didn't have any experience say oh yeah
02:04:18.16 --> 02:04:21.52 hey which I'd you know what's your casualty evacuation plan oh we're just gonna put two guys on
02:04:21.52 --> 02:04:25.92 and we're gonna do a forget the name there's a couple carries you know there's a standard fireman's
02:04:25.92 --> 02:04:31.44 carry oh we're just gonna fireman's carry okay cool see how that see how that works out for you
02:04:31.44 --> 02:04:37.36 you can't I mean it's it's you can do it for 100 meters 200 meters 300 meters
02:04:39.76 --> 02:04:47.12 400 meters you're on night vision you're in the worst freaking terrain rocks shale rocks
02:04:47.12 --> 02:04:53.84 all all over the place and it was great because as we would do these drills and as guys realized
02:04:53.84 --> 02:05:01.28 what a traumatic impact it was when you took casualties and how you had to adjust what you
02:05:01.28 --> 02:05:07.20 thought you'd be able to do because you can't just freaking rambo you can rambo somebody up I
02:05:07.20 --> 02:05:11.92 mean I've done it like okay grab a guy and I'm gonna carry 150 meters 200 meters
02:05:11.92 --> 02:05:17.04 by the time you get to that 200 meter mark like you're when you get to the spot you're just
02:05:17.04 --> 02:05:22.64 falling down with the guy 300 meters you're just falling down and you're exhausted and you've lost
02:05:22.64 --> 02:05:28.56 your weapon and your night vision and his gear's gone it's a disaster until you figure out okay
02:05:28.56 --> 02:05:31.52 when this happens here's what here's some procedures that we need to do
02:05:31.52 --> 02:05:42.32 talks about the improvised G bandulence is talks about evacuation by water
02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:52.72 physical fitness the arduous and fatiguing litter carrying demonstrated the need for physical
02:05:52.72 --> 02:05:58.64 fitness on the part of medical department personnel which should correct the impression that
02:05:58.64 --> 02:06:04.88 physically impaired individuals can be utilized throughout medical department activities
02:06:06.96 --> 02:06:11.20 so this idea that you can have a bunch of you know guy that's injured or hurt and have him
02:06:11.20 --> 02:06:19.28 broken in medical being a stretcher bearer is completely and utterly wrong and that's
02:06:20.96 --> 02:06:23.92 well that's a wrap on the highlights that I had from this
02:06:23.92 --> 02:06:31.12 and you know I I don't know when I think about this whole thing and we've been
02:06:31.12 --> 02:06:37.76 referring back to it the whole time that so many good lessons but the the the key take away
02:06:37.76 --> 02:06:44.000 for me is that whole idea of leader versus inertia and you know as soon as I said that
02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.84 today Dave I looked at you and I saw you had about a thousand thoughts going through your mind
02:06:47.84 --> 02:06:53.52 don't want that means and how many ways that we can apply that it's like the world is
02:06:53.52 --> 02:07:04.000 inspiring against us and it's human nature to neglect our duties and I know that sounds
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.40 crazy and sure there's some outliers out there that are proactive and make things happen
02:07:08.40 --> 02:07:15.84 but you've got to assess as a leader that human nature is to be lazy and to be careless and
02:07:15.84 --> 02:07:22.32 you need definitely looking the mirror because it's not always just going to be the people that
02:07:22.32 --> 02:07:31.44 you lead it's going to be you and that section where they talk about the hardest job that you
02:07:31.44 --> 02:07:37.36 have as a leader is getting things done getting things done by people who know that they're
02:07:37.36 --> 02:07:43.68 supposed to do them and even in some cases know that those things are costing in lives failure to
02:07:43.68 --> 02:07:54.16 do things failure to take action so don't allow that be on the lookout how nice is it sometimes
02:07:54.16 --> 02:08:01.68 when you make the connection between something that's there that you've always known was there
02:08:01.68 --> 02:08:07.68 but you never p-i-d it and by that echo I mean positively identified like hey I know now
02:08:07.68 --> 02:08:15.76 everyone that's listening to this today now knows that that's a problem and look we all kind
02:08:15.76 --> 02:08:18.72 of knew it right I mean I talked about a discipline which we didn't feel man way I know
02:08:18.72 --> 02:08:24.08 or walk on a move like that's a real thing I get it we all kind of get it but how about the
02:08:24.08 --> 02:08:29.84 p-i-d on it and now when it starts happening either with you or with your team or with your family
02:08:29.84 --> 02:08:39.52 or with your friends you can p-i-d it and then you can address it properly and you can start with yourself
02:08:39.68 --> 02:08:47.36 you can start by making things happen
02:08:49.92 --> 02:08:57.12 speaking of making things happen echo Charles yes how can we do what we're supposed to do
02:08:57.12 --> 02:09:05.04 well we know we should do on top of p-i-d-ing it we p-i-d it oh yeah yeah something with complaining
02:09:05.04 --> 02:09:10.08 right remember we p-i-d that long time ago complaining uh blaming another one yeah there's
02:09:10.08 --> 02:09:15.60 two those are two good things once you recognize once you p-i-d those things man that blame
02:09:15.60 --> 02:09:21.28 one oh yeah because if you don't p-i-d the blame it'll like sneak in it it's like you're
02:09:21.28 --> 02:09:26.64 gonna wait with it dude really it's clear oh yeah you can be like yeah yeah I really shouldn't have
02:09:26.64 --> 02:09:29.84 done that you know it could have helped you know if you were to game the heads up or whatever but
02:09:29.84 --> 02:09:34.56 you write I shouldn't shouldn't have done that you see the blame like that's stupid mountain was
02:09:34.56 --> 02:09:39.28 totally blocking our position yeah kind of make it makes it kind of harder but no you're
02:09:39.28 --> 02:09:43.20 right I should have done it you same same see me taking ownership but slipping in the blame
02:09:43.20 --> 02:09:48.000 you can see the blame you can see it it's what I'm saying anyway so don't do that
02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:54.64 when you're um working out which okay so I worked out today actually I mean I thought about
02:09:54.64 --> 02:10:00.32 working out today but then I got into this deep conversation with my wife about some important
02:10:00.32 --> 02:10:06.08 stuff the window closed the window totally closed oh it closed it straight up closed yeah
02:10:06.08 --> 02:10:11.44 because the conversation went long I had to come here you see him same yeah I had a window
02:10:11.44 --> 02:10:20.000 closing last night it was I had something my wife was making dinner I was like I can fit in a
02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:26.000 run right now before dinner oh late workout no just a run I already worked out so run is not
02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:33.04 a workout there you are so late night so my wife was cooking dinner I had like a 40 minute window
02:10:33.04 --> 02:10:39.04 my wife says oh by the way someone's coming over to grab something I'm like okay the
02:10:39.04 --> 02:10:43.44 run's not happening now the windows just I'm kind of I'm kind of struggling it off like oh well
02:10:43.44 --> 02:10:49.84 you know we know closed you know but then I PID did and I said you know what I ate dinner which I
02:10:49.84 --> 02:10:54.96 ate I ate dinner and then I ran just and punished myself I pulled one of those before
02:10:54.96 --> 02:10:59.12 brother that's still true right there so that right there well you just did which went what
02:10:59.12 --> 02:11:05.04 you what you experienced same deal right you got the 40 minute window for running right
02:11:05.04 --> 02:11:09.12 because you got it all planned on your head it goes beyond the run it goes like the stuff you did
02:11:09.12 --> 02:11:13.84 before is in your mind stuff you're gonna do after the run dinner all this other stuff and the
02:11:13.84 --> 02:11:19.12 stuff after that in your mind does not include the run because the run is already done that's it that's
02:11:19.12 --> 02:11:23.36 whole formula right there in your mind so now that little window closed boom where is that run
02:11:23.36 --> 02:11:28.16 gonna fit in I already know in my mind what I'm gonna do after dinner which is after the run
02:11:28.16 --> 02:11:32.88 which already happened right when I'm doing put the run there no it's already occupied in your
02:11:32.88 --> 02:11:39.44 brain you see it's in but the thing doesn't work like that you put it there as essentially like an excuse
02:11:39.44 --> 02:11:47.04 yeah you know it's crazy so as I was running so now I'm running 20 minutes after I get done
02:11:47.04 --> 02:11:58.24 you yeah I don't think I've run on a full stomach for 15 years think about that 15 years I don't
02:11:58.24 --> 02:12:02.32 think and I don't think I'll run on a full stomach again for another 15 years because it felt
02:12:02.32 --> 02:12:07.36 very good awful and I don't roll I don't work out on a full stomach I don't like doing any
02:12:07.36 --> 02:12:12.16 that I can get away with like a workout depending on the workout not squatting on a full stomach
02:12:12.16 --> 02:12:16.96 because that's just not good but maybe I can do some pull ups on a full but yeah I was
02:12:17.68 --> 02:12:22.24 running on a full stomach I want to do that again I would next time because I wanted to you know
02:12:22.24 --> 02:12:28.24 like eat with my family you know that like let's eat time I would have eaten one forkful
02:12:28.24 --> 02:12:32.56 of food and not eaten and put it and then go for it's hang with the family go for run
02:12:32.56 --> 02:12:37.28 come back yeah that would be the power move and that's actually one of many power moves really
02:12:37.28 --> 02:12:41.44 the other power move is how about this yeah good for you you know running on a full stomach
02:12:41.44 --> 02:12:45.84 15 years freaking run on a full stomach well I did that's what I'm saying no you know I'm saying
02:12:45.84 --> 02:12:51.12 like there's all kinds of things that you can just push through and still get it in this what I'm
02:12:51.12 --> 02:12:55.52 saying even all the way down to hey who cares if you're there if this person is coming over
02:12:55.52 --> 02:13:00.80 yeah that's that's that's that's the end of the world huh if you're not there you know not the
02:13:00.80 --> 02:13:07.52 end of the world but maybe not the best move at that time okay then we shift to the full stomach
02:13:07.52 --> 02:13:12.56 situation you did it you know or maybe the half stomach you know I'm just saying the opportunities
02:13:12.56 --> 02:13:18.24 always there you know this was in line with sort of this evolving attitude that I have now of of
02:13:19.28 --> 02:13:24.000 kind of a going hard against the weakness yeah I was like it's not only am I gonna run
02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:29.44 still I'm gonna run on a full stomach I just want a puke yeah all the freaking time because that's
02:13:29.44 --> 02:13:34.80 out you know so but I did the same exact thing but it was it was less complex for sure but it was
02:13:34.80 --> 02:13:40.88 like the window was closing like I can't get my full workout now because dinner time like I do you know
02:13:40.88 --> 02:13:44.08 I'm gonna eat dinner with the people you ever just do something super short and psycho though if you
02:13:44.08 --> 02:13:47.92 let the window close it but but you don't want to let it shut so you're like okay cool oh you want to be
02:13:47.92 --> 02:14:02.40 like that cool yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I'll do that a few times when I had to like come
02:14:02.40 --> 02:14:07.12 here somewhere where if I'm late it kind of affects other people you know it's like it's my fault
02:14:07.12 --> 02:14:11.60 anyway you know so oh yeah I'll do that kind of stuff for sure but I did it with the dinner thing
02:14:11.60 --> 02:14:16.24 and I did a Mac on a full stomach and I even told you about it the next house like I was doing
02:14:16.24 --> 02:14:23.44 anyway it's a long story but yeah well thank you time lines let's rock and roll man
02:14:23.44 --> 02:14:27.84 sir alright okay look we're doing workouts we're not doing excuses we're what fighting against
02:14:27.84 --> 02:14:32.64 week this punishing weakness we weakness thoughts we're punishing ourselves for those thoughts
02:14:32.64 --> 02:14:37.84 or considerations but when you do that you know you join your body's take a beating specifically
02:14:37.84 --> 02:14:46.000 your joints from time to time okay jocquoise supplementation for that so some moments are
02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:53.04 jockel fuel joint warfare for your joints super krill oil for your joints vitamin D
02:14:54.24 --> 02:15:01.28 is it super vitamin D we'll just say it's pretty good help it though so let's say super yeah super
02:15:01.28 --> 02:15:05.60 it's not called super vitamin D okay maybe we need to help with branding on that one
02:15:05.60 --> 02:15:10.72 no man like you helped us with super krill I didn't help you I don't want to get it funny
02:15:10.72 --> 02:15:15.92 either way it's vitamin D nonetheless I'm gonna change the name too super right

02:16:42.64 --> 02:16:53.68 discipline go cans just one at about one at about one at about midnight maybe one a clock in the
02:16:53.68 --> 02:17:01.20 morning and I had another one at like two or three that's the kind of that's the that's the that's
02:17:01.20 --> 02:17:06.32 once the sun's coming up you're good once the sun comes up a rock and roll but there's I guess
02:17:06.32 --> 02:17:10.08 maybe around four o'clock in the morning like you don't see as soon as you start seeing sun your body
02:17:10.08 --> 02:17:16.72 goes oh cool we're awake now yeah it's that three 34 or four 30 where your body thinks you should

02:21:41.60 --> 02:21:47.60 look if you want to know about new stuff or how should I want to know about new stuff Dave what
02:21:47.60 --> 02:21:54.24 sure does that this is a deaf core shirt but but it's available it's absolutely available it's called
02:21:54.24 --> 02:22:00.40 ops you have black ops you wear and he has I know I have the black one declassified let's
02:22:00.40 --> 02:22:04.96 call it a classified version but here's the deal the difference you know white shirt and a black shirt
02:22:04.96 --> 02:22:10.88 in the California sun is extreme yes sir so I like to wear a white shirt I don't have this one
02:22:10.88 --> 02:22:18.48 echo Charles yeah yeah thanks that must suck really but hey man you know I know that and maybe
02:22:18.48 --> 02:22:26.40 we'll get you on yeah so yes if you want a uh deaf core black ops or declassified
02:22:26.40 --> 02:22:32.48 talklstrad.com's you call it declassified yes I like it I like it when you sort of
02:22:32.48 --> 02:22:37.60 mingle with military turns you have some swings and you took a you have some misses
02:22:38.48 --> 02:22:44.72 don't know if you're suspect you you contact me yeah yeah say hey what would this be a correct
02:22:44.72 --> 02:22:53.92 usage of the word whatever yeah oftentimes I say yeah there is one thing I did and I think yeah
02:22:53.92 --> 02:22:58.16 it was you all the high speed low drag I was gonna use that in some it wasn't a shirt but it
02:22:58.16 --> 02:23:04.08 was in some other stuff I was doing and you're like hey don't do that don't do that because it
02:23:04.08 --> 02:23:08.72 wasn't like appropriate yeah I forget what it was because high speed low drag is definitely a term
02:23:08.72 --> 02:23:14.80 yes and it has a meaning I forget the way you used it I used it in a more serious way than it
02:23:14.80 --> 02:23:21.04 should be oh yeah that's not a serious term yeah it's kind of like that guy is high speed low drag yeah
02:23:21.04 --> 02:23:28.24 like for real it's kind of like you might say it about a pair of Gucci looking shooting classes yeah

02:25:03.68 --> 02:25:14.000 a YouTube channel by the way we have a YouTube channel that has all these podcasts on them you

02:25:18.32 --> 02:25:24.96 voice even though we did the first podcast on like some kind of live stream if you try to
02:25:24.96 --> 02:25:32.32 yeah what you're saying is I don't remember we were having some trouble technical yeah so anyways or and then also
02:25:33.36 --> 02:25:39.44 some of these are there's some excerpts and there as well and there's also some things that echo
02:25:39.44 --> 02:25:49.44 trolls experiments with random and very over the top special effects on on just normal videos
02:25:49.44 --> 02:25:56.24 and he'll put 98 special effects into a two-minute video but this video right here which is going to be
02:25:56.24 --> 02:26:02.80 three hours and 40 minutes long there will be no no excitement other than just watching me crack
02:26:02.80 --> 02:26:08.96 up at my own jokes at the end of this podcast no additional excitement needed in my opinion so far
02:26:08.96 --> 02:26:15.44 there could be so many good little extra addictions and Easter eggs whatever you call them in this
02:26:15.44 --> 02:26:23.84 particular podcast so I'm about flanking people mortars 37 millimeters 88 grenades just think
02:26:23.84 --> 02:26:30.88 of all the cool stuff that could be flying around in here it's boss blowing up anyway also jockel

02:26:37.68 --> 02:26:46.56 this is don't worry this this is going to help you it helps us so we're talking about inertia right
02:26:46.56 --> 02:26:52.64 object that is in state rest stays at rest tends to stay at rest and if it's in motion say anyway
02:26:53.44 --> 02:26:59.84 if you're battling to get into motion when you're currently at rest and it's hard sometimes it's hard
02:27:00.40 --> 02:27:05.20 I got this will help that is what I'm saying it's psychological warfare okay jockel telling you what to do
02:27:05.20 --> 02:27:12.40 not necessarily what to do but why you should do what you should do it's about accurate right yeah

02:30:28.64 --> 02:30:36.24 freedom and to the police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and
02:30:36.24 --> 02:30:41.76 dispatchers and correctional officers and border patrol and secret service thanks to all of you
02:30:41.76 --> 02:30:50.56 for protecting us and for keeping our nation a nation of law and order not a nation of chaos and
02:30:50.56 --> 02:31:01.60 anarchy into everyone else out there just just remember that the effect on most men
02:31:02.48 --> 02:31:06.72 of the impact of battle is to cause them to want to do nothing
02:31:06.72 --> 02:31:15.76 and it's the same thing with the slings and arrows of life we get pushed toward
02:31:15.76 --> 02:31:27.20 inaction and inactivity and indolence and the solution to that is that a determined effort must
02:31:27.20 --> 02:31:38.72 be exerted to accomplish things to accomplish tasks and that is on you and you know what that means
02:31:38.72 --> 02:31:54.72 it means get out there and get after it and until next time this is Dave and echo and jacco out
