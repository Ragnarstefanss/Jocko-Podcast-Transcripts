[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 271 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willing. Good evening,
[00:00:07] I got good evening.
[00:00:16] First they put us in a school in Tala Far and held us for 20 days. They didn't let us eat or drink.
[00:00:24] Only the children are given a little bread, but we had to go to the bathroom to share it.
[00:00:29] If they caught us sharing, we were tortured. The children were dying, starving.
[00:00:42] They wouldn't drink the little amount of dirty water. So we found some toothpaste and put it in the
[00:00:48] water to pretend it was milk so they would drink it and not die from dehydration.
[00:00:52] Dold of emotion, Basima recalled everything down to the most minor detail.
[00:01:03] How they were transferred to Mazul in cattle trucks and stashed in a traditional ceremony hall.
[00:01:09] How the elderly had to give their children urine to drink to keep them alive after ISIS cut their
[00:01:16] only water pipe. How everyone became so sick and malnourished that clumps of their hair would fall to the floor.
[00:01:29] But the worst was yet to come. In the middle of the night, the ISIS men were coming in and yelling
[00:01:37] to know who is still a virgin, Basima whispered. And from the age of eight, they were taking girls
[00:01:46] to the market to sell for a cigarette. However, Basima and several other siblings fought up a plan
[00:01:56] to avoid being violated. They tried to look like ugly boys by using a piece of broken plate to
[00:02:03] shave their heads and dressed in the men's clothes they found hidden away.
[00:02:10] We thought if they must have stuck us for boys, we would be taken out and killed.
[00:02:14] Rather than raped, she explained. But instead, when they knew our trick, the men came in and
[00:02:23] stripped us in front of everybody. In front of everybody, hundreds. They touched us everywhere,
[00:02:31] sexually abused us. My father and brother had to watch. And that was the last I saw of them.
[00:02:46] Basima did not shut her when she talked about the abuse. She was telling her story, but she was also
[00:02:54] telling somebody else's story. She was telling the story of so many other women. Perhaps that is
[00:03:02] how she was able to get through it with strength by separating herself from the narrative.
[00:03:14] When initially snatched, Gazal was with her six-month-old son,
[00:03:19] Boktyar, and five-year-old daughter, Darren. When Gazal, while Gazal clutched her screaming
[00:03:29] son, Basima claimed to be the mother of Darren, it hopes that the ISIS operatives wouldn't sell her
[00:03:35] if it was clear she was no longer a virgin. Gazal spoke of her ordeal in a tempered rhythm,
[00:03:45] relentlessly tugging at her dress and glaring at her raw crack-tands.
[00:03:54] At first, she said she refused to go with the wally, but he dragged her by her hair and took her to
[00:04:02] her and back to her to the Syrian city of Minn-Biz near the Torque Turkish border.
[00:04:08] They were yanked into a house like the headquarters where there were already two other Yazidi slaves
[00:04:20] and a constant ebb of foreign fighters. The wally said, I must marry him,
[00:04:30] but I refused so he took my son and I didn't see him for two days.
[00:04:35] After that I begged and cried. He started torturing me and said I had no option but to marry him.
[00:04:49] Only it wasn't a real marriage, but it was no ceremony. It was just rape.
[00:04:57] I was forced to be a Muslim to pray five times a day.
[00:05:12] The coalition bombs soon started falling on ISIS installations, bases and homes,
[00:05:18] but they also fell on people who were already scared and suffering, who had no arms and no
[00:05:24] choice but to be there. After Gazal was gone, Basimah said that she and scores of others,
[00:05:32] including Yang Daren were wounded in an air strike on the prison.
[00:05:39] Shrapnel pierced her head. Basimah's only treatment was her long ebbony locks getting shaved off.
[00:05:46] She received no medicine. The slaves were propelled down 22 skewed steps into an underground
[00:05:56] weapon storage filled with guns and bombs which would become their living quarters for more than a year.
[00:06:07] We were tortured. There were no toilets, we had to eat, sleep and do the necessary
[00:06:15] all in the same place. All kinds of insects and flies were in there. They forced us to convert to
[00:06:25] Islam. We were made to look at beheaded bodies through the little window.
[00:06:33] We didn't know when our time was up. All we could think about was whether it was better to live
[00:06:42] or to die. What is a war? It is trying to remember those we treasure who are taken while
[00:07:07] at the same time trying to let them go. What is war? It is waiting to kill or is waiting to be killed.
[00:07:18] What is war? War is a war inside the war which the world cannot see.
[00:07:25] But sometimes if you get close enough you can hear it. It is inmates being endlessly beaten,
[00:07:32] lashed, mailed with statistic tools and kept in small cages. What is war?
[00:07:43] A human shell might have made it through the storm in one piece. But what is inside will forever
[00:07:48] be filled with a dull pain of waiting, waiting for evil to enter to violate the person they once were
[00:07:56] one more time. What is war? It is ugly. It is lies. It is ugly. Lies. What is war?
[00:08:11] War is distrust, dishonesty, skepticism. What is war? War is a vision of agony that becomes normal.
[00:08:26] That's what war does to people. What is war? Everything you could imagine hell to be.
[00:08:34] Only worse. And those are some excerpts from a book called Only Cry for the Living,
[00:08:54] which as you can see is a harling book about the absolutely savage reign of terror perpetrated by ISIS.
[00:09:06] I rack and Syria. And throughout the book, it asks that question over and over again. What is war?
[00:09:13] War. And that is a complex question. And it requires answers from many different angles.
[00:09:28] And this book does an incredible job of giving us some of those answers. The book was written by
[00:09:35] an Australian American journalist by the name of Holly McKay who spent time on the ground in Iraq.
[00:09:44] Afghanistan and Syria has been embedded with Australian and American troops sat through military
[00:09:51] tribunals and interviewed hundreds of soldiers, civilians, and government officials before
[00:09:59] during and after the horrors of war. And it is an honor to have Holly here with us to share
[00:10:12] some of her experiences and some of the things that she learned along the way. Holly.
[00:10:22] Thank you so much for coming down to join us. Thank you for having me. This is definitely
[00:10:29] a very rough subject that you dove into and that you pursued. And I didn't know you or anything about
[00:10:40] you really until I started reading through the book. I just basically knew that you were a journalist.
[00:10:47] But there's some interesting the pathway that you took to get here as I kind of explored that
[00:10:52] is interesting. And before we jump into the book, I just want to kind of get some of your background.
[00:11:00] You know what's going to say most books and it's true. And most books people at least
[00:11:05] people write books and they say they're not about themselves, but they write about themselves.
[00:11:08] Right? And you actually don't spend a lot of time writing about yourself in this book.
[00:11:13] So just a little background before we jump in about, you know, so you were born in Australia.
[00:11:20] Yes. So I was born in North Queensland in Australia and my dad was in the mine so we moved
[00:11:24] around a fair bit. And then when I was very young, I became very, very heavily involved in ballet.
[00:11:31] And so when I was 15, I went to a boarding school. It was kind of a fame school
[00:11:38] in Sydney where we could train full time in different sort of arts. And then we did our sort of
[00:11:45] schooling on the side as well with that. And we could all work professionally. And so it was just a
[00:11:50] very interesting way to study and grow up. And I really thought that that was the career that I was
[00:11:56] going to go into. It was going to be ballet dance. It was going to be ballet. Also that is a
[00:12:00] psycho totally psycho thing. Totally psycho thing. And I, you know, but what I always say and people think
[00:12:06] it's just it was the best training ground for what I ended up doing because you you learn to just
[00:12:13] to push yourself beyond any kind of boundary that you ever think. And that's just normal. And when
[00:12:18] you're that young, you're just it's normal to be 15 hours a day in these crazy shoes with bloody
[00:12:24] feet and being yelled at and being told, you know, you can only eat this, this and this and you
[00:12:28] have to weigh this. And it's just this so much discipline involved in it. And it really was the
[00:12:33] most amazing training ground. But on top of that, what it did was it really taught me so much
[00:12:38] about the world that I wouldn't have known in my Australian bubble. When you say what you just
[00:12:43] realize that through ballet, there's all these different countries. You know, I'll get yeah,
[00:12:49] like I give me something to go on. Because for me, you grow up a little New England kid. It's like,
[00:12:52] okay, cool, this is the world. Yeah, and it's, you know, I learned about the civil rights movement
[00:12:57] through Alvin Ali who was this incredible, he's got an art center in New York City. And that's how
[00:13:04] he had this amazing piece called Revelations. And I just remember being about 16 and just watching
[00:13:09] it and just the music and it was gospel music. And I learned about this sort of whole culture.
[00:13:14] And we did that with so many parts of it. I think the Rolling Stones, that was this amazing
[00:13:19] ballet with that Canadian company, it's set to the Rolling Stones. And so I learned about
[00:13:24] hedonism and all these, you know, different things in an era that I really didn't know. And
[00:13:29] it really sparked this insatiable appetite for the world. And that was through the music. And
[00:13:35] this sort of deeply, a beyond that. And I really, that was what I wanted to pursue. And that's
[00:13:40] sort of why I guess I left, I left time very young to go and study. I broke my ankle. So that sort of
[00:13:46] set back some of the immediate professional ideals that I had. And so as soon as I kind of healed a
[00:13:53] bit, gone to university, an opportunity came up to go to New York to, I had, I got a scholarship
[00:13:59] I could finish my degree there. And so I thought, you know, well, finish a degree. Maybe I'll go
[00:14:04] back into the arts. I didn't work out that way. I ended up in a journalism career and it was not planned at all.
[00:14:11] But yeah. When you went to New York, did you go to study dance still?
[00:14:15] No, so I was studying at a small university, just off Wall Street, called Paste. That was affiliated
[00:14:20] with my university in Sydney. And I was studying, it was media arts, but I had a specialty kind of
[00:14:26] in writing was what I loved. And I wasn't sure what direction I was going to take that or whether
[00:14:31] I was going to go back into the ballet field. So being in New York City, I got a chance to do both,
[00:14:38] you know, sort of the hub of creativity really. And kind of study and have a really great time.
[00:14:44] I turned 21 in New York. Then, then, so did you, what did you end up getting your degree in?
[00:14:51] Media Arts and Production. And with the specialization, you know, it's a fancy BA, but it's,
[00:14:58] I specialized in sort of writing and human rights issues. So I always had that sort of passion
[00:15:03] of trying to understand the world in a little bit of a deeper lens, I guess, at that point.
[00:15:09] So what year did you graduate from college? 2003. And then, did you go back to Australia?
[00:15:15] So no, so when I was in New York and I arrived and then everybody is talking about these internships.
[00:15:22] And I had no idea what it was. You know, Australia, we just work, you know, you work, you go to school,
[00:15:28] you, whatever. So they're talking about internships and I was like, I want to do one of those things.
[00:15:32] What are they? This sounds fascinating. And I went to a bunch of websites and
[00:15:38] stumbled across a fox website. And I didn't, I didn't even know what fox news was at that time.
[00:15:42] And it was early digital era. And I taught myself to web code just for fun one at school. And so they
[00:15:50] said, well, we're building up a digital thing, you know, you obviously seem to like that kind of thing.
[00:15:56] Would you like to do that? So I thought, yeah, I'll give this a go. This sounds great. And so I joined
[00:16:02] the newsroom there. And I really, I fell in love with storytelling in a different way. I was so used
[00:16:08] to doing it through dance, through physically, through my body, through other, and being able to kind
[00:16:15] of be there and it was much more literal than what I'd used to. But I really, I fell in love with it
[00:16:20] and being able to write. And this whole new medium was just beginning. And I just, I really threw
[00:16:26] myself into it. And I loved it. And then, at the end of it, you know, as I said, I was 21 and they
[00:16:32] said, well, sponsor you if you'd like to come in and work here full of time. And so that sort of
[00:16:36] made up my mind pretty quickly that that was a pretty amazing opportunity. And the dance career
[00:16:43] might have to be for another life. So yeah, so I was sponsored. And they said, would you like to go to
[00:16:52] LA? And I was, I was really in love with New York. But I said, sure, let's go to LA. And let's do this.
[00:16:56] And so I went to LA. And I guess by default, being in Los Angeles, there was, you know, the entertainment
[00:17:04] hub of the world. And so that sort of seems to be, and I had my own column, which again was sort of
[00:17:12] a bit of a baptism by fire. And I was just immediately thrown into this cage of, oh, yeah, I described it
[00:17:20] when I got there, Joko. It was the summer of 2007. And Paratelsin had just gotten out of jail.
[00:17:26] And somehow I'd made friends with an assistant of hers. And she was living in this beach house
[00:17:31] down in Malibu. And so every day we go to these parties at Paratelsin. And it was, the paparazzi
[00:17:38] were lining up on the beach. And I just remember thinking, this is the biggest circus I've ever seen.
[00:17:43] Like, this is this is ridiculous. And it stayed that way for me. And I think even though I had
[00:17:51] some really incredible opportunities and to meet really amazing people too. And I don't think I really
[00:17:57] at the time, you know, when you get to sit down for 20 minutes with Steven Spielberg or something,
[00:18:03] I don't think I really, you know, valued. I think it was just, it was too young to kind of understand.
[00:18:08] This is pretty cool. But I just got to meet so many people from different walks of life. I would be
[00:18:14] I'd be covering a sug-night trial and comp to it. And then next minute I'd be, you know, driving to
[00:18:20] a choreography session with the SPICE Girls reunion tour. It was just this real crazy, you know,
[00:18:26] they'd be at that, you know, a ditty's party and then I would be at, you know, some other cool place.
[00:18:32] And it put to me the funny thing about it was I always felt, I was the outside looking in at something.
[00:18:38] I never felt part of it. I just felt like this was this, it was a launch pad, but it was this
[00:18:45] incredible stepping stone. And I guess similar to the ballet, it told me something really crucial,
[00:18:52] which was just enough out the BS. And that's something that's, I don't think there's a better training
[00:18:58] ground for that than than being in that entertainment world. Because you learn to see through people so
[00:19:04] quickly and you learn to really navigate, there's so many layers around these people. They have
[00:19:10] publicist managers, there's just so many layers. And a lot of intimidation people trying to stop
[00:19:17] you from running a story, people trying to spin this this way that way. And it really taught me
[00:19:23] it from a very young age to be very resilient against that. To be, no, that's not, that's not what I saw.
[00:19:28] That's not what happened. That's not what the situation is. Why are you doing that? And I think,
[00:19:34] yeah, I can't imagine that's something that's really served me, served me really well.
[00:19:39] So the name of this, what was the name of your column? Poptons. This is my old boss. I don't know where
[00:19:45] that came from. He just came up with it when day to day. This is what it's going to be. And I,
[00:19:50] let's do it. Did you, isn't it, as a reporter, aren't you supposed to feel like an outsider?
[00:19:57] Are you supposed to be on the outside looking in? And technically yes, but in the entertainment industry,
[00:20:02] and this is one thing that always bothered me about it was that people were so busy trying to be
[00:20:08] friends with these people. And I could never get my head around. And I was like, they're not my friend.
[00:20:13] I don't want to be that friend. I have my own friends. And so I think people always,
[00:20:17] automatically assume that you must, yeah, that you must, you know, want to be this friend and everyone's
[00:20:23] kissing each other's ass on a red carpet. Don't you look great tonight? No, what?
[00:20:29] So people get totally sucked into the whole thing. Totally sucked in. Yeah. And that was what,
[00:20:34] yeah, that was one thing that annoyed Mary. I, I remember being about 22 and one of those
[00:20:39] big entertainment shows, a producer had approached me and said, you know, we'd love to talk to you
[00:20:44] about a job in this and that and probably stupidly because the money was probably quite good. But I
[00:20:50] said, oh, no, not interested. Thank you. And that was about my immediate reaction was I would just
[00:20:56] have to sit there and basically be nice to you all the time. And that wasn't, that wasn't the
[00:21:01] person I was. I wanted to understand the real story behind it. And it's hard to do that in the
[00:21:10] Hollywood without sort of being being shunned, I guess. And anyone who does kind of do that,
[00:21:14] they are shunned. They don't get the access. They want to, the places and things. And I think
[00:21:20] people are really drawn to that world because they want to feel that, that being part of something.
[00:21:26] So at what point did you sort of envision where what you really wanted to do?
[00:21:34] So I was a slow process. I started to do a lot more sort of investigative work. And then I would sort
[00:21:42] of pick up different politics stories. I was always very vested in world affairs and there was a great
[00:21:49] afar and correspondence in our bureau and he'd spent a lot of time living in Pakistan and just,
[00:21:54] you know, having credible stories and he really, and I sat with him and he really gave me that
[00:21:59] encouragement that I needed. And that was just you just have to go and do it. You love to travel,
[00:22:04] you've traveled to all these places and I, and I traveled a lot and I'd sort of learnt to speak
[00:22:09] a little bit of Arabic it's gone now. But growing up I'd learned to speak and I just had a real
[00:22:15] appetite for understanding different parts of the world and kind of growing up, growing up in the
[00:22:21] time when Afghanistan and Iraq and a lot of friends of mine that were my age were kind of being deployed.
[00:22:28] And so I always really wanted to understand it and then with his name was Dominique and his support
[00:22:35] was just you've just got to go and do it. And so I just, I really just had to put myself out there.
[00:22:41] I had to be that annoying person to my bosses. I wanted you this. I wanted to do this. I wanted to do this.
[00:22:46] And luckily I had people in New York that supported me that looked at my work and thought, well,
[00:22:54] we've thrown her on so many different stories and she's always managed to come back with something.
[00:22:59] And she knows how to investigate. She knows how to work independently. So why not?
[00:23:03] So that was sort of my, my segue into it. And I really reached a point where I knew I had to leave
[00:23:08] that it's a tame thing and did you create enemies in the entertainment thing?
[00:23:12] And I wouldn't say I created enemies. I mean, there was certain, you know,
[00:23:17] I definitely had a few run-ins and I definitely spoke my mind.
[00:23:21] Probably more than it seems like if you had the attitude like, I'm going to tell the truth and
[00:23:25] people are trying to adjust your stories and you're like, not not complying with what they want you to do.
[00:23:30] It seems like it'd be pretty easy environment to make people mad. Yes.
[00:23:35] Yeah, I did. And then, sort of I guess, toward the last year or six months I was doing it. I,
[00:23:43] I probably looking back and I'd check that out a little bit. But yeah, you do. You create enemies
[00:23:49] as you go. And again, I just, I think I just slowly was removing myself at that point anyway.
[00:23:55] So what was the first, did you get like an assignment to, like your first assignment that started
[00:24:00] to move you down this path of this going to war? So I was, I was in, and I sort of been traveling
[00:24:08] through the area and then I ended up doing some work there. I guess the biggest one was,
[00:24:14] I was in the Middle East during when 2014, the Warbroke out in Gaza. So I was sort of going back
[00:24:23] and forth between Israel and Gaza and sort of being able to cover it because I was there.
[00:24:29] That was kind of my baptism by fire. What were you doing there? I was vacationing, visiting
[00:24:35] friends in Jordan. I was hanging out with Bedouins in a Bedouin tent. And you know,
[00:24:39] you know, a pen in a notebook and a comma. Yeah, and then you have contacts back in your
[00:24:45] news station. You say, here's what's going on. And I wrote some stuff there and then I sort of went
[00:24:51] back and I thought this was just, and at that time that was also when I assisted sort of really
[00:24:55] sparked, I guess, in the Middle East. And I'd been covering a closely sort of following the
[00:25:03] Arab Spring, which was all in those years prior to that. So I just, I was so invested in it,
[00:25:09] I guess. And I harassed and harassed and then made contacts with different people and fixes on the ground
[00:25:16] in Iraq. And yeah, I went for to cover ISIS, I guess, after that would have been the fall of 2014.
[00:25:26] So that was in the very beginning stages. I mean, I'm just sitting here thinking,
[00:25:34] we, everybody kind of knew what ISIS was. It's a very courageous move to say,
[00:25:40] that's what I'm going to go. Do go find out what these folks are up to. And I use the term folks
[00:25:45] very loosely with them. You know, I'm going to end and, and, um, as I read through the book, which I'm
[00:25:53] going to, I'm not going to do it justice because, you know, we're only going to read, obviously,
[00:25:58] not going to read the whole thing right now. The, the book is, you know, I got the manuscript.
[00:26:04] I don't know when. So a year ago, six months ago, a year ago, something like that,
[00:26:09] because we ended up publishing it at Jockel Publishing, which was awesome. It's, when I, I read
[00:26:14] like the first seven pages and just said to myself, are you kidding me? This thing, this story needs to
[00:26:20] get out. So with that, um, I always have to make that caveat that when I read this thing,
[00:26:28] it's, if it seems like it's, oh, wait, where did that come from? Who's that character? It's because
[00:26:32] I'm not reading the whole thing. And you, you have to get the book to really, to follow your story.
[00:26:40] And it is chronological, you know, it starts off in November of 2014. It ends up when close to 2019,
[00:26:46] I think, but it is chronological, but it's also, it's a moves around from location to location,
[00:26:52] story to story, because sometimes you're in Baghdad, sometimes you're in Raka, sometimes you're
[00:26:57] out on the outskirts of Missouil, you're traveling to all these different places, but it's,
[00:27:02] it's way more evident when you read the book, the whole book rather than me just sitting here reading
[00:27:08] chunks of it. So that's my caveat. When you are traveling over there, just, are you just traveling,
[00:27:18] are you traveling on an American passport? So I became an American citizen in 2017. So initially,
[00:27:26] I was just Australian, I was a green cod holder, and then I got, I got my citizenship in 2017.
[00:27:33] And then when you're traveling into a country, so I was in the military, and so we would have
[00:27:40] an official passport. So not a diplomatic passport, which was a black passport,
[00:27:46] but not a regular American passport, which is a maroon passport. We would have blue passports,
[00:27:51] which said that we're official, I guess, government Americans, is there anything that you have
[00:27:58] that gives you some kind of indication as press? Nope, journalists, it just regular citizens.
[00:28:06] Nothing special. You're rolling in there. Yeah. Who's supplying you with gear? Who's giving you
[00:28:12] body armor? Who's giving you helmets? Right. So I did, I did have my, we all generally as journalists,
[00:28:18] we all have our own, or I arranged to wherever I'm going, if I could. Get me training? Yeah,
[00:28:24] we're kind of chasing this. Just sort of basic, you know, a hostage training, just kind of the
[00:28:28] basic first aid. You just kind of have to do a few basic things you go, but most of my training
[00:28:35] was really on the ground. And the approach that I decided to take really early on, which I think
[00:28:40] served me, and it's probably their approach that I will always take, is very under the radar. So
[00:28:48] I would see people that went in, especially, and it's very difficult with television, because television
[00:28:52] crews have to go in with cameras, and they go in with a lot of security, and you become very visible.
[00:28:59] For me, I went in. I would organize to meet with locals wherever it is. I was going my local fixer,
[00:29:07] local house, I'd be staying in, and I would just very much go under the radar. And to me,
[00:29:12] that was always the way that I felt that I could get the story, and even though people thought,
[00:29:17] oh, you have to have security, you have to have this, you have to have that.
[00:29:20] I never felt they needed that. I felt that that would have made me more of a known presence,
[00:29:27] which would have been more dangerous for me. As a writer, I felt that I didn't need a lot of those
[00:29:33] things, and that was always, and I discussed those things with my, with my superiors, and ahead of time,
[00:29:40] and that was always something that they took, and enabled me to make those decisions, and be that
[00:29:47] independent. And how good was your Arabic? It was okay for a while. Where did you learn Arabic?
[00:29:53] You know, I grew up, so where I was going to school was a sort of there was a big Lebanese community there.
[00:29:59] So I was interested, and I just, I would have people teach me, and so, but I always worked with
[00:30:04] the translator because I couldn't pick up the dialects. I mean, the dialects were just so confusing,
[00:30:09] and I didn't want to risk ever, I guess, getting something that would have been crucial and getting it wrong.
[00:30:15] Yeah, I know that the locals' ability to understand and give you these nuanced things,
[00:30:22] you know, the interpreters that we had would, you know, because we'd have, we'd have Americans,
[00:30:26] like seals that had been trained to speak Arabic. I God bless them. They do their best.
[00:30:32] But like you just, they be standing side by side with a native speaker, and, you know, my
[00:30:40] seal interpreter would say, hey, the local guy said this, and then the native speaker would say,
[00:30:46] hey, here's what he actually means, and there's just a little bit that you're just not going to catch,
[00:30:51] you know, it's just not going to happen. So you definitely, it's like trying to
[00:30:57] try to tell the difference between, you know, someone that's from New York, and someone that's from New Jersey.
[00:31:02] There's people that can go, oh, yeah, guys from Jersey, that guy's from New York, you know,
[00:31:05] and the same thing overseas. And you are correct. Here's the weird thing about what you said about
[00:31:13] security is a low profile, 99% of the time is going to be better, no one's going to notice you,
[00:31:23] no one's going to care, but people freak out about us. There's that 1% of the time, and then what
[00:31:28] do you do? And then you weigh those out, because if it's only, if there's only a tiny chance of
[00:31:32] something happening, and then you're in a really bad situation, because you don't have any security,
[00:31:36] that's horrible. But when you have security, you increase the chances so much that it's a gamble.
[00:31:43] This is always a gamble. And I always felt very comfortable in the fixes and the people that I use
[00:31:49] locally that they had sort of the know how to at least, you know, with exit plans and other things like
[00:31:56] that. And I always had context in the US, in the region, and other places that if I was desperate,
[00:32:02] that I could, I could turn to if I, if I needed to. How did you go about finding your fixtures?
[00:32:08] General, I mean, depending on the sort of assignment by assignment, but I usually went through
[00:32:13] either other journalists who gave referrals to people that they'd worked with, or people that
[00:32:18] knew that were living there without the businesses that had used different interpreters. It really
[00:32:22] really depended on that. But usually, it's always what a mouth. I would never just pluck
[00:32:27] somebody a face-fucking and expect them to be a fixer. It always be several layers of people who
[00:32:35] could sort of vet and work for them and then do a little bit of my own background digging on them
[00:32:40] and just try to make sure. And you can never get it right there. I mean, there's plenty of situations
[00:32:44] and unfortunately, we're journalists have been sold out and other things, and we saw that a lot
[00:32:49] in Syria with us, but in my case, I always worked with some really just incredible people.
[00:33:00] I've got all kinds of scenarios running through my head right now.
[00:33:03] I get an attention. When I look back at my life, my whole life, in my entire life, from the time
[00:33:09] I was born until like two days ago, I always think about all the things that I've done, where I look
[00:33:14] back and say, man, that wasn't too smart. How good. Do you do that? I was in the medicine that I thought
[00:33:19] the things that I did. I mean, not just in a rock, but in a rather places in Yemen and Afghanistan,
[00:33:24] and in my 20s, and I just would never do them now. I would never do them now. I look back and I think,
[00:33:30] what were you thinking? Or, I guess, in the beginning, and this is where experience comes into it.
[00:33:39] You almost, maybe it's naivety. You don't always know what you're getting yourself into,
[00:33:45] and you get out of it, and you find, and then I look back on it now, and I think that was so stupid.
[00:33:52] What you're thinking? That wasn't all worth the story. I mean, did you even get a story out of that?
[00:33:59] Yeah. As I read your book, that's what I was thinking. There's a lot of you got lucky a lot,
[00:34:06] which is awesome. You know, you had a massive amount of courage to go into these, which is awesome.
[00:34:11] And I wanted to ask you that. Did you feel, do you feel looking back like now, like you
[00:34:17] you were a little naiv at the time? And obviously, sometimes a little bit of naivety and arrogance
[00:34:26] is really nice when you look back at it if it went well. Which it certainly did for you.
[00:34:31] Awesome. All right. I'm going to jump into this book. The first boy to introduce himself was
[00:34:40] a nine-year-old named Abdulla. He struck me with his light eyes, gap to smile, and spattering of
[00:34:46] freckles across his nose. There was a gentleness to it, to his demeanor. I wondered how such
[00:34:51] gentleness could come from a child that had been ripped from his home by war. Abdulla told us that
[00:34:58] he was a Muslim from Sinjar, or Sinjal, as they say in Kurdish. He had been forced to flee
[00:35:06] two months earlier when ISIS invaded his village. He insisted on showing us around the camp,
[00:35:11] annotated, annotating like a proud tour guide. He explained the different people who lived there,
[00:35:16] and where they were all from. He explained how they had been confronted with the same vicious enemy,
[00:35:21] and how they coped in different ways. Some ISIS we knew, Abdulla said,
[00:35:27] some of our neighbors became ISIS too. I did not know then that such a phrase would be repeated
[00:35:33] time and time again as the years went on. I did not realize then the importance of that phrase.
[00:35:39] The clef's and all the conspiracies that would come from it. That one phrase would come to
[00:35:46] represent the fissures of a country that I wasn't sure could ever be put back together. Our neighbors
[00:35:52] became ISIS too. You know, the something that I failed to do as I put these notes together is
[00:36:00] is you, throughout the book, you pick these characters and you revisit them.
[00:36:05] And I get some of them, but I don't get all of them. I'm not sure if I get back to Abdulla,
[00:36:10] but that's what you do. As people hear me talk about these different characters,
[00:36:15] look, the book is 450 pages long. If people are wondering, oh, I wonder what happened to that
[00:36:22] kid or what happened to that character, many of the characters that you become close with,
[00:36:27] you revisit over the years. And as I said, the length of the book is five years or four or four
[00:36:33] and a half years, something like that. There's a lot. I mean, think of a kid that's 10 years old becomes
[00:36:38] 14. That's a big difference. And obviously there are also our characters that
[00:36:43] you never see again. And God knows what happens to them. Fast forward a little bit here. The
[00:36:53] soldiers at the Mazul Dam greeted us warmly. The Peshmerga began and this, I'm giving everyone a background
[00:36:59] in Peshmerga, what you do and look, you give all kinds of nice little history lessons in here, too.
[00:37:03] The Peshmerga began as something of a mountain militia in the 1920s when the push for Kurdish
[00:37:09] independence began. In recent decades, they had faced unrelenting persecution from the bath
[00:37:14] loyalist and of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, one Peshmerga fighter told me they don't
[00:37:21] suffer from psychological issues pertaining to combat because they have grown up around fighting
[00:37:26] and have developed an early understanding that it is just what we have to do to them PTSD
[00:37:32] was something of a first world phenomenon. We worked with Kurdish soldiers sometimes in the Iraqi
[00:37:40] Army and they were just really good and they just were really good. They have that's why that's what
[00:37:48] they do. They grow up fighting. That's sort of their thing. It's like when you're in the US military
[00:37:53] and you meet someone that's from Wyoming and they grew up hunting and living out in the land
[00:38:02] and they're going to be good soldiers. That's just how it is. Somebody from Alabama that grew up in the
[00:38:06] woods, they're going to be a good soldier. That's just how it is. That's how you feel about the
[00:38:10] Kurds. That's how I always felt about the Kurds. And just because they say they don't
[00:38:13] self-fulfirm any psychological problems doesn't mean they don't. And that's just a very different
[00:38:18] relationship that they have with it. And not just the Peshmega but in a lot of the, you know, in
[00:38:23] the Middle East and those in the armies and things it's just not something that they
[00:38:28] acknowledge or really talk about. Yeah, in many ways it's something that we haven't talked about
[00:38:35] up until these reap most recent wars. Yep. Even though it's always been there,
[00:38:41] you continue on here. The Peshmega soldiers range from around 18 to more than 70 years old with many
[00:38:46] coming out of retirement in the quest to defeat ISIS threat. During days of intense conflict,
[00:38:52] the Peshmega are lucky to return to their base for two or three hours of sleep and a quick
[00:38:56] bite to eat before venturing back to their fighting locus. As it's due to a prominent portion of
[00:39:02] the fighters are not soldiers but what they call security advisors who don't take a salary and volunteer
[00:39:07] simply out of devotion. There are special forces that have been arranged for these people.
[00:39:13] They don't register their names and don't sign contracts. They just want to serve and Kurdistan.
[00:39:22] One Peshmega soldier explained how ISIS commanders often drug young fighters with special
[00:39:27] tablets that leave them disoriented and shooting wildly into the night. Sometimes they were able
[00:39:32] to keep going despite being shot several times taking upwards of 20 bullets before they went down.
[00:39:38] For those who survive and that's been referenced the ISIS fighters,
[00:39:41] when they realize what they've done, they sometimes regret it.
[00:39:49] And you say here, almost every Kurd wants to share their history. History of their people and
[00:39:56] their oppression. But the string that could be weaved through and through was that they did not expect
[00:40:01] to be granted freedom for nothing. They knew they would have to fight for every fight for it every
[00:40:05] step of the way. The secession of let downs, of losses and gains was all part of their rough climb
[00:40:11] up the rope of revolution. At the top they would find their independence. When they referred to
[00:40:17] their soldiers killed on the battlefield, they sometimes said that they were martyred and sometimes
[00:40:21] said that they were murdered. I wondered how differently Americans would see wars if the press
[00:40:27] and the people spoke of our troops in the firing line as having died in a homicide rather than
[00:40:32] killed an action. And now you reflect on this battle that had taken place. The rain fell harder,
[00:40:39] the bullets flew wildly into the growing darkness that hid the dead ISIS bodies nearby.
[00:40:45] Hungry, untamed dogs had gouged into the skeletons almost immediately. Some had been dead for days.
[00:40:52] Some had names and others had been left nameless. Some,
[00:40:57] maculated by the creatures howling at the moon, had no faces. So you jump right into this stuff
[00:41:09] with, I mean this battle that's taking place up at the muzzle dam, you're seeing the ISIS fighters.
[00:41:16] This is a long way from Paris Hilton's Malibu beach parties, I guess. Definitely.
[00:41:23] And when I first went, you know, I didn't go with the intention of of going to the front lines.
[00:41:30] I really went with the intention of trying to understand, I guess the human cost of war and I really
[00:41:36] just wanted to go and talk to people that lived there. I wanted to understand what it was like to
[00:41:41] be a displaced person, what it was like to sort of have everything and then have nothing.
[00:41:48] And I just happened to sort of make a good connection through somebody and then when I went to meet him,
[00:41:57] it was a crazy story. He came and picked us up. The car got stuck in the mud and there was sort of
[00:42:05] a lot of fighting going on and we sort of had to go into a different direction and then we ended up
[00:42:10] sort of on the front lines. It wasn't something that even really planned and I'm sure my boss
[00:42:14] would have had a heart attack if I sort of told them in advance. But yeah, it was a it was a night
[00:42:20] very eye opening and even when I I guess the times that I've spent with the Peshmerga with other
[00:42:27] soldiers, Iraqi soldiers on the front line, it's always still being that same theme for me
[00:42:32] of wanting to get that human cost. So I'm much more interested in in those stories, I guess,
[00:42:38] from my perspective than what we call the Bang Bang. It's what journalists usually call that,
[00:42:43] the sort of the more military aspect of it. I want to understand who they were, who their families were.
[00:42:49] What their motivation for being there was, as you said, it's, you know, these people coming out
[00:42:54] and volunteering and then not getting paid and they're bringing their AK47 from home and they don't
[00:43:00] really have much more beyond that. And I just that to me was fascinating. What is it? What is motivating you?
[00:43:06] What is driving you? What? What are you sacrificing to do this and do you plan to just keep doing this
[00:43:12] over and over again? And I think for me that was always the question that I was trying to
[00:43:19] trying to understand, trying to piece together in my head.
[00:43:24] Yeah, and as I'm sitting here thinking about you on the front lines for the first time,
[00:43:28] sort of and then going back to the conversation we had about being naive and I just,
[00:43:34] I just remembered a conversation. First of all, I've had this conversation with a bunch of
[00:43:37] veterans, but the one that came to my mind was a guy by the name of Dean Ladd, who is a
[00:43:44] Marine in World War II who went on the island campaign and he was going into Tahrua as a Marine,
[00:43:55] as a Marine, Paltoon Commander or a Company Commander, I forget which.
[00:43:59] But I, there was, this was an insane operation. They could tell it was going to be insane.
[00:44:04] You know, they're going to storm the beaches where the Japanese had been dug in for three years.
[00:44:09] And he did this over and over again. But I, you know, I said, well, did you think anything might
[00:44:13] happen to you? He said, no, that's always going to happen to the other guy, which is what everybody thinks,
[00:44:18] creatures what everybody thinks. And you know, that's what I think, you know, that's probably going
[00:44:23] to happen to somebody else, but not me. Yeah. And I think just, I guess by nature, you know, with a lot of
[00:44:28] journalists, whether they've had, you know, tremendous years behind them doing this or not, it's, I guess it's
[00:44:34] that same notion of, you know, we're not working for the government, we're not working for anyone in
[00:44:41] particular, you know, beyond our organizations. And so you sort of have this kind of strange freedom.
[00:44:48] Now, what it's telling you what to do, you know, and, and, and, and for me, I guess I really
[00:44:54] want to take advantage of that and, and just, yeah, I remember one time being it, um, did you
[00:45:00] have a good at tauging your face? Just that's not a bad guy. I think I flew through there, but I never
[00:45:06] spent any more time. I spent a bit of time there and I was with the Aussie, and then I was supposed
[00:45:10] to go to Ellisad on the, at the Marine Base there, and there was just dust storm after dust
[00:45:15] storms. Every flight was getting canceled. I was like, I just want to go back to Baghdad. I was
[00:45:19] trying to get an interview with Saadar, and I, which just, let's just go to Baghdad, and I couldn't
[00:45:25] get back to Baghdad. And so I was literally just calling a cab from Taji to like, come and get
[00:45:30] me, so I could drive back to my hotel and meet my fixer and Baghdad. I remember the Aussie's is standing
[00:45:35] and I'm going, you'll just crazy, and then it's so really jealous. I was like, yeah, I can, I can do that.
[00:45:42] Yeah, and what's interesting going back to the earlier conversation, if you were to take a
[00:45:47] convoy back from there to Baghdad, you would probably be a great risk. Much greater risk than if you
[00:45:54] were in a cab on Orange and White Opal, Freaking Taxi Cab that are driving all over the place.
[00:45:59] Yeah, and I, I would do that through rock. I remember going through like all these Iranian
[00:46:04] militia checkpoints, and I was, would be in these, Yazidi cars with a baby on my lap, pretending
[00:46:09] I was a Yazidi. You know, put the scarf over my head, there's a baby in my lap. I think I managed
[00:46:15] to get through about 100 of these Iranian chia checkpoints and not one of them questioned me.
[00:46:22] And I remember just getting out of that being like, oh, I had, and I know of other journalists,
[00:46:26] I knew a couple of people and they, they got busted a checkpoints and turned around or turned in
[00:46:32] or whatever it was and, and for me that was going under the radar. I got to where I needed to be.
[00:46:38] Had I even got the the checkpoint permission slips that you're supposed to get? I wouldn't have
[00:46:44] gotten through. So sometimes you just got to not play by the rules. Under the radar, that's the theme.
[00:46:52] I got one more, maybe it's not the last one, but earlier in the book, there are some history lessons,
[00:46:57] like I said, even though most of the book is more just interviews with people and what you're actually
[00:47:03] saying, this is a little history lesson on March 17th, 1988, the morning after Saddam Hussein's
[00:47:08] bath party unleashed a tirade of chemical weapons and killed 5,000 Iraqi Kurds in the city of
[00:47:14] Hullab, Hullab. So how much are you? Hullab, a few brave photojournalists have ventured into the
[00:47:21] city to ensure the brutal dictators atrocities would be documented and exposed to the world.
[00:47:28] And you're, you're now interacting with one of them. Accrum looked at me shyly extending his hand.
[00:47:33] Nearly 27 years later, he was working at the memorial site known as the Hullab-Jum Monument and
[00:47:40] Peace Museum constructed in 2003. On the anniversary of the attack in 2006, residents,
[00:47:47] thousands of residents rioted at the site, protesting what they thought was to be capitalizing
[00:47:52] on the tragedy and misusing aid funds destroying many of the archives. The monument was rebuilt
[00:47:57] into a hub of reflection and solace poised against the serene Iranian mountain side with several
[00:48:05] abandoned bath party tanks sitting idly to one side inside the iconic photographs taken
[00:48:10] in the pallet aftermath of the attacks had been recreated as life-sized images and statues.
[00:48:16] A mother clutching her dead bite baby, lifeless children strewn across pavements.
[00:48:23] And here's Acrum talking, we need to remind the new generation about what happened to
[00:48:27] this town and we need to keep reminding them so that it doesn't happen again.
[00:48:35] Sometimes I can't stop crying. Every day I look at the pictures and I am reminded that it is
[00:48:40] my family in those pictures and quote, there was such a depth of sadness in the way he shared
[00:48:47] a story constantly relieving a cursed history. Sodom had ordered the chemical attack,
[00:48:53] amid the Iran Iraq war following intel reports that Iranian soldiers had been implanted inside
[00:48:59] the Kurdish city. Acrum still didn't seem quite sure how or why his life was spared,
[00:49:08] or why he was the only survivor within the proximate area. He recalled having instinctively placed
[00:49:14] his mother's scarf around his mouth for protection the moment something fell wrong.
[00:49:19] He recalled throwing up blood into the scarf which still smelled of his mother even though she was dead
[00:49:26] beside him. He recalled the way the vision blurred slowly fading into blackness.
[00:49:35] He remembered cars rolling over bodies as other victims in their last few minutes on earth
[00:49:41] vomited chunks of green. Some were visibly burning. Their skin boiling with bubbles.
[00:49:50] Others laughed uncontrollably an e-reside effect of the lethal chemical cocktail of VX, VX,
[00:50:00] Seren Taboon and mustard gas. That's a chilling vision. What kind of health was this guy in now?
[00:50:18] Was he scarred? Yeah, he definitely. He was well, it's looked normal but
[00:50:25] there was something about him. I can't put my finger on it but there was definitely something that
[00:50:31] that wasn't quite right. Fast forward a little bit. There's a section called the faces of evil.
[00:50:44] This is November 2014. Some ISIS soldiers will tell you that the reason they joined
[00:50:50] were simple. Straight forward woven into the web of basic survival money protection food.
[00:50:56] Other times the reasons to pledge allegiance to the terrorist group were complex,
[00:51:00] deep-seated in sectarian tribal and historical grievances dating back centuries.
[00:51:07] So what is war? War is a composite of individual stories and reasons. One rarely the same as the
[00:51:16] other. I pointed out the introduction that you asked this question over and over again more times than
[00:51:20] I read. Maybe that's the first time you asked to ask the question. But what's interesting about
[00:51:28] that answer to composite of individual stories and reasons. That's what this book is.
[00:51:32] It's like you're compiling all these different perspectives that people have, what they've been
[00:51:38] through and how they ended up here. Did you have that intent? When did this work that you were doing
[00:51:46] start to formulate in your head as a congruent story that you could put together in a book?
[00:51:51] It's something I guess. It's like most of this book was written handwritten in notebooks.
[00:51:57] So you can imagine how many of those are sitting in storage right now.
[00:52:00] But yeah, I think from sort of the first in 2014, I was trying to craft together how I wanted
[00:52:09] to weave these stories and how to make it a bigger story. And I knew that I didn't want to write
[00:52:15] something that was political, a policy driven or I just I didn't feel that that was my job as a
[00:52:21] journalist. I wasn't here to change laws. I wasn't here to to become or to be a court-on-quote expert
[00:52:29] in anything. My job was to tell a story. That was what I knew and that's what I knew that I could do.
[00:52:36] And so for me it was it was early on that I started to shape that idea and I didn't quite know
[00:52:41] how to put it together and then I guess around 20 and of 2015, I thought, you know, this is the
[00:52:48] approach I want to take with it. I really have to be patient because you're going to have to stick
[00:52:52] this out for a few more years. This isn't something that you can work on in finishing the next
[00:52:57] couple of months. So I had to give myself a good lesson, lesson in patience and just continue to
[00:53:04] just spend the next few years just going back and forth and spending as much time as I possibly
[00:53:10] could on the ground. And then I guess I felt that I had an and I could have kept going. That was
[00:53:15] the thing. I just I could have kept going. I could be there now and keep going. And still have
[00:53:19] these incredible stories. But at some point I had to realize, okay, you need to stop. And
[00:53:24] you know, there are other things you need to do there. The place is you need to focus, but there
[00:53:29] also has to be beginning and then into this. So yeah, I guess it was sort of 2019 that I decided that
[00:53:35] I think I had enough to put some together. But have you ever read Hiroshima?
[00:53:42] No. Oh, it's one of the most incredible incredible books about Japan and it was a journalist who
[00:53:49] had gone back and he was telling story, these individual stories decades after it. And it had such a
[00:53:54] lasting effect on me growing up and that was sort of, I guess, one of the biggest motivations in
[00:54:00] the style that I took with it was again that human cost and then just telling the very narrative
[00:54:08] story from as many perspectives as possible. And it's much detail as I possibly could as well.
[00:54:15] And I think that was something I wanted to bring out was it's those small details that make up the
[00:54:21] big ones. And I think it's the individual stories that tell a big picture. And sometimes we can
[00:54:29] look at statistics and we can look at the things that really distance us from a conflict because
[00:54:35] it's really easy to do that. You can say, okay, well, 200 and two people died in that suicide attack.
[00:54:40] But you tell a story of one person who died in that suicide attack and it's probably going to
[00:54:46] have a much more profound impact on you. And that's what I wanted to drive home was how the individual
[00:54:52] stories make up the big story. It's the micro in the macro. Yeah, that's very reflective of
[00:55:00] the way I will with this podcast. Of course, do we cover some big, you know, general patents
[00:55:06] books, yes, we do, but the majority of the books that we cover on here are written by a Lance Corp or
[00:55:14] Corp or a private that's out there in the front lines, carrying a machine gun. Because once again,
[00:55:21] when you're talking about what the general saw or what the general did, there's an altitude there.
[00:55:27] There's a lack of connection in many cases as to what actually is happening on the ground and
[00:55:32] what that looks like down there. So, yeah, you're effort to do that absolutely came through.
[00:55:39] And that example of the suicide bombing, yeah, I see a statistic of 222 people were killed in the
[00:55:44] suicide bombing. You can read that and you can move on. You can you can read see that headline and
[00:55:49] read, you know, what city was in and cool. You got the information you can move on.
[00:55:53] When you read about one of those victims, their family, how it's going to impact them,
[00:55:58] what mark it's going to leave, how they ended up there in the first place, what their goals and
[00:56:03] dreams were like, that's, that's the impact. And by the way, it's not always good.
[00:56:13] As is the case here with Omar, back to the book, Omar, 25 year old ISIS fighter from the Iraqi
[00:56:21] village of Dor Saladin admitted that during ISIS's first month in Mosul, he had killed scores
[00:56:30] of his countrymen and foreign contractors on their behalf.
[00:56:36] Quote, they came to our area and forced me to protect their lands. Omar said,
[00:56:41] flatly of his ISIS commanders, his thick monobrow remaining frightening still, a physical manifestation
[00:56:46] of the emotionless figure before me. After a while, they told me, when are you going to start
[00:56:52] protecting your own land? His eyes burning into mine, he went on to describe the words of his
[00:56:58] superiors. They told me to do it or die and then they killed people in front of me.
[00:57:05] By his count, he had racked up 70 executions in a matter of months. He mandated that he
[00:57:11] killed his victims with rifle shots and was chillingly candid about why he did it.
[00:57:26] Yeah, it's fascinating that you're sitting face to face with these these individuals.
[00:57:32] And obviously, you have a knack for getting people to talk because throughout the book,
[00:57:37] you're getting people to explain things to them to you that are either an incredibly painful
[00:57:44] or be incriminating like that. Somehow you're getting these people to talk at some very impressive.
[00:57:54] You'd be surprised how many people want to platform, you know, get them to talk and
[00:58:00] and often I think a lot of it came down to, they just hadn't talked to anyone for a while,
[00:58:04] so they were ready to talk to someone and they wanted to tell their story and you get them going
[00:58:08] for a minute and they're spilling their life to you because they've been locked up or whatever the
[00:58:15] situation is and people like to listen to themselves speak and that's what I've certainly found
[00:58:22] in interviewing a number of different jihadists and they want to talk.
[00:58:28] You say here, the facilities director of security noted that most ISIS fighters were uneducated
[00:58:33] and easily led down the grizzly path of violent jihad. Some regret their actions, some do not
[00:58:39] the guard said to me earlier, nonchalantly, understand that most are young and have no information.
[00:58:45] They are impressionable. They listen to the second life paradise story, 72 virgins, rivers of wine,
[00:58:52] and staying young forever. That is all they know.
[00:58:55] And you look, there's so many interviews in here with all these different people who you've
[00:59:06] got to get the book to read food them, they're powerful. I guess I got drawn into this section,
[00:59:13] a star spangled love. The notion of giving thanks to the Red White and Blue was not lost on the
[00:59:19] people of Kurdistan. The bald eagle, old glory and the almighty American dollar were king and the
[00:59:25] Kurdish part of Iraq. Most ethnic Kurds did not hide their affection for the US, a concept that
[00:59:30] had become rare in the predominantly anti-American throngs of the Middle East. Shopped,
[00:59:35] peddled American flags. US military gear was prized and the local spoke glowingly of the
[00:59:41] notion of the nation that they created with removing Saddam Hussein, the dictator who's heavy hand
[00:59:47] had so often come down on the minority group, clustered into the northern region.
[00:59:52] Imagine if America didn't exist, said a counten, Kurdot Amin Agah, whose home was outfitted with
[01:00:00] Israeli-American and Kurdistan flags and who wears a US Army shirt and a Navy seal watch.
[01:00:08] Without America, the world would be run by China or Iran. With dui eyes, he turned to me in earnest.
[01:00:15] America represents freedom he stressed. Our dream is to be eternally allied to America.
[01:00:24] You don't hear a lot about that. Yeah, that was fascinating. When you go, it was this little
[01:00:30] pocket of the Kurds in the North. They just loved, they loved both bushes, they, you know,
[01:00:38] it was just something that they just, they thought America was the ones to save the day.
[01:00:42] Yeah, I mean, you go in and talk about how you're walking through the, like the bizarre has
[01:00:49] red white blue has flags called this stuff in there, just pro-America, pro-freedom.
[01:00:55] And this is also interesting. Kurds who as a group are overwhelmingly Muslim also portrayed
[01:01:00] themselves as more religiously tolerant. Right now I'm working with Muslims, Yazidi Christians,
[01:01:06] we're all working together, said one high-raking KRG official. They celebrate occasions together.
[01:01:12] It's something very beautiful. I have friends who pray and friends who don't. That's not my
[01:01:16] problem. That is their choice. That is how the Kurdish people think about religion.
[01:01:20] On one early December morning, I saw several Kurds, busily setting up a deck, and decorating,
[01:01:26] Christmas trees. Whether it was done in a secular embrace of a foreign religious right or simply
[01:01:32] to make guess more comfortable is not clear. We're still new to this, a Kurdish hotel employee
[01:01:37] said with a smile, bickering with a coworker on how to decorate the tree, but we love it.
[01:01:46] Very tolerant. Yeah. Set-and-up Christmas trees. Yeah. During the, uh, after the 2003,
[01:01:55] a rocky vision, they marketed, they had an entire tourism marketing campaign called the other Iraq.
[01:02:02] And that was sort of how they would try to draw people in to come and visit them,
[01:02:06] was this other Iraq. They called themselves. So even though they belong to Iraq,
[01:02:11] they tried to be the other. So that was their kind of approach. Beautiful.
[01:02:18] Fast forward a little bit. That summer I drifted between displacement camps. The big ones and the
[01:02:25] small ones. The ones that were new only just established to accommodate the constant swell of newcomers,
[01:02:30] but ones that have been here for years as past wars melted into new wars. Over time the camps
[01:02:36] had burdened into little towns of their own, complete with banks and bridal stores and markets
[01:02:41] and places to buy home goods and sweaters. What is war? War brings resiliency. It is turning
[01:02:51] what feels like a prison into something of a home. What is war? War is running. It is not knowing
[01:02:57] what is on the other side. It is being unwelcome in your own home. It is being unwelcome away from your home.
[01:03:05] Sometimes war is walking too. One moment here and the next and some no man's land that you could
[01:03:12] that could never be home. It was drifting from place to place, both in mind and body.
[01:03:19] Crazy to think these camps are set up for so long that they become little villages.
[01:03:31] What is really sad is that so many of them still exist. Because I guess it is really out of the main
[01:03:38] headlines of the news now, the resources are just there is nothing. The likes of Bessie Murn,
[01:03:44] Gazelle, there are still camps just with nothing and no resources. It is almost even a war situation
[01:03:51] for so many of the displaced now. It was for them four years ago.
[01:04:01] You say here in a small camp designated especially for displaced Christians, a group of men
[01:04:06] looked me in the eyes and said certainly that they do not bother trying to read or watch the news
[01:04:10] anymore because it was all fraudulent, all lies. As you are hearing that, does that make you think,
[01:04:23] okay I have to tell the truth. I can only imagine hearing that from your perspective.
[01:04:27] Yeah, for them I think they just grown so frustrated. I think when you see such
[01:04:34] atrocities happen in the beginning, you really believe that there is no way the world is going to sit there and do nothing.
[01:04:40] I mean this is crazy. Somebody is going to do something, someone is going to stop this.
[01:04:45] And then you reach a point. A year in maybe it is 18 months in. When you realize it is not,
[01:04:52] well it is not that simple but it is just not the situation is not changing. And so for them I think
[01:04:57] that was just the acceptance that the news was never going to help them. Nobody was ever going to
[01:05:02] help them and so they come to that sort of group rationale of they mustn't be telling the truth.
[01:05:08] Because if they weren't telling the truth and this wouldn't be happening. If the world knew
[01:05:13] what was really happening, it would have been stopped by now. So therefore it must be all lies.
[01:05:21] How much do you think these stories get lost because of the short attention span of the world?
[01:05:27] I think very lost. I think very lost which is why I guess I wanted to try to put it at least together as
[01:05:35] one cohesive unit. The attention span is short but I think it's always been telling foreign
[01:05:44] stories has always been difficult. I talked to journalists covering walls in the 90s with,
[01:05:51] with Bosnia or in other places and they said the same thing. It was Princess Diana did something
[01:05:55] and it would take the headlines. And then for me it was sort of something would happen,
[01:06:00] Kim Kardashian breaking the internet and that would take the headlines. And so I think it's always a
[01:06:05] thing where no matter what error that you were in that foreign news unfortunately isn't going to
[01:06:13] always be at the top but that doesn't mean we don't report on it. That doesn't mean we don't give
[01:06:18] it resources. That doesn't mean we don't tell a story. And for me that was what I was drawn to
[01:06:24] was the stories that I felt needed to be told. Whether they have an impact or not that that is
[01:06:32] out of my hands but those voices deserve to be heard. This is a good segue into this section
[01:06:42] which is entitled Don't Forget Us. Early one morning I ventured further north to visit a
[01:06:53] Yazidi camp stuffed into the wedge where Syria, Iraq and Turkey converge. As it came into view over
[01:06:59] hilltops, a wash with a midst of equity. Err, I ascertained a sense of something profoundly exhausting.
[01:07:07] What struck me most was that unlike other camps where people animatedly voiced their anger
[01:07:12] and wailed about the lack of water sharing conspiracy theories about who was really behind ISIS
[01:07:18] and detailing what had happened to them in the flashes after they realized they could no longer stay.
[01:07:23] The Yazidis were so grieved that they said very little. They did not complain. They just looked at
[01:07:32] me with wide eyes that could brand even the most stoic of souls. They all spoke softly,
[01:07:40] repeating that they all they wanted was for their family members to return and for the chance to go home.
[01:07:45] Every single person had either lost a family member to death or disappearance or had been
[01:07:51] mained when ISIS assaulted their village less than a year earlier. It did not make sense for
[01:07:56] them to complain to complain would be a waste of their precious energy. I was escorted into
[01:08:06] a tent where a thin woman had burrowed herself into the corner, weeping silently into a black
[01:08:12] scarf, shoulders trembling. She was a survivor of sex slavery. She was alive but she was hardly
[01:08:21] living. More girls and women tipped toad into the tent behind me, nobody wanted to speak of this
[01:08:27] ordeal the notion of being touched. The term sex slave is a controversial one, many to cry,
[01:08:35] that it should not be used that it was not politically correct, nor accurate, an argument which I
[01:08:41] hear and understand. But I have chosen to use it because it is a term that many of the survivors
[01:08:45] and families use and because it's blunt and embedded in the reality that is not the reality that we want.
[01:08:53] Speaking of rape was taboo that terrifying within the closed and staunchly conservative Yazidi
[01:08:59] community, although the silence was slowly shifting. But there inside that suffocating space,
[01:09:07] the women held each other up, their embraces reassuring each other that they were now safe,
[01:09:12] if only for that moment in time. And at that moment in time I understood that the most valuable
[01:09:18] thing I owned was my 99 cent notebook with which I could try to capture the plight of these survivors
[01:09:24] in hopes that somehow they would not tumble from the world's oblivion. It was with my notebook
[01:09:30] that I could recall and write things these women taught me what it meant to be extraordinary.
[01:09:35] What it meant to be brave, what it meant to lose everything and still find the internal spark
[01:09:44] to go on.
[01:09:45] We'll get into more of the Yazidi treatment. I mean it's just a genocide slash.
[01:10:06] I mean the ISIS viewed them as Satan worshippers. Yeah devil worshippers.
[01:10:17] Other end of the spectrum. This section stood out to me. One evening I met emerging
[01:10:26] pop star, Haley love for tea and hookah in the lounge, hookah in the lounge of an ups of the upscale rotana hotel in
[01:10:35] Urbio. She was dolled up to the nines with long, perfect bleached hair extensions, fake eyelashes,
[01:10:41] red lips and strappy stilettos that clashed with her camouflage military pants and loose fitting white
[01:10:47] top. By recording techno-driven energy boosting tunes to increase morale and filming music
[01:10:53] videos in the direct line of fire, Haley was doing what she considered to be her part in the fight,
[01:10:59] standing vehemently with the soldiers and their will to win.
[01:11:03] Much had been said and speculated about Haley's personal life.
[01:11:07] And I wasn't quite sure what to expect but what I found was a true girl's girl. Underneath the
[01:11:11] hairspray and larger than life persona, Haley was a self-assured young woman who sought only to use
[01:11:17] her stardom and musical talents for something more than milking the Hollywood machine.
[01:11:21] I mean, some say I used to be, I used the Peshmerga to further my own fame but people were always
[01:11:27] complained she said bluntly in her sharply accented English, flicking a perfectly manicured hand.
[01:11:32] My country is bleeding and my weapon is my voice and my music and for those who have had their
[01:11:37] voices shot, I felt this was my only way of bringing their story, the story of the Kurdish people
[01:11:42] to the world.
[01:11:43] Haley love. I love Haley's love. She was born in Iran, became a refugee, ended up in Finland,
[01:11:56] from there, got put into a music school of some kind and then the lower of Hollywood got a
[01:12:05] holdover. She says this very quickly, I saw the E so she ends up in Hollywood. She literally
[01:12:11] was living in Hollywood. I think she got signed to one of the big labels, I think dream or one of
[01:12:19] those big producers had signed her and then what happens is you often get sort of shelved away
[01:12:25] and then she really really shelved away. The labels will sign you and offer you a deal and then
[01:12:33] they actually just don't you never get kind of to actually release and so once the contract is
[01:12:38] out, you can kind of move on. So I think I'm not sure of all her details but I think she
[01:12:42] was sort of brought over here and it was sort of starry eye and then nothing kind of moved and she
[01:12:47] really saw the end of the belly of of water what Hollywood was.
[01:12:51] Yeah, she said that she said I met some producers and realize that what they were offering
[01:12:55] an exchange to promote me was a lie. It was all about sex. It was shocking to me. I gave up
[01:12:59] on almost everything. She ends up cutting a couple songs over there. She says straight away,
[01:13:10] I received death threats from radical Islamic groups and the mollows at the mosque were insisting
[01:13:14] I was a bad influence and should be stoned to death. My life changed. I was the lying girl. I
[01:13:21] had all these fans and all the success but I had to contend with this too. You can watch
[01:13:25] your videos on YouTube and I'm definitely recommend checking them out. Yeah, something else, right?
[01:13:32] Even echo channels would be proud because she has a lot of explosions and she's filming
[01:13:36] notes. It's like, yeah, I literally I remember she was filming me and getting you know controversial
[01:13:41] some people agree some people won't but yeah, I says this is five miles or something down the road
[01:13:45] and she's filming a music video. Yeah, how cheat and you, this is one of the things I don't
[01:13:53] really trace but you trace the rest of her story. You go back and visit her at some point. Don't you?
[01:13:57] Yeah, so I went back and because yeah, I always wondered and I really, I really love telling
[01:14:02] when I met her and so I went back when I was in a meal and her name came up with a friend of mine
[01:14:08] there and she'd opened a beauty school or a sort of big beauty salon and everything's very
[01:14:14] pink and all the young girls go there for their, you know, their equivalent of the prom and get ready
[01:14:21] and and I think she'd really settled into that kind of life of being able to, to be in, you know,
[01:14:29] with her people and to do things in a really different way than she did in visions. So yeah,
[01:14:34] that was her way of, I guess, giving back in a new evolution was to sort of be the, the,
[01:14:42] the motivated for a lot of the, the young girls in sort of the next generation. Yeah, I thought
[01:14:46] that was, that was awesome. It's like she, she like, you always hear people going back to your
[01:14:54] roots, you know, go back to her, she straight up went back to her roots and she lives there now and
[01:14:59] pretty awesome. Yeah. Then she does have some pumped up videos. And she's gorgeous.
[01:15:08] I'm going to fast forward up to 2016. This brazen attack struck deep when no one was ready for it.
[01:15:18] There have been no intelligence warnings and ISIS suicide bomber detonated a checkpoint outside
[01:15:23] a small town called DB's near Kirkuk on November 3rd, 2015, allowing three fellow fighters to sneak
[01:15:32] through and temporarily commandeer a local government off office. The men were sentenced to hell
[01:15:39] and all died in the attack, but the ISIS bomb expert whose handy work sent them to their maker did not.
[01:15:46] Jacim Mohamed Atia was being held in a high security prison near the oil rich city in late
[01:15:55] January of 2016, the guard's let Jacim blindfolded into the room to meet me. What I did were
[01:16:04] terror acts Jacim, the 22-year-old said, matter of factly sitting handcuffed in the small office
[01:16:11] in the urbule headquarters of the of Asaya. It was my duty. There are infidel infidel's and there
[01:16:18] is instruction in the Quran to stop this and to fight all infidel's. The Kurdish security forces
[01:16:26] had nabbed Jacim weeks after the attack that slaughtered 14 Kurds and left scores more wounded.
[01:16:33] Three ISIS fighters had used the checkpoint bombing as a diversion to enter the city,
[01:16:38] then briefly hold themselves up in the mayor's office. The standoff ended when they opted to
[01:16:43] blow their own bodies to bits as police forces closed in. While that attack served as notice that
[01:16:49] ISIS was able to strike outside the territory of controlled, the one thwarted by Jacim's capture
[01:16:55] would have been devastating by comparison. The Kurdish security officials told me that Jacim
[01:17:00] had been preparing to rig a powerful truck bomb bound for urbule when he was arrested by intelligence agents.
[01:17:06] Jacim had cried like a big baby when he was seized. One intelligence officer recalled smuggly
[01:17:12] and had cried that all of them would be mad at him. The authorities relished any opportunity to
[01:17:18] take away the perceived power of ISIS members to bellow that these fighters were nothing more
[01:17:23] than pathetic, delusional con artist. The exact number of deaths caused by the exact number of deaths
[01:17:30] as Jacim caused, whether directly or indirectly remained unclear, he repeatedly gloded about
[01:17:36] conducting operations that killed and harmed scores of people, including the fighters he
[01:17:42] outfitted with suicide vests or put behind the wheels of vehicles rigged to explode. He was
[01:17:48] proud of his monstrous work and craftsmanship, but he was by no means ready to be a martyr himself.
[01:17:54] When I asked if he would have strapped a vest on of his own. I never thought of killing myself.
[01:18:01] I'm not convinced to kill myself. He said on apologetically, actually, I would leave or escape if
[01:18:07] they gave me this order. I wouldn't explode myself. That is another level of faith.
[01:18:14] He was unconvinced by the Mullahs' routine, espousing the paradise replete with 72
[01:18:19] virgins that don't menstruate or defecate. It's our leaders that make decisions Jacim said.
[01:18:27] Our scientists are scientists say that there are infidel people in Kirk Cook. It's not my decision.
[01:18:33] We are students and we listen to our teachers. If somebody pledges allegiance to ISIS,
[01:18:37] they must take orders and do whatever orders they get. They have to do it.
[01:18:44] I asked about the scientists and their theoretical determinations of infidel blood,
[01:18:48] but he didn't seem to know. Jacim had been taught not to question the scientists. If the
[01:18:52] scientists were really scientists. But at the top of ISIS of the Heises hierarchy was Abu Baker al-Baghdadi,
[01:19:00] who Jacim described as a good leader who lived as a simple soldier and who was just like everyone
[01:19:06] else. He had never met or seen the elusive self-professed ISIS Khalif.
[01:19:13] That's dangerous to meet him. No one can see him Jacim said. His eyes widening in surprise
[01:19:17] that even suggested such a question. It is prohibited for anybody to see him.
[01:19:22] Alternating between Bravado and circumspection brought on by either remorse or the presence of a
[01:19:28] watchful jailer, Jacim caused that he would have to be convinced not to go back to ISIS if you
[01:19:33] were released. Before I went to prison, I had no problems killing people. Now I have a bit of regret
[01:19:38] that maybe some people don't deserve to be killed. How long would you sit in a room with these guys
[01:19:47] for? I really depended. I think with him it was around about an hour or two hours. So...
[01:19:53] How would you select who you would you say, hey, who do you got?
[01:19:59] Yeah, I would usually talk to the gods about who was there, who was willing to talk. I always
[01:20:05] wanted to make it very clear to them. I was a journalist and their stories were going to be
[01:20:12] as they told them and they needed to be. It was difficult because in some cases they hadn't been
[01:20:18] brought to trial. So, you know, when they're saying these things, you know, and you haven't been brought
[01:20:23] to trial yet, you are incriminating yourself to a degree. And so I always wanted to be very
[01:20:28] fair and very clear that my journalists and what you say is going to be printed. So their willingness
[01:20:34] was obviously a big factor in them coming forward and telling this stories.
[01:20:39] Yeah, he also said it's better if they join. We want to go to America. We want to spread our
[01:20:48] ideology all over the world. You talk to another guy.
[01:20:56] I hear Sahib Jamel by his count, he had killed dozens of uninvolved men, women, and children.
[01:21:12] He says at the beginning, I says, told us we would all go to heaven. But now that I'm in prison,
[01:21:15] it means I am going to the fire. I am going to hell. The indoctrination was self-fulfilling
[01:21:21] fantasy script was evident, but any sign of real remorse was not.
[01:21:37] Real quick, when you interview these people, you mentioned that that one guy was blindfolded.
[01:21:44] You see blindfolded during the interview as well, are they? They take it off. Yeah, they
[01:21:49] blindfolded them and they bring them in so they don't really know where they are.
[01:21:53] You know, specific office or whatever they are. They take it off normally.
[01:21:58] I mean, he was, he asked a lot of articles on, but they took the blindfold off.
[01:22:04] That way you're just looking at them in his eyes when he's telling you all this stuff.
[01:22:08] At first it is. There's a little bit of a Walmart process and I found in a couple of the
[01:22:14] situations where my fixes would get very angry and I would have to ask them to leave or,
[01:22:19] you know, because often, you know, it's their relatives, you know, people that are being killed
[01:22:26] by these people and they're hate is so strong. Sometimes I felt that I'm not going to get a
[01:22:31] greeting if you're right now because, you know, you can feel that animosity and the reason I'm
[01:22:37] trying to get them to open up here. So, you know, there was that barrier I had to do with a little
[01:22:42] bit in the beginning and then I think as you sort of move into what you kind of get a,
[01:22:46] you build that rapport to a degree. They realize you just that to talk to them, to have a
[01:22:52] conversation, it's not, it's not my job to, I'm not there to interrogate you. I'm not there to, you
[01:22:58] know, to stick it to the man. I'm just there to find out the information. So, once I think they get
[01:23:06] used to me a little bit and then, you know, I get used to them a little bit, then it can
[01:23:10] become a little bit more of a conversation after that. Is it meant? Would you compare
[01:23:15] you know, like the doctors, like a surgeon or something like this and they got to cut some
[01:23:19] body open for you. Yeah, like for a normal person, they'd be like, oh, no, if I can't cut this
[01:23:24] person open. But then, if you're a doctor after a while, it becomes less of, oh, I'm cutting this
[01:23:29] person open more like this is like a, you know, like a specimen that I have to like work on kind of
[01:23:34] thing. Yeah, I think, I mean, there is, there are certain degrees of, that you have to
[01:23:38] can't compartmentalize. I think for me, I'm always very cautious of not wanting to do that too much
[01:23:45] because I think my, you know, what I'm trying to do is to, to really bring a different level of
[01:23:52] understanding on all sides of it and I don't want to be too distant. So, it's a fine balance.
[01:23:59] It's sometimes, you know, and sometimes I make it better than others, but, um, yeah, it's really,
[01:24:05] it's just listening. Often it's just listening. That's what it comes down to.
[01:24:09] Seems like after a while, this, like, all these stories might kind of jam you up.
[01:24:14] Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did get to that point a little bit, but I'd set boundaries on myself
[01:24:20] to recognize that I think, and yeah, I did get to that point.
[01:24:25] When you say you'd set boundaries for yourself,
[01:24:28] we'll get you a lot of the pieces that we could use in boundaries. So, I had, I had set
[01:24:33] markers on you for myself really, especially because I was, you know, spending so much time in the
[01:24:38] stories, we'd just get heavier and heavier and heavier and heavier and I would just be living in it,
[01:24:41] and I'd be living on a floor somewhere, and I didn't have a team, I didn't, I didn't have people around
[01:24:46] me beyond, you know, my fixes and who I was very close to, but I just knew that I, I wouldn't be
[01:24:54] able to do my work effectively if something, or I was hearing things that were really
[01:24:59] tragic, or something tragic had happened, and I didn't feel anything. And, and that, I think that
[01:25:06] moment didn't really come from me during this particular book. I had a couple of moments where
[01:25:12] I just, I felt very broken a little bit because I felt so helpless, and that happened during that,
[01:25:17] but I still managed to feel, you know, everything affected me, and I wanted it to affect
[01:25:24] me to a degree. And then when I realized I really need to take a break was sort of several years
[01:25:29] after, and it was in Africa and East Africa, and I'd interviewed a woman from the Congo who had
[01:25:37] had, you know, sexual violence, and she'd had these babies out of rape, and just what she went through,
[01:25:42] was so horrific, and she'd been shunned by her community, and she was running, and she was just
[01:25:46] the most extraordinary woman, and she was so, the name was Nancy, and she was so strong and amazing,
[01:25:51] and I just remember sitting with her for hours and with these babies, and having that feeling of,
[01:25:57] oh my god, I don't, I don't even feel this, I don't, I don't feel anything right now, and that
[01:26:03] really bothered me that I didn't feel anything, and so after that trip I went home, and I,
[01:26:09] I didn't go anywhere, I don't think for about six or seven months, because I just felt that,
[01:26:15] yeah, if I'd got to that point of just not reacting, that was not the point that I wanted to get to,
[01:26:20] and that's when you just have to take a break, and that's it. But I think, during the process of this
[01:26:27] book, and I talk about a little bit in the book, but it's often, you know, as a as a writer,
[01:26:34] I think it's an advantage because you're telling stories, and so it's almost cathodic, so people are
[01:26:41] telling you terrible things, and you have a way to release it out of your body, whereas I know a lot of
[01:26:48] my colleagues who have photographers or videographers sort of in combat, I think that they suffer more
[01:26:55] to be honest, and I've heard this from other journalists, because maybe they're not getting
[01:27:00] that same release that I get as a rasha, you know, may or may not be true, but that's sort of my
[01:27:05] experience with it, but I know, and I talk about in the book, and it's not always the most obvious
[01:27:10] things that I use the word break you, but it's not always, you know, digging up the mass graves,
[01:27:16] or seeing somebody be killed, or, you know, they're horrific things, but for me, they want the things
[01:27:23] that, you know, shattered me, the things were, and there's one that really sticks out for me,
[01:27:29] and that was in, in Xinjiang, in the city, and it had been completely destroyed, and a few of these
[01:27:34] very poor people had moved back to live in these houses where there was no water, no electricity,
[01:27:40] there was nothing, and because they couldn't afford to live at Camp Seven, and so I remember being
[01:27:47] there one day and there was a young father, and he had two young children, and he was just living
[01:27:50] in his old bummed-out house, even though there was nothing in there, and he said that he, they
[01:27:57] were easy, and he said that he's why I could be taking the children's mother, and that the
[01:28:03] captured her cold team and said if you give me X amount of dollars, it was several thousand dollars, then,
[01:28:09] you know, I would turn her, so this poor guy for months walked around and around the village,
[01:28:15] and everybody was trying to give him money, and he's selling his furniture, and, you know, doing
[01:28:20] whatever, and he finally comes up with the money, and then he calls the the captor and says, hey,
[01:28:25] I've got the money, and he says all of the prices doubled, and at that point, the man just gave
[01:28:31] up, he just gave up, he said, I can't, I don't have that, no one else was going to give me any
[01:28:35] more money, and so he's sitting over these kids, and I just, and that was the story that really,
[01:28:40] really cracks me because I felt so helpless, and I thought I can't even give you money, because
[01:28:46] I would be labeled as a, you know, giving, financing a terrorist regime if I did that, because
[01:28:52] they're paying ISIS to get their women back, but to him, that was, that was his wife,
[01:28:57] that was these children's mother, and just the fact that she's probably not even alive now,
[01:29:02] because he just could not come up with that money, and he didn't have the resources to do that.
[01:29:07] It was just, it was such a helpless feeling, and I, I couldn't help him, and
[01:29:13] yeah, that was the moment for me that I was like, this is, this is just insanity.
[01:29:18] This is ridiculous, and there's no reason that this should be happening.
[01:29:22] I think when you talk about the fact that writing the stories is an outlet, and it's something
[01:29:30] that I talk about with, even with, from the leadership perspective when I'm talking, the leaders
[01:29:35] about how to make decisions, I say, look, when you write something down, you are detaching from it.
[01:29:40] It's literally on a piece of paper outside of your head now, and now you can assess it from a different
[01:29:45] perspective. So I think that I totally agree that writing is therapeutic because you get it out of
[01:29:54] your system, and now you can see it on the page, and you can relate it from a different perspective.
[01:30:03] You know, and it's weird, you also talked about the, you know, at a point where you
[01:30:08] were in Africa, and you're interviewing this woman, and she's been through this
[01:30:15] absolutely unimaginable horror, and she's pressing on, by the way, and she's caring for it,
[01:30:21] and you feel like empty, and that's, you describe the Yazidis at many points, at many points of
[01:30:28] being in that zone where they just have no more emotions left because they've just gotten
[01:30:34] crushed at every single turn. And there was, there was one point there, and they're telling
[01:30:41] me the stories and showing me the pictures of these Yazidis babies that were being burned, and I just,
[01:30:45] I lost it, and you never want to lose it. You know, especially the journalists, you never want to
[01:30:50] cry, you never want to break down, and I just, I, I broke down, and I was just bowling in this room,
[01:30:58] and I just remember I looked up, and if somebody was handing me a tissue, they were all men in
[01:31:03] the room, Yazidis men, and was with one of their religious leaders. I just looked at everyone of
[01:31:09] those faces, and I thought, they didn't even want to just look at me, and he said, we just don't
[01:31:14] react anymore. And I just thought, this is just, it's such a, it's a place beyond a place that I
[01:31:21] can, you know, thank goodness, can never imagine getting to, or hopefully never would, but
[01:31:27] the depths of what they'd endured, the thousands of people from their community that had been taken,
[01:31:32] and, and just, it was so hard to even now to wrap my head around, but for them, it was just,
[01:31:41] there would be on the point of even reacting to any of it anymore, and they were just so lost,
[01:31:46] and so, so broken by it all that I just, nothing was triggering them anymore, and so
[01:31:53] here was I feeling terribly unprofessional and crying, but I just, I, I couldn't, I just couldn't
[01:31:59] stop, and it was just, yeah, that was a, probably the only time I've really done that, but that was,
[01:32:07] yeah, it was just a moment for me, of realizing that here I was feeling terrible, and they weren't even,
[01:32:14] as upset as I was, and then I had to really realize that they were suffering in a much different way.
[01:32:20] Yeah, you also mentioned in the book that at one point you felt like that, and then you kind of had to
[01:32:26] say, I'm a volunteer here, like I'm here because I want to be here, I can be sad, but they can't
[01:32:33] leave, this is it for them. Absolutely, and there's always a guilt that comes with that, and it's
[01:32:38] still something I grapple with. So I can go in and I can spend, however long I want to spend there
[01:32:43] months, weeks, whatever, and you get their stories, and you, you tell their stories, and then you get
[01:32:50] to go home, I get to get on a plane, I have an American passport, Australian passport, I go home, and
[01:32:58] they don't, they don't get to go home, they don't get to, they don't understand what, what that,
[01:33:05] that in itself being such a luxury, and there's a guilt that I, I feel with that sometimes,
[01:33:11] in just, in being that, and they don't view it that way, they view it as,
[01:33:16] why, you know, what a gift it is that someone would want to even come in and tell their story
[01:33:21] and would leave their comfortable home in their, you know, families and come and talk to us,
[01:33:28] and that's how they view it, which is lovely, but for me, it was always, yeah, a sense of
[01:33:36] of just filling a little bit of guilt about it, and I always tried not to be a vulture, I didn't
[01:33:40] want to go in and have somebody sort of open up and tell their story and then I, and then I take
[01:33:46] that story and I leave, and I don't know that it's ever, it's ever going to change anything for them,
[01:33:52] I don't know that it's ever going to do any good for them, so yeah, that's something I, I set with.
[01:34:02] What about the son ladies, tell us about the son ladies, because this is a cool story.
[01:34:05] It's a story extraordinary, so yeah, I heard about them and we went to sort of, we went for
[01:34:11] long drive to meet them and they were these extraordinary, easy women, most of them had come from
[01:34:16] Xinjar and, and so when, when I just came in in 2014, these, the easy, these had to flee up the mountain,
[01:34:25] because there wasn't anywhere to go, it was all surrounded at the bottom, and the tragedy of it was,
[01:34:30] so many of them died on that mountain because they stopped to death, it was a middle of summer
[01:34:34] and a rock in the summers, something else, but they stopped, and if they were describing, you know,
[01:34:40] having to throw children off the mountain, because that was going to be a better way for them to die than to,
[01:34:45] to die of stovation or dehydration, and that was really what's put in America to get back involved
[01:34:51] in Iraq was the Zidi plant, and the fact that of what happened to them was just in there was no,
[01:34:58] it was so hard to get aid and anything to them, so the women that survived that
[01:35:02] formed their own unit that they called the Sunlades, the first of the Sunlades, because they wanted to,
[01:35:09] I think, was multiple reasons, but they wanted to, to aid find their women that was still missing,
[01:35:14] and be they wanted to be involved in that in that liberation of getting their towns and villages back,
[01:35:20] and they were just really really extraordinary women.
[01:35:24] They also wanted vengeance.
[01:35:29] Yeah, as you would, as you would.
[01:35:34] Yeah, no, it's a very cool section in there that you talk about, and they also had
[01:35:43] real, real situation, I mean, I'll just go to the books, we have a lot of our women in
[01:35:52] Mazuel being held as slaves. Their families are waiting for them, we are waiting for them,
[01:35:57] the liberation might help bring them home, so they're in the situation, they don't just want
[01:36:01] revenge, they have actual people that they know, their friends, their relatives that are actual slaves,
[01:36:09] and they can go help them, and that's what they're trying to do.
[01:36:16] You say this when you're talking to them, but what I also had come to learn about the
[01:36:22] Yazidis was that when ISIS had already taken away their hopes and happiness,
[01:36:28] they would now allow them to take away their sanity too. The Sunlades were strong,
[01:36:32] always sitting upright, a few tears were shed, but hastily wiped away as the morning melted
[01:36:37] into afternoon. ISIS had abducted Yazidi girls as young as eight, trading them at the market for
[01:36:43] a few dollars. I learned of one young mother who was pregnant at the time of capture,
[01:36:49] she'd given birth in the back room of her overlord's home, but was not permitted to fruit feed
[01:36:54] her newborn son. The baby cried and cried. The Muslim militant beheaded him.
[01:37:06] The depth of the prairie video was hard to swallow, and we all sat and clouded quiet to it for a
[01:37:12] small period. It's important to us to be able to protect our dignity and honor a 19-year-old
[01:37:19] son lady named Mesa finally said, softly shattering the wencing silence. My family is very proud.
[01:37:25] They encourage me to join. I'm very proud to protect my people. After all that has happened to us
[01:37:32] Yazidis, we are no longer afraid. And as brave and stoic as the son lady seems to
[01:37:42] me there was one thing that did frighten them. The notion that Yazidi boys who had been kidnapped
[01:37:48] from Mount Sinjar and presumably drugged and brainwashed by ISIS were now fighting their mothers
[01:37:54] and sisters under the block flag of ISIS. We now have terrorist Yazidis something that never used to be.
[01:38:13] So, we hear about child soldiers throughout history, but this idea of which happened where they
[01:38:20] would capture these Yazidi kids that are 7-8-9-10 years old and brainwashed them and abuse them
[01:38:29] and turn them into extremist ISIS terror kids. And that's still a really big problem for them.
[01:38:43] Even, I guess, given the lack of resources, so a lot of the boys that are coming back are still
[01:38:51] still very radicalized in many ways. And I remember being in a refugee camp or a displacement camp
[01:38:58] for Yazidi's once in hearing just a horrific story about how one of the, you must have been probably
[01:39:03] 66-67 years old and he'd been rescued and brought back and tried to be a head-ease baby sister.
[01:39:08] Yeah, Zed, this is name in the book.
[01:39:29] Back to the book, one blazing summer after a night travel, the bumpy road of couple hours
[01:39:33] north to the office of kidnapped affairs. It was perhaps one of the saddest structures I ever entered,
[01:39:41] not because the building itself painted a bright sunny yellow and standing indomitable in the
[01:39:45] middle of a city sprawling, but rather because of what it represented. The office had been established
[01:39:51] with support from the KRG Prime Minister after the ISIS eruption of 2014 to help find thousands
[01:39:58] that had gone missing. I would visit that office many times in the months to come into every time
[01:40:03] it would get Saturn. You're talking to one of the individuals there, Zaina. Zaina explained
[01:40:12] that it was her neighbor's Muslim families that had lived side-by-side with for generations who
[01:40:16] ended up turning on them. One morning she said our neighbors came for us. Zaina, who was 32 years old,
[01:40:23] had spent more than a year as an ISIS sex slave. When ISIS came, they said they didn't want to
[01:40:28] fight us. They told us to give them their weapons, our weapons. She said telling me her story
[01:40:34] all over again, but this time faced a face where it felt cruder and more inescapable. We gave
[01:40:39] them everything we had. These were our Muslim neighbors, but so many of them had become ISIS and we didn't
[01:40:45] know. Zaina went, went as she recollected the day ISIS assaulted her village at the foot of
[01:40:52] Mount Sinjar. The elderly who could not run faster far enough were some of her executed.
[01:40:58] Men and women separated with older men dragged off to mosques to be killed. The females,
[01:41:05] including girls as young as eight were loaded onto cars and trucks and bound for Mosul.
[01:41:11] ISIS took me, my sister, my brother's wife, and my little sister. For 13 days we were putting a
[01:41:18] school. We didn't know what would happen. There were about 50 people, women, and children squashed into a
[01:41:24] room. There was no water for us to wash ourselves. The children were sick. Zaina had lied to her
[01:41:31] captors telling them that she was married, hoping somehow it might spare her from their evil intentions,
[01:41:36] that somehow it would save her from getting robbed of the one thing she could never get back.
[01:41:40] Her captors, however, were undeterred. She and dozens of others were taken to a heavily guarded
[01:41:46] building in the ISIS controlled Iraq City of Tallahafar. Yazidi girls under the age of 14 were
[01:41:51] whisked away and sold at auctions. The remaining women were handed off the ISIS fighters and told
[01:41:58] they were henceforth their property. When a fighter grabbed Zaina and Carter were off to
[01:42:05] into a dust storm fear paralyzed her from head to toe. In its official propaganda materials,
[01:42:12] ISIS justified killing, raping, and enslaving Yazidis calling them devil worshippers,
[01:42:18] and linking them to their mandate to re-institute, re-institute slavery.
[01:42:24] Raping them, those unbelievers, had become a core tenant of their theology.
[01:42:42] Zaina's angry impounders threw her into a prison cell. Days later she was transferred to another
[01:42:47] facility in Tallahafar and forced to convert to Islam onto the front of death. Zaina had already
[01:42:52] witnessed a dozen fellow Yazidis being executed and called blood as punishment for their escape attempts.
[01:42:58] She was not ready to die, but she was not ready to give up on finding her freedom. Zaina and her
[01:43:03] another Yazidi woman were sent to live with a gehaunist in the ISIS stronghold of Mazul.
[01:43:10] He took me to this place. They were flats, small tourist flats. It was a tourist community.
[01:43:15] He raped me. For the next five months Zaina remained inside Mazul and was handed off to another
[01:43:27] militant who locked her in a small room. This is how the game was played.
[01:43:35] Raping always been a weapon of war that thrived on silence, but the Yazidi community was
[01:43:39] bravely and gradually changing that notion. They were collectively bucking the mortification and the
[01:43:45] fright and all the repercussions that came with it to speak out and tell the world that they
[01:43:50] would not be muted. It's a tough situation Zaina admitted with a shrug, but I am still here.
[01:44:11] I am skipping giant chunks of the book as I am going through with different details.
[01:44:28] Evil. I think I write a fair bit in the book about sexual violence because I think it's
[01:44:36] something that doesn't. It's very uncomfortable to talk about and it's something that even now
[01:44:41] we're seeing ISIS fighters and not, no ISIS fighters are being held accountable for that.
[01:44:49] And there's still this mentality of the terrorist, they're killing people. So what do we care
[01:44:55] about that for? We need to start shifting that perspective. They need to be trialed for those crimes
[01:45:04] as just as important as every other horrific crime that they've committed because that's something
[01:45:10] that needs to change. I think for so long, I mean, it officially became illegal in 98.
[01:45:19] Sexual violence in wartime. It's something that's still relatively new. There's a lot of work
[01:45:26] that needs to be done in that topic and within the international community that needs to be looked at
[01:45:31] and how can that be sort of brought to justice? Otherwise, you do have that impunity that's
[01:45:35] going to continue. And what so many of these women go through, have gone through and in so many
[01:45:41] different conflicts, I think it really deserves a lot more attention than what it gets. But it's
[01:45:47] uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable to talk about.
[01:45:50] Fast forward a little bit here to Fouloujia. The city is damaged, but nothing like the other cities
[01:46:05] where ISIS has been dislodged, explained in Iraqi. I tell intelligence officials, we work closely
[01:46:10] on the Fouloujia campaign. This was a well-planned operation led by Iraq's Golden Division. The
[01:46:15] Golden Division was Iraq's special operations forces. It ultimately had been created
[01:46:23] by US-led coalition forces after the 2003 invasion and had received top-notch training.
[01:46:34] This is a local talking about the push through the city. And he said, if the decision was mine,
[01:46:42] I would have made a statue for every fighter in the battle against terrorism. Those heroes are
[01:46:47] examples of courage when faced with Daesh. It was awesome for me to watch, it was awesome for me to
[01:46:55] watch, as all this stuff was taking place. Obviously, I retired in 2010, but when we worked with the
[01:47:01] Iraqis, a lot of times, the Iraqi soldiers, they weren't very determined. And they would have a
[01:47:10] lot of hard times sticking to the fight. And we had an entire battalion one time leave the battlefield.
[01:47:19] And so that was not a great look, right? And so when I started getting reports back from my friends,
[01:47:30] that were in Missouri with the Iraqis and the Iraqis, we're fighting. They were fighting. And
[01:47:35] not just in Missouri, but in Ramadi in Foulouza, the Iraqis were fighting. And it was, it was so,
[01:47:41] that's kind of why I mentioned that. Because I had worked with some of the troops that trained
[01:47:46] up the Iraqi special forces, the Iraqi special special operations forces, and they did take the lead.
[01:47:52] And it was awesome to see their courage and that they were going in. They were fighting. They took
[01:47:59] massive casualties in Missouri. They took massive casualties. My friend told me that in the first few
[01:48:05] days, they thought to themselves, we're not, the Iraqis might run out of troops because they
[01:48:11] are taking so many casualties. I can tell you, when we were in Ramadi in 2006, they wouldn't have
[01:48:15] taken that many casualties because they wouldn't have continued to fight. They would have run away.
[01:48:19] And so here, they were fighting for a cause that they believed in. And it was awesome to see that
[01:48:25] taking place. And I really noticed also just in between 2014, 2019, just that trajectory and how
[01:48:32] much over that time, I guess that they were willing to win was really compounded. But yeah,
[01:48:40] by the end of it, they've seen some of the most terrific combat that you can begin to imagine.
[01:48:46] I mean, just the level of what they've experienced for those that have gotten through it is really
[01:48:54] remarkable.
[01:49:10] You know, I can't, there's some of these examples that you give
[01:49:14] of who this enemy was. I just, I just have to read them. Every day for three months, they
[01:49:25] tortured me as you're recalled from where he sat, stranded on the Syrian side of the shutter
[01:49:31] Turkish border. But after a while, the torture just became routine. He was one of the thousands
[01:49:38] of prisoners arrested by ISIS for so-called crimes like wearing Western jeans or smoking a
[01:49:42] cigarette. But he was also one of a select few who had managed to claw their way out of the terrorist
[01:49:47] groups, dungeons with all those limbs intact. Short of jail, liberated by opposing forces such
[01:49:54] escape were considered rare.
[01:49:59] And there's another one, Nazra, another former captive. ISIS told us we'll give you safety if you
[01:50:15] give up your weapons. But they lied to us, they took our weapons and they arrested us.
[01:50:22] Many of Nazra's fellow soldiers had since been executed, but many remained incarcerated. There was
[01:50:29] no rights or to attorneys do process trials or even a phone call. He estimated that as many as
[01:50:34] 2000 Iraqi armor soldiers had been slain since succumbing to ISIS over the past two years.
[01:50:39] He also estimated that 5000 at that time remained in prison battles across the country.
[01:50:48] The cages were so small, Nazra said that their tour sows were marked by the folds of
[01:50:52] skin and their limbs tinge blue from the hours of crouching, curled like a fetus in the womb.
[01:51:05] Women arrested by ISIS typically disappeared behind the prison's exterior held separately
[01:51:09] from the men and were often never seen again. Children are not exempt from the torment either.
[01:51:16] A large number of children have been arrested by ISIS. My friend, Hussom,
[01:51:22] a member of the Syrian activist group, Raka is being slaughtered silently. He explained
[01:51:28] the most common charges are insulting a law and cooperating with apostates. They are being
[01:51:34] tortured just like men and some of them have died under torture. They torture children too,
[01:51:38] mostly flogging, beating on the hands and feet and psychological torture.
[01:51:44] I was administered with electric shocks. My bones were broken. I was hung by my feet from the ceiling
[01:51:49] and beaten with my hands tied behind my back, said Ali. A professional in his mid-40s who had
[01:51:54] been arrested in the early days of the terrorist onslaught on suspicion of being an atheist.
[01:52:01] They swore on a Quran that I would be cut to pieces.
[01:52:03] You make a note here, you can take a life without killing. That's what torture does.
[01:52:25] Between the summers of 2015 and 2016, ISIS had been on a specially vicious rampage to
[01:52:31] compensate for the loss of seasoned soldiers and had taken to drugging those that radicalized
[01:52:36] or forced into its lair. ISIS is using special tablets. The fighters take drugs and they don't
[01:52:43] know where they are or what they are doing. They are just shooting and fighting. One Kurdish intelligence
[01:52:48] official explained. They lose their minds. Some can be shot 20 times before they go down.
[01:52:54] That ominous drug was known as Captain Gone. Is that right?
[01:52:58] A meth anthedamine like variant of the band pharmaceutical, threatened, threatened of falling.
[01:53:07] It was manufactured in copious quantities primarily in Lebanon and neighboring Syria,
[01:53:11] where it was sold to ISIS through middlemen. They removed any barriers you would have the fighting.
[01:53:21] There is no second guessing they just go out and kill.
[01:53:24] It's still a very common battlefield drug. Often comes from Lebanon, on Osseria.
[01:53:33] It's unfortunately, it goes beyond ISIS, but it's a very common drug that a lot of
[01:53:41] militias and even government soldiers are being given to give them that sense of invincibility to
[01:53:47] have them go out there and do whatever they're told. I think it really game prominence under ISIS.
[01:54:01] With little kids. Yeah. It's drugin' them out.
[01:54:09] Among the ranks of captured brainwashed and drugs, drugged were scores of Yezidi boys
[01:54:15] whose minds had been twisted to turn against their own people. They had been propelled into training
[01:54:20] regimes that included Islamist indoctrination and weapons instruction. They had been forced into
[01:54:25] learning the finer points of beheading forced into becoming suicide bombers and into serving as human shields.
[01:54:56] Did your perception of evil change while you were there?
[01:55:16] I think in the beginning, perhaps had a little bit more of a black and white
[01:55:22] perspective on it, especially in the US, we tend to sort of think
[01:55:33] which I think is completely wrong, but it always comes down to a religion thing.
[01:55:38] That always is often painted as the motivating factor. I think what I really learned
[01:55:44] was for people that were joining ISIS, it was really one of five things or one of 10 things
[01:55:53] that was motivating them to join. I think the complexities for me really grew in that
[01:55:58] because I suddenly started to see ISIS's absolutely evil and that hasn't changed for me.
[01:56:04] But what I started to see was the complexities of how they got to that point and why they joined
[01:56:11] and it wasn't so black and white really and that majority of them were joining more out of
[01:56:18] a necessity for survival than it necessarily was some kind of religious extremism.
[01:56:28] However, there was a difference between the ones that were coming far and as were coming
[01:56:34] and they were often a lot more extreme in that respect. What I found for the Iraqis in particular
[01:56:39] that we're joining was that a lot of them is ISIS had come in and taken over their town or their
[01:56:46] village and they still needed to feed their family. Those kind of complexities grew for me and
[01:56:55] it was a lot harder to look at things in such sort of black and white terms.
[01:57:00] Yeah, I think you're right that America definitely misses the point on that a lot.
[01:57:03] It was always, I still have conversations with people that will talk to me about or they'll
[01:57:12] come at me about, you know, we had no reason to be fighting the Iraqis and I was like,
[01:57:16] hey, we were fighting alongside the Iraqis. They were literally going into the same buildings with us.
[01:57:23] That's what they were doing. We weren't fighting against the Iraqis. We were fighting against the
[01:57:28] insurgents that were there. Same thing with the what you mentioned about, you know, how am I going
[01:57:36] to feed my family? There's plenty of 14, 17, 19, 22-year-old young male Iraqis that wanted money
[01:57:47] and how are they going to get money? Well, there's someone over here that's going to pay them
[01:57:50] $50 to go shoot NRPG at the coalition forces and that's what they're going to do and they weren't
[01:57:55] geodas. They were little hoodlums just like a little hoodlum in America. That's how you're going
[01:58:02] to make them a living in America in some crappy city where you don't have any opportunities. Oh,
[01:58:10] I'm going to be a drug dealer or I'm going to be a gangbanger because somebody's going to pay me,
[01:58:13] you know, to go and carry this from here to there. It's an economic decision more than anything else.
[01:58:19] And even when they're talking about, you know, if it's a religious thing, well, can't be a religious
[01:58:25] thing because we've got it's the actual Muslims fighting against the Muslims. It's not like there's
[01:58:31] there's it's not about that. And what the other crazy thing is, you know, when you talk to people
[01:58:37] and, you know, I would explain, well, you know, we were working with often times of majority,
[01:58:43] she, uh, army and it would be hard for them to interact with the Sunnis and people have no,
[01:58:48] but they don't understand what we're talking about. And that was a big bit, but you know, with
[01:58:52] ISIS, you know, you disband and, and entire, you know, the Sunnis were very dispensed and
[01:58:58] after a sedan and yet they still had their weapons in there out on the street and feeling, you know,
[01:59:02] persecuted by by the government and so what are they going to do? They're going to band together.
[01:59:07] There was the same people. It wasn't anything you. I think ISIS just sort of looked at as
[01:59:12] this group that came out of nowhere and dropped from the sky. Well, no, they, they were always there.
[01:59:17] Yeah, um, they just kind of came together at some point. When you mentioned Baghdaddy,
[01:59:25] Abu Bakr Baghdaddy, Al Baghdaddy, um, we, my task unit in Ramadi in 2006 went to go and
[01:59:35] capture a kill him, got a mission to go capture kill him and didn't get him. It's actually the,
[01:59:40] it's actually the opening story, life, life, bab and was the ground force commander on that
[01:59:46] operation. They got into a big gunfight because there was security there, which means he was probably
[01:59:50] in that vicinity. But you, you're right. Well, it's not, these aren't, they didn't drop from the sky.
[01:59:55] This was a guy that had been there and fought as an insurgent and was on the run and constantly
[02:00:01] trying to maneuver. And so yeah, these people didn't drop from the sky. And, you know, the other
[02:00:08] crazy thing that you can compare to a lot of bad situations in the world where what they want
[02:00:15] is there to be problems. So what the, what the insurgents want is to create division, right?
[02:00:20] Division and they would go and bomb she-a-mosks just to get the she-as to lash out at the Sunis and
[02:00:26] then the Sunis, they were, they were trying to create a civil war. And it was very, very hard to
[02:00:33] walk that line and make sure that you're doing this in a proper way. And even when we, in Ramadi,
[02:00:40] when we got there in 2006, I thought we were just going to do a big sweep through like we did,
[02:00:44] like like the Marines did in Flusha. Just go and rubble every building and just run through it.
[02:00:51] And Maliki, the prime minister who is a she-a knew that if he did that, it would be bad.
[02:00:58] It would be bad. And so he said, no, we're not going to do that. We're going to do it in a more
[02:01:02] sparing way as with minimal force required. And that's what we did. There was still force required.
[02:01:06] But it was a lot less kinetic than Flusha was. So yeah, I'll tell you, but all that being said,
[02:01:17] I, the, the, the evil that's perpetrated is just absolutely horrific and you capture it in this
[02:01:24] book. And what scares me the most about it is how easily people are swayed towards, it doesn't take
[02:01:33] much to push somebody over the line from being a normal person to be heading children,
[02:01:40] which is, which is horrific. And you know, I, I did one podcast on the, on the Me lie massacre.
[02:01:49] And there was roughly 500 old men, women and children, no military age males there at all.
[02:01:56] 500 murdered raped mutilated. And the reading the interviews with the guys that perpetrated this
[02:02:06] and you read their backgrounds and you read where they came from and you read what they did,
[02:02:12] you can't, it's, we have to be on the lookout for this kind of stuff because these guys
[02:02:17] committed heinous atrocities, equivalent of ISIS atrocities and the were Americans that had
[02:02:27] crossover the line. Absolutely. And I really think, you know, this is something I found in Afghanistan
[02:02:33] in Syria and Iraq and a lot of other places that we, when I say, we just don't give enough attention to
[02:02:40] and that is government corruption and how much of these things are a symptom of that.
[02:02:45] You know, if you have to pay someone every time you're going to go through a checkpoint,
[02:02:51] so that some policeman can line his pocket. If you have to, if you see your leaders rolling around
[02:02:57] within the, in these fancy cars and big houses and Rolexes and, and, and you're not, you know,
[02:03:03] you can't get by a sweeping industry and still not getting any services. Then at some point it's
[02:03:09] going to make you angry and when you're angry enough, I also think it's a big factor for, for joining
[02:03:15] a lot of these groups to sort of rise up against their own governments and I think it's something
[02:03:20] that when I talked to officials about it, they'll often took quick to throw up their hands,
[02:03:24] we can't do anything about that. That's just a systemic problem. Okay, but you're always going to be
[02:03:30] dealing with terrorism as a systemic problem from that problem because corruption is just such a huge
[02:03:37] driver of it. In every way, shape of form and I just think it's something that gets belly any
[02:03:41] attention when it's such a big reason why these groups exist and continue to exist and we'll
[02:03:49] continue to exist. Yeah, you have that, you have that little bit of anger in the back of your
[02:03:54] mind that you're being oppressed and then someone comes along and says, hey, you can fight that
[02:03:59] oppression with us and I'm in. Let's do this. Yeah. Fast forward a little bit. What does war look like?
[02:04:13] It isn't just blister buildings and empty brass casings and displacement camps. War looks like wounds
[02:04:19] and soldiers who don't resemble fierce fighters but are men in unfathomable pain.
[02:04:24] Soldiers belong to someone. They are mothers child. Someone created them and brought them into
[02:04:31] the world only for the world to rip them apart and for what was it worth it? It was always the
[02:04:39] question in my mind but ever the hardest to ask. Soldiers in medical staff, you're going to
[02:04:49] into a hospital. Soldiers in medical staff face a fight of a different kind. No money and no
[02:04:55] medicine to treat almost 9,500 that have been seriously wounded. The tiny hospital, if one could even
[02:05:01] call it that had no MRI equipment or CT scanners, it reminded me of poor clinics of a Soviet time in place.
[02:05:10] There were thousands of open, unresolved case files, several soldiers, young faces, old faces
[02:05:14] and with body parts gone gone, came forward to outline their predicaments and pain to reconstruct
[02:05:20] the blows to their bodies. I feverously jotted down all I could in my friend notebook.
[02:05:29] And you go through just talking to soldiers and their horrific wounds that they're
[02:05:36] you know, Powwana ishmail. Been defusing a roadside bomb for Teshmerga on Christmas Eve in 2014
[02:05:44] when it exploded. His two comrades died, much of his body was burned and his thigh skin had been reduced to
[02:05:49] ash. Carwans side 37 years old, proudly dressed in his soldiers uniform. He's one of the victims of the
[02:05:59] ISIS chemical attack. Kiter Merckor 42 years old, 25-year-old Peshmerga servicemen,
[02:06:08] ambushed by an ISIS vehicle, around from a PKM machine gun cleaved below his left ear
[02:06:16] and lodged a few millimeters from the top disk in his back. The round remained there infected
[02:06:21] and inflamed. His hands were numb. His head ached persistently. Bazaar who sane, 32-year-old,
[02:06:31] been working on the front lines, struck by a sniper's bullet in broad daylight,
[02:06:40] reduced from a strong able-bodied man to an almost infantile, physical and mental state
[02:06:45] who sang could no longer control his legs. Nor could he control his head. And I movement
[02:06:49] occasionally he could speak slowly other times. His eyes just swelled with confused tears as the words
[02:06:56] would not come out.
[02:07:01] These men had been robbed of bones and body parts that could not grow back, some had lost their
[02:07:19] minds, but none had lost their self-respect. They were heroes who did not look like conventional
[02:07:25] heroes, but constituted what the Hollywood depiction of heroes should have been.
[02:07:38] And once again to your earlier point, Hollywood, when you read 40 were wounded or 12 were wounded
[02:07:46] or 7 were wounded or a thousand were wounded, the way you did and I just breezed through those.
[02:07:53] I didn't go into the detail that you go into some of the backstory, but every one of those little
[02:07:58] statistics is a person.
[02:08:11] Going back to Tallah Far. This is a, uh, here's a tactic. When the people came, when the people
[02:08:20] from town heard that Kirkuk had been taken over by ISIS, many came out to the streets to celebrate.
[02:08:25] So this is what we're talking about. You got people that you got the Shia power and you've got
[02:08:31] ISIS taking over Kirkuk and now the Sunnis come out and see, yeah, let's celebrate and then what
[02:08:36] happens. With all the families out in the street, ISIS members then executed their scheme and had
[02:08:40] the trucks ready and filled them with young boys and imported them to the front lines.
[02:08:44] ISIS has used all sorts of tactics and human shields many times before.
[02:08:53] ISIS was using the young boys for three main functions, functions on their fate full front line
[02:08:59] as direct fighters as human shields and as suicide bombers.
[02:09:06] One soldier showed me a video of the remnants of a cotterized truck and told me the three
[02:09:11] inside were just kids taken from the Tallah Far streets just a day earlier.
[02:09:24] What is war? War is the reason you wake up. There is no life outside of the conflict.
[02:09:28] You eat and breathe. When you're in it, it is impossible to have a life outside or even to if you
[02:09:34] attempt the rich willistic movements of daily life. The soldiers I met may have had their family
[02:09:41] but war always came first. It was not a choice. They had no option but to live it and breathe it.
[02:09:48] They had all abandoned their studies or deserted their livestock or quit their jobs to defend
[02:09:53] their people for a poultry paycheck, a paycheck that often did not come on time if at all.
[02:09:58] There was no time for anything but war. How often are you going in and out of country during this time?
[02:10:19] L.S. counter the amount of trips. Would you normally stay for a month?
[02:10:24] Yes. Some points in a trip for a few weeks. I often left it very open and depending on
[02:10:36] getting what I needed. I would go to other countries in between it all. I was going to
[02:10:45] cover other conflicts at the same time and then I would go back. I'd spend a chunk of time
[02:10:51] back in the US and then go back and spend a chunk of time. I would just whatever I could get that.
[02:10:57] I felt I needed to go back for and then it was a very obituary to how long I thought I needed to be
[02:11:07] there. Is there any of your work driving this? Is there stories that you owe or anything like that?
[02:11:16] Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. No. Nothing sort of pragmatic in that sense. It was more
[02:11:21] or yeah. It was more just trying to develop it as it needed to be, I guess, in that very organic sense.
[02:11:31] We've talked about the sun ladies. We've talked about some. I think we've talked about some of the
[02:11:36] other Peshmerga females. There are females on the other side as well.
[02:11:43] Females of the Caliphate. I got 15 years one plump 54-year-old woman said flopping onto the office
[02:11:55] couch for being an ISIS terrorist. I wanted to be a suicide bomber. You refer to this female as
[02:12:04] KS. KS wanted to tell her story in a jagged timeline, a biography bound by battles. She was the
[02:12:10] daughter of an Arab father and a Kurdish mother. She grew up speaking her grandfather's language of
[02:12:16] Turkmen. She ended up in ISIS after her marriage fell apart. I wanted to divorce. I was very poor.
[02:12:23] I have schizophrenia and was just diagnosed with blood cancer and my only daughter wasn't treating me
[02:12:29] well. I was borrowing money from people for the treatment KS lamented. I was welling. But then I
[02:12:35] grew desperate. In the obscure days after Mosul, I was snatched. Oh, after Mosul was snatched by ISIS
[02:12:42] in June of 2014. When the terrorist group was quickly capturing territory across Iraq,
[02:12:47] she had detailed her situation to a cab driver named Machmood in her home city of Kerkuk.
[02:12:54] He offered her a solution. He was ISIS instead of I joined they would treat me well and pay me.
[02:12:59] I said I would join on one condition that they make me a suicide bomber and get me out of my misery.
[02:13:07] The only thing I was seeking was to be bombed and die. So again, you were pointing out
[02:13:17] who becomes ISIS and why? And there you go. Here you have someone that skits a frenic has all these
[02:13:22] problems in their life and you see the same thing in cults in America. You take someone that's
[02:13:28] been abused. You take someone that's down on their luck. And that's who cults actually go after.
[02:13:33] They go after people like that for the most part. And this is a classic situation.
[02:13:38] Psychological issues, divorce, being treated bad by her daughter, there you go.
[02:13:48] Yeah, and she, you know, in the when I was sitting with her and she's sort of
[02:13:51] vacillating between this laughing and crying and it was all, it was all very bizarre but I talked
[02:13:57] in length with one of the guards that was in the river at the time when she was telling me
[02:14:02] her story and you know, she sort of panning herself to be this very innocent person but
[02:14:07] as two sides to the story and the other side being that she was really evil and she was one of
[02:14:13] the people that was taking these easy women and helping facilitate them to be sold and
[02:14:19] debating them and things. So, you know, it's just a very complicated situation in that.
[02:14:32] Colonel Marwan, sobriety of the Yazidi, Peshmergobitain recalled that in March 2017,
[02:14:38] a disillusioned American, moving from females. This is to Westerners amongst the ranks.
[02:14:43] A disillusioned American surrendered himself to the Peshmergobitain. He had begged them not to
[02:14:51] shoot him. That fighter turned out to be 26-year-old Mohammed Jamal Kuis from Virginia,
[02:14:59] who was later deported to Virginia's eastern district for indictment.
[02:15:02] A 20-year-old jail sentence handed down October 2017 awaited him. And you go through some of these
[02:15:14] other Westerners, males, females coming in from first world countries, coming in from America,
[02:15:23] coming in from parts of Europe to go, giving up as crazy. Crazy.
[02:15:28] They were their recruitment campaign for foreign as was pretty extensive.
[02:15:39] Moving forward into the book, all tools in the war against ISIS had eventually pointed to
[02:15:44] Mosul. It was the ISIS-Bredden butter, the head of the snake. I learned that many Mosul civilians,
[02:15:52] innocent souls who had managed to survive over three years of ISIS occupation were slaughtered
[02:15:58] in retaliation as Iraqi forces around the city. To have made it this far, just to be taken out
[02:16:05] in the twilight of the fight jarred me. Their body parts were strewn across dusty streets.
[02:16:12] Tiny bodies cracked open, left to die after their fleeing parents were gunned down,
[02:16:17] some hiding underneath the bloody corpses of their family members, orphaned and forever traumatized.
[02:16:23] I remembered the house of a broken woman. Her little daughter had been lost for days,
[02:16:31] until she was found with nothing but a gaping black hole where the back of her head used to be.
[02:16:40] Suicide belts are strapped on to helpless civilians, including women and children by ISIS,
[02:16:44] a crime of the Iraqi counterterrorism forces conjectured. This was a big dilemma. We didn't know
[02:16:54] who a bomber was and who was not many of our men died from these people forced to be bombers.
[02:17:03] This is one of the things that when my friends were over there and they were reporting back,
[02:17:09] they'd have these kids, women, children, men coming to checkpoints with strapped with bombs.
[02:17:19] The predicament that they were in, but then also the great lengths that the Americans made
[02:17:27] to try and spare the lot. You normally do with a suit. Obviously a suicide bomber. What do you
[02:17:33] do? You can kill them. What do you do with a roadside bomber and IED? You blow it. What we do?
[02:17:40] We call it blowing in place. You just go put a explosive charge near it and you blow it up and then it's
[02:17:44] safe. What you don't want to have to do, you do have to do it sometimes, but you don't have to go
[02:17:49] there with whatever, like an action movie with a pair of pliers and a wire cutters and actually
[02:17:56] disarm that thing because it's dangerous. By the way, the way they build those bombs often times
[02:18:01] when you cut one wire, it's rigged to blow up and that somehow causes detonation anyways.
[02:18:07] So what they had in many of these cases were these kids or innocent people that had these bombs
[02:18:13] strapped and go walk into the checkpoint. It's not like complicate and it's
[02:18:23] that there's no easy solution to that. Yeah, you know we talked about on a few podcasts ago,
[02:18:29] we talked about the idea of total war, which is at the far extreme of conflict, right? Total war.
[02:18:36] We will do absolutely any. And you asked me echo Charles, you asked me,
[02:18:40] give me like as any examples of total war and I said, ISIS. There was no boundaries,
[02:18:46] zero boundaries to what they would do. I mean America, pretty much always operates in some
[02:18:53] there's some cap. Now you could say World War II, once we dropped the atomic bombs, it was like,
[02:18:59] hey, this is total war and we are going to do whatever it takes to win as quickly as possible.
[02:19:04] That's how you can make a decision to say, hey, we're going to drop these atomic weapons.
[02:19:11] But other than that, you know, there's always rules of engagement, there's always Geneva
[02:19:16] convention, there's always all these constraints, but if you want to talk about just total war,
[02:19:19] we will do absolutely anything to and stoop to any level of barbarity to try and achieve victory.
[02:19:26] This is an example.
[02:19:34] Female ISIS members were said to have stoop to weaponizing their own babies, seemingly harmless
[02:19:40] mothers carrying their babies had been trained to enter areas thick with Iraqi soldiers only to blow
[02:19:45] themselves up their young and their liberators around them to bits.
[02:19:53] An enemy is most dangerous when on the defensive or when they are fighting for survival.
[02:19:57] This was not an easy fight and ISIS was not the JV team. ISIS did not care for rules of
[02:20:03] engagement by which the West was taught to fight. ISIS did whatever it would take to achieve
[02:20:08] its strategic objectives regardless of the consequences. There you go, you and me on the same page.
[02:20:18] President Trump gave a free hand to his then defense secretary Mattis who in May stressed military
[02:20:25] commanders were no longer slowed by Washington decision cycles or by the White House Micro Managing
[02:20:30] that existed with President Obama. As a result of the new approach, the fall of ISIS and Iraq
[02:20:36] at least in terms of territory came even more swiftly than hardened US military leaders expected.
[02:20:42] It moved more quickly than at least I had anticipated Brigadier General Croph said,
[02:20:48] we in the Iraqi security forces were able to hunt down and target ISIS leadership,
[02:20:52] target their command and control.
[02:20:56] So I kind of heard that a lot from the leadership when I was interviewing them,
[02:21:01] I think that was in the end of 2017 and that was sort of the recurring theme was that they
[02:21:07] were given a more of a free hand and they were sort of able to push forward. I could look at that
[02:21:12] in hindsight in many different ways and how that could be interpreted. But that was the narrative
[02:21:21] on the ground that the end of 2017 was that they felt that they were given more support than they
[02:21:26] had been in the past. Yeah, I think that and it's also very interesting when you look at the fact
[02:21:32] that this is General Mattis, right? This is General Mattis who's saying this and obviously
[02:21:39] General Mattis and President Trump in the end were not friendly, which it shows you how
[02:21:47] very caustic Trump's leadership could be or could become if you, you know,
[02:21:53] caustic. And it didn't start out that way clearly. You know, at some point they were seeing
[02:21:59] out of why. It's what I love about this and what I what I, is this is decentralized command.
[02:22:06] This is saying, okay, listen, I'm the president. There's bad guys there. I don't care what you do.
[02:22:11] What I want them, I want them gone. I want that that problem solved. Commanders on the ground.
[02:22:16] Okay, we're going to go solve it. Yeah, that's what I said to go solve it. That's, that's a great
[02:22:21] sign, right? That's a great sign. And obviously, I guess the disease of victory is General Patent
[02:22:28] used to call it meaning, hey, we won this thing now. Everyone should just listen to me more. I mean,
[02:22:34] that's that's what you have to watch out for. You can't let your ego make you think that just
[02:22:38] because you made one good decision, you're going to make all good decisions. It doesn't work that
[02:22:43] way, but this is just again, very revealing of how confusing Donald Trump's leadership could be
[02:22:53] that you could have that he could have completely empowered General Mattis to go and solve this problem.
[02:23:01] And then, a couple years later, General Mattis leaves. Yeah, and I think it really started that way
[02:23:09] with a rock with Afghanistan. Go do what the job needs to be done. And my understanding from
[02:23:14] talking to different people at the White House the time was that President Trump, you, he's not,
[02:23:20] you know, he is the commander of chief, but was the commander of chief, but isn't a military guy. So he
[02:23:25] kind of, he gave that job to the generals to do. And then at some point, I feel like that shifted.
[02:23:33] And the love that he sort of had for the men, then somehow sort of changed. I'm not entirely
[02:23:40] perry to what happened there, but there was definitely a shift at some point. Yeah, it was all very
[02:23:46] strange to watch from the outside. General McMaster is another guy that was on his staff who is
[02:23:54] from everything I understand I've never met with him. I've never we've covered some of his stuff
[02:23:57] on this podcast because he's very risk from everything I've understood. He's one of the most
[02:24:05] respected guys. He worked up in Tallah Far. My brigade commander when I was in Ramadi had relieved
[02:24:12] him in Tallah Far. He had done an amazing job in Tallah Far. Bringing stability to that city. We
[02:24:18] use that plan in Ramadi. So McMaster is just a very well respected and he was gone. General Kelly,
[02:24:29] same thing. I mean, just a Marines Marine, whose son was killed in Afghanistan. And he ends up.
[02:24:40] So you're sitting there. It's causing a lot. It's very, it makes it, it's obvious that it's very
[02:24:44] hard to logically track the fought patterns of President Trump. You can't really just, there's
[02:24:54] some inconsistency there that you just, it's just confusing. But at this time, it was very clear.
[02:25:01] This is another great, on another thing that is very positive. It says here, we really had one mandate
[02:25:07] and that was tenable for Iraqi security forces to defeat ISIS militarily here in Alambar.
[02:25:15] I feel we have achieved that mission. Folsom said, I never felt constrained in a lot of ways.
[02:25:21] I felt liberated because we had a clear mandate and there was no questioning that.
[02:25:27] We were able to focus on what our job was without distraction. And I think that goes a long way
[02:25:32] in what we were trying to accomplish. So that's another thing. It was a very clear mission.
[02:25:38] And I'm sure General Mattis drove a lot of that to say, okay, what do you want us to do?
[02:25:47] Because if you don't have a clear mission, well, I mean, I do, I mean, say anything.
[02:25:53] If you don't have a clear mission, what are you trying to do? Yeah. And that mission was
[02:25:58] defeat ISIS and it became very complicated, I think, because everybody wanted to argue,
[02:26:04] well, what does defeat ISIS mean or people thought, well, if we leave Syria, then that leaves
[02:26:10] it open to all sorts of other things. But in Trump's mind, I think it was clear. It was defeat
[02:26:17] ISIS militarily at least. Not defeat the ideology. I'm not necessarily, I think that's going
[02:26:22] into a whole different rabbit hole, but in terms of territory, arguably yes, that was something
[02:26:31] that was achieved. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And killed a lot of them. Tens of thousands of ISIS fighters
[02:26:40] were killed. I'm going to fast forward a little bit. You talk from everything, like I said,
[02:26:53] you're effort to capture many different perspectives and one of the one of the perspectives
[02:26:58] that you capture in here is of the Iraqi Christians. And I had to read this part, because just
[02:27:04] because it's very moving. Scores of Iraqi Christians in the region who earlier fled in fear,
[02:27:11] neighboring countries such as Jordan Lebanon, Turkey weren't much better off. Father Afram said,
[02:27:17] I'm going to send that name right Afram. They had waited years for visas to Western nations,
[02:27:24] only to be rejected. Now the refugees were stranded. They did not have money or the Kurds to
[02:27:29] resettle in other pockets of Iraq. Those fortunate enough to have been granted visas had to watch
[02:27:34] their families be split apart. Some members lived in the US, others in Europe, and still others
[02:27:40] were strewn across the Middle East. What is war? It was options, almost all bad.
[02:27:47] This war ever bring about options that could be considered good. That sense of helplessness
[02:27:52] hung in the air. During Sunday's service, women in aphodic,
[02:28:00] mantillas, saying and prayed, and the men stuck struck candles to elume the dark in space,
[02:28:06] while tiny children played outside in the cold sunshine. Icists destroyed all the crosses,
[02:28:13] crosses that have been made 150 years ago. Father Afram said,
[02:28:18] but I said to my people, make new crosses. You note in here, again, you have a couple modes,
[02:28:33] and I'd say 10% of the book is sort of history, slash facts. It's a gift's context around one of
[02:28:41] the history lessons that you give us is that in 2003, as the Americans invaded for the first time,
[02:28:51] into Iraq, there's 1.5 million Christians. In 2019, there's 200,000 Christians in Iraq.
[02:29:03] Yeah, and there's two sort of very different schools of thought. I think in that is that
[02:29:06] one being a lot more effort should be made to ensuring that they do stay. That's the land,
[02:29:15] that's their homeland, Iraq essentially. So that all the second thought being, they're going
[02:29:22] to continue to be persecuted, regardless of whether it's ISIS, whether it's government, whether
[02:29:27] it's an al-Qaeda, irrespective of that their lives are in danger. So everything needs to be done
[02:29:34] to sort of bring them out and have them resettled in Europe or the United States. So this two
[02:29:40] kinds of skism, I think, in that community because there's just two very divergent thoughts on what
[02:29:45] the better alternative to that is. Help them stay or help them live.
[02:29:50] Oh, hold section here, ISIS wives, infighting jealousy and regrets. And this is where, you know,
[02:30:04] you started, I didn't dive too much into it. You said, you were talking about the recruitment
[02:30:10] system that they had in Europe and I kind of moved past it. I didn't mean to ignore that, but it's
[02:30:15] just that you addressed a little bit more here. Lena Frisler was a 28-year-old blue-eyed
[02:30:22] blonde with milky pale skin from Hamburg, Germany. She was once an aspiring business student
[02:30:27] with European dream of money, travel, family, and success. In 2012, she married converted to Islam
[02:30:33] and left the comforts of her home for Turkey. She said that she had made the abrupt decision
[02:30:38] after being cordured and encouraged by a known radical solifist in the Hamburg area. She called
[02:30:44] him Pierre Vogel, who urged others to rise up and fight against the Bashar al-Assad Syrian regime.
[02:30:52] Her husband also came under Pierre's spell. One day, my husband came home and told me he wants to
[02:30:58] go to Syria and fight. Lena told me matter, faculty as she nursed her one year's old son,
[02:31:05] her second child with an ISIS fighter. And that goes back to what I said earlier with the government,
[02:31:13] the corruption, how much of this is the symptom of that big problem that we tend to ignore.
[02:31:18] And that's what I found a lot with these women and these fighters that was especially the foreigners.
[02:31:23] Yes, some were going very specifically to join ISIS, but there was a sort of whole group that
[02:31:28] went before ISIS was even a thing. And their mandate was to go and fight Bashar.
[02:31:34] And so I think that sort of we tend to overlook how much of a symptom, you know, it is of a government
[02:31:45] problem. Another germinated of a stunning raven-haired 26-year-old named Heidi Raufi told me she
[02:31:56] spent most of her day as alone in the 10. She said she had fallen in love with an older boy in 2009,
[02:32:02] then several years in a relationship he informed her that he was going to help the people of Syria
[02:32:07] that were suffering as a result of the war and Bashar al-Assad. Love struck Heidi ditched her
[02:32:12] social network, her social work studies for a life of a Jihadi wife in 2014.
[02:32:20] Her beloved Korean later died on the battlefield. She remarried.
[02:32:25] Here's the remarrying. It was an easy process. There was just, there was an ISIS man.
[02:32:28] We all knew with a laptop and he would just ask us what we wanted and bring us guys to choose.
[02:32:34] I met three but chose a man from Kosovo blinded by Shrapnel because he wanted to go to Turkey
[02:32:38] for an operation. That was my out. So she was trying to get out now. She never made it across the
[02:32:44] border. Months dragged on. She wanted to return home to Germany. I wasn't love. It was on the stake.
[02:32:52] And often in these women when they tried to get out, they'd get money. Someone from home would
[02:32:56] send them money and they'd pay what they called a smuggler or whatever to get them out.
[02:33:00] This smuggler would just take the money and drive them around and around and a few circles and drop them back.
[02:33:05] It sort of became this hotel California. You go in but you can never leave.
[02:33:12] So that was sort of the recurring theme with the women. I found too that even if they wanted to,
[02:33:17] they couldn't. Colah Ahmed, a 43-year-old, departed Karachi Pakistan with her husband,
[02:33:26] and children of fight for the Syrian people. My husband was distraught after seeing a unicef
[02:33:31] documentary about the war in Syria. He wanted to go fight Bashar. My husband sold our house and
[02:33:37] all our things for us to leave. He used to be a normal man, work in telecommunications,
[02:33:42] but he saw that documentary and he made it mind to change.
[02:33:47] And like you've been saying, that's what kind of underlying issues were in his head.
[02:33:59] What's going on? Could he not get ahead at work? Was he not getting the support that he needed? What was going on?
[02:34:07] You have to add in all these other factors.
[02:34:09] Another one. This is a male born to Moroccan parents and the idyllic countryside just outside
[02:34:24] of Brussels. Homsa was well known in his community, revered for soccer and boxing skills. His last
[02:34:28] job was with DHL, delivery service. Homsa admitted that in 2011 he became more militant in his
[02:34:37] ideological views after being introduced to a solid fist group called Sharia for Belgium.
[02:34:44] The group called for the overthrow of democracy and urged young people to join ISIS abroad.
[02:34:49] Almost two years after he headed, he did the call and set out for the battlefield. The
[02:34:53] organization would be formally designated as a terrorist group by the Belgian state.
[02:34:58] Homsa was first place at an immigrant's location in the opposition
[02:35:02] bastion of Idlib where he was housed alongside several western fighters. After two weeks he
[02:35:09] spent, he was sent for 40 days of training. Weapons, fitness, religious doctrine. After that he
[02:35:15] was deployed to the northern city of Alepo to fight. I just wanted to give people some kind of
[02:35:23] indication. Homsa, particularly remember the ISIS celebrations after the 2014
[02:35:30] be heading of American journalist James Foley and how leaders used the gruesome event as motivation.
[02:35:36] It was to say, look how we are fighting the Americans. He continued underscoring that ISIS
[02:35:42] initially gained momentum after the formation of a coalition of over 60 Allied nations designated
[02:35:48] to defeat them. Designed to defeat them. The coalition's creation was spun by the ISIS propaganda
[02:35:54] machine to show how strong the militant group was against such a massive force. Homsa repeatedly
[02:35:59] emphasized in the interview that the ideology driving ISIS was not going to stop and had permeated
[02:36:06] some circles so profoundly that it would be next to impossible to defeat. He also said each new
[02:36:13] incarnation of the group brought a school of thought even more rigid than its predecessor.
[02:36:20] A central tenant of ISIS brainwashing of new followers was its singular focus on the United
[02:36:26] States. Homsa said in what he described as an obsession with America. It was the big enemy.
[02:36:45] Got to have somebody to fight against. I've got to have a bad guy.
[02:36:48] Where the good guys you got to have a bad guy? America makes a very nice bad guy for a much
[02:36:57] of the world. There's always going to be a different cause. That's what I always found to
[02:37:04] is that I'll use the example of Gantonamo Bay. You could close that down but they're going
[02:37:13] to find another cause. There's always going to be a reason. I think we close one thing down.
[02:37:27] Create a Palestinian state. Whatever the reason is there's always going to be another one.
[02:37:30] That's something that I think people don't really want to recognize. When it comes to policies
[02:37:36] that you can't have these arbitrary lines between war and peace necessarily. Those days are long
[02:37:42] on. With terrorist groups like this, it's just something that I think we have to learn to manage
[02:37:50] to some degree and I hate saying that because I want to be able to say that it can be totally
[02:37:55] defeated but I don't think that's realistic. I think maybe I hope.
[02:38:09] Maybe I just hope but I always hope that human beings intrinsic motivation for freedom
[02:38:30] will rise eventually to a very positive place in the world.
[02:38:36] I hope so too. I really do. I'm not even sure I believe my own hope. That's what my hope is.
[02:38:48] I said I hope. And what's unfortunate is you see various places in the world where freedom
[02:38:57] rises and that my theory would be that once it rises it's going to move forward.
[02:39:03] Unfortunately we see it received. I ran to great example. The freedom in Iran in the 60s and 70s
[02:39:13] was completely on the rise and it absolutely receded.
[02:39:17] Totally. Maybe my hope is misplaced.
[02:39:21] I think in Syria and in the beginning with the revolution in the Arab Spring, there were freedom
[02:39:27] and there was a legitimate movement of wanting a better life that wasn't under the Bashar al-Assad
[02:39:35] dictatorship. But what happened was it got hijacked by a lot of these terrorist groups and
[02:39:40] Jahada, so then I guess diluted that opposition and then it became this very again. It wasn't
[02:39:45] black and white. It was an incredibly complicated mixture of opposition with a lot of them being
[02:39:53] good solid wanting to live a better life and then a lot of them being these awful terrorists.
[02:40:01] That in self was something I think was really hijacked and diluted.
[02:40:06] Yeah that story and you do a very good job in this of kind of showing some of those strange alliances.
[02:40:13] Very strange alliances that took place and what do you make of those strange alliances?
[02:40:19] Who are you aligned with and wait a second? What happens when we're done with this job and
[02:40:24] all of a sudden I look my person that just helped me and realized that they've got a whole
[02:40:28] other idea where they're heading?
[02:40:33] I mean around work to defeat ISIS too. And look at how the US policy is with Iran. I mean
[02:40:40] the friend of the friend is not your is your enemy or not.
[02:40:44] Yeah exactly that's what thing is that old saying is that saying just goes around in circles.
[02:40:53] You know I'm gonna I'm gonna fast forward past some of these wars. I'm gonna I'm gonna pass the
[02:41:00] past the battle. You know you detail some of the stuff of the musul and you definitely talk about
[02:41:06] rock and insuria and I'm gonna fast forward and again I'm just gonna I have to otherwise I just
[02:41:15] hit here and read this entire book and I don't want to have you here forever but we get to a point
[02:41:23] where the cleanup is now happening and this is at the end of the book and the cleanup is happening
[02:41:29] in the musule and in this particular case there's cleanup happening in in Tallah Far.
[02:41:38] And I'll just go to the book 40 miles west of musule Tallah Far had a population of about
[02:41:45] a hundred thousand before being captured by ISIS in June of 2014. The city was liberated in
[02:41:50] October of 2017 remnants of war were everywhere. bodies found around and under homes I learned
[02:41:56] were not uncommon neither was the smell of future-fied flesh. In many cases families living under ISIS
[02:42:05] rule were forced to bury bodies in their own homes and backyards as well as in local public squares.
[02:42:12] Sometimes victims were made to dig their own shallow graves. The 43 person emergency division
[02:42:21] was tasked only with removing civilian remains from mass graves. The larger 700 person
[02:42:28] nivina civil defense corps was in charge of sweeping up bodies from the streets and collecting
[02:42:34] them from individuals from individual from within individual homes.
[02:42:39] The first wasted life to be reached up from the sewage was that of an Iraqi soldier.
[02:42:53] His bones a blood-drenched uniform and a pair of handcuffs were exhumed.
[02:42:58] Then came seven more all dragged from beneath a home that had once served as a local headquarters
[02:43:07] of ISIS. Local officials who had been tipped off to the presence of the remains just a couple
[02:43:14] days earlier said the victims were likely held in the basement. Across the street at a second location
[02:43:22] another 12 decomposed civilian bodies were exhumed. Among the remains found were those of at least two
[02:43:31] children and dismembered heads without bodies. Each skeleton bore a thick black-blind fold.
[02:43:42] Most of the victims appeared to have been slain execution styles bullet-showered into the backs of their
[02:43:49] heads. It was a massacre. More and more of the same one police official told me.
[02:44:00] A police official always accompanied the recovery workers through their days work, a standard
[02:44:06] practice. It's never ending. The official continued staring out into the yellow fog which lifted
[02:44:11] into the bright sunshine as the day passed on. Officials had become all too familiar with the
[02:44:18] discovery of ISIS victims. Our duty is to the innocent people under the rubble.
[02:44:30] Said, how mighty Al Hussein commander of the Civil Defense Corps, emergency convoy unit he explained
[02:44:37] to me over cold tea the night before ISIS kills them and throws them into the sewage one by one
[02:44:45] and covers it over with cement. This is their way. After several grueling hours with small children
[02:44:54] watching from low-lying rooftops above 20 body bags were sealed and handed over to Iraqi federal police.
[02:45:03] Law enforcement took them to a specialized committee for examining the bodies whenever possible,
[02:45:08] surviving family members of the victims were notified. For DaWad DaWood Salam Mood Ali, a 44-year-old
[02:45:22] rescue worker from the zoo, considered something of a hero among his peers for excavating the
[02:45:27] bodies for 27 years. It was a job that never got easier.
[02:45:31] Sometimes it's five or six entire families all buried in one house. He told me after losing
[02:45:40] after hoating himself off behind the fire truck at the end of a shift in Tallahafar.
[02:45:45] As a father, especially when I see women and children, it hurts.
[02:45:52] I've had to pull out many pregnant women too.
[02:45:54] DaWood said he and his team had recovered 2,400 bodies since Missouil was liberated last July.
[02:46:05] With more than 2,000 of those coming from the old city on the west side in Tallahafar,
[02:46:10] they had recovered 640 bodies, many of whom were still unidentified.
[02:46:14] Another 500 bodies were discovered last year in a mass grave between the two strongholds.
[02:46:25] There wasn't just human recovery required of the dedicated team. Ali was also burned with
[02:46:31] demining bodies, sometimes those of ISIS fighters. I can tell straight away if they are ISIS.
[02:46:38] They are usually booby trapped and often have foreign passport strapped to them.
[02:46:42] We don't remove them. Our command after demining them is to leave them and authorities take those.
[02:46:55] I stood alone as the last of the lives were swathed in those big black bags.
[02:47:01] Their brains bursting through empty eye sockets.
[02:47:04] I tore off my surgical mask, heaving at the smell of rotting corpses in the unbearable heat.
[02:47:19] Iraq stood still at the fork between a potential future of death and one that would value life.
[02:47:27] It was a place that resembled a fractured mosaic that could only be put back together
[02:47:35] by young generation who knew little of life not maimed by the brutality.
[02:47:44] It was supposed to be a time after the war. It was supposed to be a time of peace.
[02:47:50] Only all it felt like was strange and sorrowful.
[02:48:00] I thought about that tried and true expression. We all tend to offer one another during hardships.
[02:48:08] Everything happens for a reason.
[02:48:09] No. There was no reason these young men and women had to die alone. Their bodies left to decay
[02:48:25] in the literal bowels of their country. There was no great lesson to come from that.
[02:48:32] No sense in that they had completed their mission on earth and no reason that it was there time to be taken by God.
[02:48:46] That is the lie we tell ourselves.
[02:48:54] A child from the neighborhood who had watched without flinching as the bodies were brought up
[02:49:00] peered over what was left of the bond-out fence.
[02:49:09] He looked through the gaping hole into my tearful eyes.
[02:49:19] Soon we stopped crying for the dead he whispered.
[02:49:21] But all we can do is cry for the living.
[02:49:29] That too was war.
[02:49:45] That is not quite the closing of the book but obviously it's the name of the book.
[02:50:05] Like I said we probably covered five red, plus than five percent of the book today.
[02:50:10] And these stories, every page, every story, just captures so much of this perspective that you are
[02:50:23] trying to convey.
[02:50:25] For me coming home from my experiences, for instance my first deployment to Iraq, we spent a
[02:50:47] lot of time at home. At that time the enemy would attack from bridges.
[02:50:56] When you drive underneath a bridge you would get a little stand by mode, get that little heightened awareness.
[02:51:09] So when I got back to America you are driving and around Baghdad and much of Iraq they look
[02:51:15] like highways in California. This is a big highway with signs.
[02:51:21] There was when I first got back you would start to feel or a vehicle would get close because you
[02:51:27] don't want vehicles close to your home, the convoy. You would see a vehicle coming close in for
[02:51:31] that split second. Why does this guy get close to me? But the approaching that bridge and get that
[02:51:36] little sensation of brace for it. So you have these memories I guess that stick with you.
[02:51:46] And I've got a bunch of those different memories that stick with me.
[02:51:53] What where are you at? What memories stick with you? Do you have trouble getting back to normal?
[02:52:01] Do you have trouble with going to sleep at night? I think this was a project I worked on a few
[02:52:11] years ago and I think there has been a little bit of distance from it for me. I remember being in
[02:52:18] the middle of it and when I was still riding and covering it it was an obsession to try to
[02:52:26] understand it to get the story right, to get the facts right and it was so all encompassing.
[02:52:33] And coming back it it always took me a couple of weeks to kind of readjust but one of the biggest
[02:52:38] sort of long-lasting impacts I was found in my experience was I think it was a sense of that
[02:52:47] feeling a little bit unsafe but I would be in New York or LA. I was in living in both cities at the time.
[02:52:53] And you get a fishing scam or something on your phone that everybody gets. And for me it was
[02:53:00] oh my god I'm being targeted who wants something from me and I always I couldn't separate
[02:53:07] and think of it as well everybody gets these. For me it just became this sort of I was convinced
[02:53:12] everybody was tapping into my phone or and for me it was more of the I couldn't see this sort of
[02:53:18] enemy and that took me a while to kind of let go of that a little bit and to be like
[02:53:25] you know you're okay nobody's coming at you now nobody's trying to hack into your emails
[02:53:30] nobody's trying to figure out who you're talking to on this particular day or maybe they were but
[02:53:35] you know it definitely was something I'd exaggerated I think in my head. So that's something I've
[02:53:41] had to have separation from and I think that I've done that but I still I think about it a lot
[02:53:49] I think about you know a lot of the people that I meant and think you know I try to find out
[02:53:56] where they are what they're doing I think today with all these you know what's app signal
[02:54:00] encrypted messaging you stay in contact with these people a lot and that's something that
[02:54:06] a previous journalist and different generations didn't have so today which is lovely you can
[02:54:12] still sort of stay in contact with them and their families and then but it also is that
[02:54:19] you do sort of feel helpless because there's not much you can do and I dedicate this book to
[02:54:25] it was a family that I stayed within in Syria and they live in a place called Cubani and it was
[02:54:30] sort of one of the big I sister-ung holds in the beginning and they you know they took me in and
[02:54:36] you create these immediate bonds with people because you know they were my immediate sort of family
[02:54:42] and they had two young sons and uh mezzles wife, Parashan was pregnant at the time and they said
[02:54:47] oh when I left and we gone through all these you know experiences and and when I left they said oh well
[02:54:53] if she's a if we have a daughter we're gonna name a holly and I just sort of smiled and I thought
[02:54:59] that was really endearing and lovely sure enough a few months later I get a message and a picture
[02:55:03] that she had a girl and they named a holly's fault the same as me and I was funny and I tried
[02:55:08] to sort of check in I can't even send them a copy of the book I can't send them you know anything
[02:55:14] but I tried to check in you know with them and it was really sweet because they said
[02:55:19] oh there's about five holly's in Cubani now so it's kind of this funny little trend and I was just so
[02:55:26] I was so undid by it and I think it's those moments in life where you create bonds with people
[02:55:34] and they want nothing from you they're not trying to get anything from you they're not trying to
[02:55:40] have their name and a newspaper they're not trying to to do any of that they just want to protect you
[02:55:46] and it's such a rare thing in this day and age to have those relationships that you know
[02:55:54] aren't transactional in some way other than it just comes from a place that is so pure and I think
[02:55:59] that's also why I was so attracted to the work because you're really meeting people in their
[02:56:04] most authentic state and I think that's just a huge thing I've tried to do in my in my life at home
[02:56:11] too is it's to really weed out you know what what doesn't serve me as a human being and and
[02:56:18] look for those authentic relationships and that's one of the biggest takeaways for me in working
[02:56:23] in those hormones. I remember when when I got back from my last deployment and then I retired
[02:56:34] and I you know we talked to guys and see stories about guys that would that guys that were
[02:56:41] in Vietnam more and they go back to Vietnam and then when I started doing the podcast we met guys
[02:56:46] that had gone back to Vietnam and I read more stories about guys that had gone back to Vietnam
[02:56:50] and then you know you can take it to the the guys that weren't World War II that would go back
[02:56:55] to the beaches of Normandy and and I remember thinking to myself as far as going back to Iraq
[02:57:03] especially when I first got home this is I don't want to go back there don't want to go back
[02:57:09] there no I'm never going back there only recently have I started to feel think to myself you know
[02:57:15] it would be kind of cold of a back and walk those streets again do where where are you at?
[02:57:24] Oh I was I was planning to go back just before I covered lockdown I read a reason ago and then I
[02:57:30] was approached to even go I think like in a couple of weeks to go and I had to sort of turn it down
[02:57:35] because for different reasons but oh yeah in a heartbeat I feel like Iraq is sort of just
[02:57:41] a yeah it's kind of a second home really you know it's been a little bit since I've been there but
[02:57:48] I have nothing but sort of a desire to still go there I don't I don't view it as a place that I
[02:57:56] never want to go again yeah I'm slowly getting through that maybe because I don't have
[02:58:04] a lot of things I don't really like my memories of it a lot of them are great memories that's
[02:58:10] what makes me start you know I used to say to the platoon guys like you're going through things while
[02:58:14] you're on deployment and you're mad about this and you're mad at that guy and you're mad at this other
[02:58:19] guy and I said you know what two weeks after we get home we're gonna forget all those bad stuff
[02:58:22] just remember the good stuff and sure enough as time goes by you just remember the good stuff so I think
[02:58:27] I'm getting there with specifically with the city of Ramadi and it was really I mean obviously it was
[02:58:32] heart-wrenching to see that when Ramadi got taken over by ISIS and the the the block flag of ISIS
[02:58:42] flying over the government center which I know so many people had fought so hard to liberate that city
[02:58:48] and it was doing so well and then it got smashed by ISIS I remember there's pictures of
[02:58:55] after after the Iraqi soldiers went back in they annihilated Ramadi they blew up so many buildings there was
[02:59:04] a neighborhood called Tamim on in Western Western Ramadi and they I saw pictures of it it was just
[02:59:11] leveled building after building after building because they just every building that they thought might
[02:59:15] have a mind they blew it up and guess what they thought about they all had IDs so they blew them all up
[02:59:20] but yeah I think you have a much better relationship with the land and the people and the memories
[02:59:29] than I do right yeah and for me it really is it comes down to the people it does it's it's the people who
[02:59:38] who I mean what a privilege it is to to for these people to just to trust you enough with some of
[02:59:46] these stories to be that vulnerable with somebody that they don't know you know at least initially
[02:59:52] and I think that's that's something I take as an honor really to be able to to be some kind of
[02:59:59] vessel in in telling that for me you know I hate to use the word voice when people say it's a voice
[03:00:05] of a voice let's say no they have a voice but but I think as a journalist you you're awesome kind of
[03:00:10] vessel that can can bring that back and and tell that and I can't do anything really beyond that
[03:00:18] I think that was also something I had to learn was that you want to be able to think that a story is
[03:00:23] going to make a difference it's going to change the answer you know some law makers mind somewhere
[03:00:28] and something's going to happen and you know 99.9% of the time it doesn't change anything but
[03:00:33] doesn't make it any you know less important to do and be once you take that weight off your shoulders
[03:00:40] it's so much easier to do your job because again it's that clear mandate you know what it is
[03:00:45] that you're doing and everything else after that is out of your hands and not in the description
[03:00:53] well that's a probably a great place to wrap this up because what you've absolutely done in this book is
[03:00:58] you have told their stories and we will pass these stories on to as many people as we can
[03:01:07] and I think like Haley love said you know you've got what your talent is right you've got your
[03:01:13] skill in life and Haley love can make videos and sing and and you've got this ability to write and share
[03:01:20] these stories and that's what you've done so echo you got anything I know Haley that we can find you
[03:01:35] well the book will be up on the website if you want to order the book on Twitter and on Instagram
[03:01:44] you are Haley I he is I don't weird spelling for him I he I guess it's it's slightly unusual okay my mum was having a moment
[03:01:51] Haley S McCann McCay McCay on and on Facebook there's no S just Haley McCay and you also have
[03:01:59] Haley McCay dot com yes so put it up there yep so people can go there and check out what you're up to
[03:02:05] which is next project be in the next so I'm working on a few different things so I have a couple of
[03:02:09] writing projects that I am nodding out the the basis on it's it's going to be quite a journey and I'm
[03:02:17] waiting for trouble to open up but I'm sort of looking a little bit more into the survival aspect of it
[03:02:23] so yeah so that'll be interesting and I am yeah just kind of focused on that for now and sort of
[03:02:31] doing a lot more sort of geopolitical stuff as well so it's kind of branching out.
[03:02:36] Do you write do you are you writing news anymore on a regular basis? I'm doing a little bit here and there
[03:02:42] but I'm really focused on my more long-term projects right now kind of getting down a little bit
[03:02:47] more to the new degree and the things that I I really see is important as opposed to the daily
[03:02:53] turn so I'm sort of taking a bit of a leap in that so it's nice. How is the book writing process
[03:02:59] did you like it? I you always have a love hate with you know but most of the time I really love
[03:03:06] it and I I love being able to to I hate being having to decipher my handwriting out of a notebook
[03:03:14] but beyond that I really love being able to kind of just sit and you sort of meditate on the
[03:03:20] details and and I try to remember colors and faces and places and and all those things and try to
[03:03:26] to put it into words and so it can be challenging definitely and it can be definitely moments that I
[03:03:31] just I don't want you to go into it. Did you take pictures? I did I took a lot of pictures. So we need to
[03:03:37] get those up on the web so yeah I'll get you pictures of whatever you need so a lot of these these people
[03:03:42] they have they have a basis and places and yeah the you wrote a novel. I did when I was young
[03:03:52] and what's up with the novel where it's a little I didn't I'm sure it's somewhere in Australia
[03:03:56] probably in my dad's garage. It was a it was a sort of a young teen fiction novel yeah we
[03:04:02] know he's going to that. I loved to write I was writing you know that's one thing aside from from my
[03:04:10] ballet from a young age I love to tell those stories in a way that I love to write and make up
[03:04:15] weed and wonderful things and yeah awesome awesome um anything else do you got anything else here?

[03:05:04] Australia. Well it's all come together for I mean I think it's very clear that this is a powerful
[03:05:11] book and I thank you for coming on here I thank you for letting jockel publishing put it out
[03:05:20] along with uh along with the angelo publishing our friends Sequoia so that's awesome and it's it's
[03:05:27] an honor for me to be able to help get this book out there to the world and get these stories shared.
[03:05:32] Thank you I appreciate it and I look I I hope I didn't come off as um crazy or arrogant or like
[03:05:44] a jerk when I was talking about the fact that we we do some crazy stuff when we're young and there's
[03:05:50] a certain amount of being naive but I don't care how naive you are or how naive you were
[03:05:58] for you to go into these places to capture these stories and I didn't there's there's plenty of
[03:06:04] stories in there where I know from being in combat myself how close you were to the front lines
[03:06:11] how close you how much danger you were in all the time so thank you for writing the book but also
[03:06:16] thank you for your courage and your bravery to go out there take these risks to capture these
[03:06:22] stories to capture the horrors of war so that hopefully we as a race of people in the world
[03:06:32] can learn to avoid it at all costs absolutely thank you Holly thank you thank you both
[03:06:42] and with that Holly has left the building and left us with an incredible book with some
[03:06:51] incredible accounts in it so definitely check out that book a lot of horror in that book
[03:07:02] a lot of horror in the world yeah yeah it's bad how like like she'll describe each detail and
[03:07:09] it goes along with kind of what we've been saying a lot where it's like yeah when you just individualized
[03:07:13] one thing and see their story it's like oh man it really opens up this perspective of like man
[03:07:18] this is bad yeah and by the way this is 430 something page book you know and I probably
[03:07:26] read 20 pages something like that so it's an awesome book and yeah check it out a lot of horror
[03:07:36] a lot of horror in the book a lot of horror in the world I kind of feel like we should do our best
[03:07:43] to bring some good in the world starting with our own lives trying to live a good life
[03:07:54] start there yeah kind of be appreciative to you know oh yeah I didn't bring it up Holly
[03:08:02] just you know um living on the floor of some random blown out building she's getting after it man
[03:08:09] she's getting after she doesn't she she talks about it but it's not that's what it's very
[03:08:16] humbly written story because it's not about her yeah yeah it's not about her it's about the people
[03:08:23] and so with that it's yeah yeah very cool yeah that says kind of a lot too but in author says
[03:08:31] they don't make it about themselves because she could she could oh this could 100% this could be a
[03:08:37] book about her yeah 100% I went here and I did this I did that it's not that that's not what the
[03:08:44] book is I thought my life in thought to be over it in fact I had to drag it out of her I had to drag
[03:08:51] out of her where she came from and how it started and how she got there she just jumped right into it
[03:08:55] and what you just said about I was here and I was there she'll be talking about it and I can tell
[03:09:02] what she means but a lot of people it's gonna you she said you know their explosion happened here
[03:09:08] you know what I'm thinking okay I know what's happening there there's gunfire going on
[03:09:12] that's not she just kind of puts it under the right under the radar kind of her ammo is to be
[03:09:18] under the radar so yeah so yeah yeah we do have to be appreciative for sure we're like even at like
[03:09:28] even if you're not involved in the war in these places even like a similar feather you are
[03:09:37] being appreciative of that yeah because like your day-to-day life here versus day-to-day life there
[03:09:43] even best case scenarios brought to different your worst kid your worst day here is better than your
[03:09:49] best day there for 99% of the population if not more oh yeah so yeah it's man make the best of it's
[03:09:56] one of those deals right anyway all right so yes let's not let our lives and capabilities go to
[03:10:03] waste in any way let's try not to how about that I can't you know intention is a big deal
[03:10:09] it is just knowing these things that's a that's a huge start you know like G. I. Joe
[03:10:13] and I'm going to G. I. Joe what they'd say knowing he's half the battle
[03:10:18] did G. I. Joe actually say that I thought that was Sun Sue and 25,000, 2500 years ago
[03:10:23] no yeah Joe that's probably what's on. This clear yeah sir so yeah so you gotta keep these things in
[03:10:31] mind did you work out today if you're like oh wait did I work out you gotta know these can't
[03:10:36] stuff and you gotta know whether or not you're working out tomorrow so you're saying working out is
[03:10:40] important definitely and yes I did work out today yes so you work out every day right
[03:10:45] I do like that's that's the that's the jam. Yeah I'd done recently incorporated that into my whole thing
[03:10:52] usually I'd have a five day and then to rest day situation who rest days back to back yes sir
[03:10:58] like usually the weekend because of my program goes five days at a time like week by week and that's
[03:11:02] just how it is convenient and it is convenient but it had that was it even before even before I was
[03:11:08] going to need a rest day's or nothing like that or had less one had less going on what I'm saying
[03:11:12] so that was the the structured program but I found that if you sort of spread it out little bit more
[03:11:18] and I try to go hard to on every single day like hard at least one thing hard you know some
[03:11:23] people that like oh yeah seven days but like this one or two days like it's like a mobility day
[03:11:28] well I might have depending on how I feel I can I can tell when I've beat myself down to where I need
[03:11:34] a co-op mobility day for sure oh you just try and break a sweat yeah like just at a minimum just you
[03:11:40] know at a minimum I'm gonna break a sweat yeah seeing that and you know there's there's a
[03:11:45] bunch of different effective philosophies in working out and working out programs so like again I'm
[03:11:50] not saying oh yours I know the few as good as mine I'm not saying that at all but I found and currently
[03:11:56] what I'm currently on is the to do something hard like hard where your body has to be like hey we
[03:12:03] got to recover from this whether be like a one small body part situation even like a met
[03:12:08] concentration like that just at least one thing I like that on these kind of one-off days you
[03:12:13] a normal workout day as hard it's it's gonna be a hard one oh you're saying on that easier
[03:12:18] day you're still gonna do one thing hard hard yeah I like it I actually do a very similar version
[03:12:23] of that not consciously but unconsciously yeah so let's say I'm going a little bit let's say I'm
[03:12:28] not going super hard metcon style but I'm gonna probably go heavy or if I'm going heavy or if I'm
[03:12:34] getting not really like feeling the metcon I'll have you somewhere yeah so I guess we're kind of in the
[03:12:39] same boat yeah it keeps your body there trying to you know to it trying to adapt adapt and get you know
[03:12:44] kind of rebuild itself as the new and improved version you know and so hopefully we can kind of
[03:12:51] take this philosophy and apply it to the our whole life hopefully same but here's a thing keep in mind
[03:12:57] we might need some supplementation from time to time you don't get you don't get
[03:13:01] nine hours asleep every single night you know you don't you don't max max molly nine hours
[03:13:10] because it's something everybody's different so you don't you don't recover max you don't
[03:13:16] maximize your recovery every single day okay once well you need some supplementation
[03:13:20] for sure you need some supplementation in fact you got a little supplementation routine boom
[03:13:25] you're gonna be on the track even quicker faster more effectively the worries jockel has some
[03:13:31] supplementation jockel feel so here it is you need protein supplementation got milk
[03:13:36] tastes like a dessert by the way I've been on that train for about a almost a month now
[03:13:43] I forgot I forgot the joy the glory so actually going rewind just a little bit so all this stuff
[03:13:50] you can be on a subscription yeah we mentioned it before but the subscription you will
[03:13:55] not have to pay shipping right you will not have to remember to take these less fun ones to
[03:14:02] take and I'll mean less fun like they're like anti fun I'm just saying the difference between
[03:14:06] taking a milkshake drinking a milkshake and taking joint warfare or super cruel oil like one
[03:14:13] has like a pleasurable experience one is kind of like okay you just sort of do it one's prolonged
[03:14:18] pleasure when you don't have joint pain yeah but that's the delayed that's the delayed
[03:14:23] great I'm just saying if you forget like it's a little bit more can be more of a thing anyway
[03:14:30] check you got a subscription you don't have to even think about that kind of stuff
[03:14:34] also do you get like a discount or something you get a discount or a little 10% discount
[03:14:39] oh so please subscribe yeah yeah and free shipping so then you combine those two things together
[03:14:44] we're in a good spot oh yeah so it's kind of a no brain wind yeah it's a no brainer if you're like
[03:14:49] if you're taking it consistently which you should be trust me the difference between even that
[03:14:54] taking it not taking it consistently night in day man so if you're doing it it's a win-win win really
[03:14:59] triple win triple win come on so joccafuel.com you can get your supplementation there which you
[03:15:05] apparently do need you do need and if you subscribe to it you get shipping free any good

[03:15:42] product itself is all american made. do you can you and i don't expect you answer this question but
[03:15:50] i wonder if you can find something that's not american made in the whole chain like if you go to
[03:15:55] one of the looms that they got could you find like a set of screws that are used in there you
[03:15:59] like hey those are made in you know somewhere you are going to be hard pressed to find something
[03:16:03] in your jeans that is not 100% American maybe yeah crazy. In fact the jeans i can tell you there's
[03:16:11] nothing that's not american made. The clothing 100% american. I mean and not always at 100% american
[03:16:17] made we know where it came from. We know where the the hide is that we're getting the leather from.
[03:16:24] We know where that is. Yeah. It goes deep. So yeah american made bunch of awesome stuff
[03:16:31] by a bunch of awesome people in farming can made. Yeah sorry orgeneus a.com sorry i said orgenein
[03:16:38] I'm sure you can still go to order to me. You can't put it. Let's face it. Orgeneus a.com's
[03:16:43] little bit stronger. We'll say it's stronger yes. Not the mains not strong but look
[03:16:48] with who'd rather fight a war against main or a marathon. You know what I'm saying? I believe in
[03:16:53] mains but yeah you're switching goods made. Right so i think we'll go with it. Well we'll go with
[03:16:56] origin USA. Yes you're home. I agree. So yes also jocke was a store as well jocke store.
[03:17:02] .com this is where you can get your discipline equals freedom shirts and hats and hoodies. Good
[03:17:10] all kinds of cool stuff on there. You get the shirt i'm wearing right now. Yeah. You can get the jacket
[03:17:14] that you're wearing exactly the jacket. Lightweight hoodie. You can get a lightweight hoodie that
[03:17:18] echo Charles is wearing right now. It's lightweight hoodie weather. You're over taking on and off
[03:17:25] your hoodie which I did. I'll do it just off. It's just off. Apparently it is. Because i'm
[03:17:29] more of enough you showed up with it on. I showed up with mine on. Fine. Came in here.
[03:17:37] Fine. You see I'm saying no. So all I'm going to tell you is that in the middle of the
[03:17:41] bell curve you're good. If we go outside the bell curve and either direction you're out of
[03:17:46] your luck. So if you get a little colder you're screwed and if it gets more hot you're screwed.
[03:17:52] Yeah that's true. So guess it looks like I'm right. I like the aesthetic value that this lightweight
[03:17:58] is. So you like some of us like this kind of stuff. Some of us are just over trying to win.

[03:18:35] suggestion for the true book. I got your name the shirt locker because the name which I will not
[03:18:41] mention because I don't want to hear it that echo Charles's lack of creativity. Yes. Okay.

[03:19:31] is in the house. We should be rolling out with some of those grounded podcasts. Again,
[03:19:36] working it, working it and the work your kid podcast, working it. I have some time coming up so we
[03:19:44] should get some of those done. You can also join us at the Jockel Underground.com. Jockel Underground.com.
[03:19:53] We have alternative podcasts with some amplifying information, some other subject matters,
[03:19:59] some behind the scenes. We got some Q&A that were working on where you can send in your audio,
[03:20:04] voice, video, thing and we'll put all that together. Also the underground, what I kind of notice
[03:20:10] when I listen to them and stuff. These are like, I mean, I think it all, even the Jockel podcast.
[03:20:15] Of course, like makes your brain like think and work and stuff. But it's like, I find myself like
[03:20:20] doing little brain. It's like exercise for your brain almost, you know. You start to think about
[03:20:26] stuff like, oh wait, do I do that? Oh wait, does that apply to me? Yeah, I would tell you that the
[03:20:31] subject matter in the Jockel Underground podcast are based on me going through daily life and
[03:20:39] recognizing the patterns and the maneuvers and the thoughts and the curiosity and, wait, why do
[03:20:48] it, why did that happen? Why do we do that? And sometimes it doesn't fit into a Jockel podcast
[03:20:52] because it's something about psychology or something about negotiate, whatever. Yeah.
[03:20:57] Yeah. And so, but it's very important. And does it, it's like a venn diagram. Is there
[03:21:03] some part of it that's leadership? Yes, there's some hundred that's the history. Yes, there's
[03:21:07] some psychology. Some sociology out. It's all mixed in there. But what it's what it is, it's all
[03:21:12] subject matter that will help you help to meet. It helps me. But it's me digging into and revealing
[03:21:19] why these things are happening. Why am I doing these things? Sometimes my instincts are good.
[03:21:23] Sometimes they're not good. But either way, I'm going to learn from it. And it's just the approach
[03:21:28] that I take in life to try and figure something out because like to Jitsu, you know when you
[03:21:32] change a Jitsu and someone goes, oh, put your arm here and you're like, okay, but then the next
[03:21:37] day you don't really remember that. But if someone says, put your, put your arm here and here's
[03:21:40] why you do it and you start to understand the concept. So I think that's a big part of the
[03:21:47] Jockel underground podcast is what's the concept behind what's happening here? What makes it,
[03:21:53] it like Jitsu obviously, a great analogy where like there's certain things in Jitsu and such a
[03:21:58] quintely in life or your day to day, whatever that certain things are not intuitive. In fact,
[03:22:06] they're counter-counted into like, you know, in Jitsu to turn your back, right? And like a
[03:22:10] full, like there's so many reasons in regular life to like turn your back. That's the best
[03:22:16] move it feels like it for moment to moment. Like if someone's mounted on you like turning your back,
[03:22:20] if you never trained you Jitsu, it's weird. Basically, I want to get away. How do you get away,
[03:22:24] turn your back and run away? Or you can't run into more than that ground. Yeah, like if you're
[03:22:28] mounting, you try to stand up the most powerful way you can stand up is to turn over and stand
[03:22:33] up with him on your back. You can't do a sit up with someone correct? You know, so it's like
[03:22:37] there's all these intuitive things that are incorrect. That is going to make you lose.
[03:22:41] And then it's the same thing with the like a lot of the weather, the cognitive biases or whatever.
[03:22:46] It's kind of the same thing. Yeah, it's real interesting. You kind of explore them and you're like,
[03:22:50] oh man, shoot out. And then you know what to do and what not to do. So that's the joccal wonderground.com.
[03:22:56] If you want to come and check that out, look, it's also us our way of having a contingency plan.
[03:23:03] In case things get wild, in case there's a bunch of things that could happen. Look,
[03:23:08] we could get a censored for something that some subject matter that we cover. We could get
[03:23:16] people could start to say, okay, well, now you're going to put our inject advertisements into your
[03:23:21] podcast. We don't want that. We just want to have a long advertising hit the end that echo talks
[03:23:27] for 48 minutes on. But we don't want that. So that's what we're doing. We don't want to be held

[03:27:24] the world who stand and face evil like ISIS every day. Thank you for keeping that evil at bay.
[03:27:31] And right here at home, all the police and law enforcement fire fighters and paramedics and EMTs
[03:27:37] and dispatchers and correction officers and board patrol and secret service and all first responders.
[03:27:41] Thank you for keeping us safe on the home front and everyone else out there.
[03:27:48] You heard it today. There is a lot of evil in the world. It's everywhere.
[03:27:55] And it's up to all of us to fight against it. That doesn't mean you have to pick up a gun.
[03:28:02] Doesn't mean you have to pick up a weapon. Doesn't mean you have to go overseas. But you have to fight it.
[03:28:10] And we have to make sure we keep it up bay by making sure we never forget that it's there.
[03:28:16] And then what we need to do is go out every day and do good and bring light into the world.
[03:28:28] And until next time, the Zekko and Jako out.
