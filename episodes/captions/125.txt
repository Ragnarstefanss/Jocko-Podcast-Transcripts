00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.38 This is Jockel podcast number 125 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening,
00:00:07.38 --> 00:00:15.62 I go. Good evening and we are bringing a Q&A today. Sure. To the world. First question.
00:00:15.62 --> 00:00:22.84 Dang right into it. Okay. All right. What is the difference between an excuse and a reason?
00:00:22.84 --> 00:00:33.28 Hmm. Kind of a good question, right? Sure. Okay. And the reason it's a good question
00:00:33.28 --> 00:00:41.68 because there can be legitimate reasons why things happen. Right? And so, for instance,
00:00:41.68 --> 00:00:49.20 you're in a sailing race, right? In a sailboat. And the mast snaps in half. Now you don't
00:00:49.20 --> 00:00:56.20 win the race. But I mean, you didn't, you know, the mast snapped. What can you do about that?
00:00:56.20 --> 00:01:00.64 Or the weather is horrible. Weather rolls in. You can't launch your aircraft so you can't
00:01:00.64 --> 00:01:05.60 go on your mission. You can't control the weather. So, you know, like, what's up? How
00:01:05.60 --> 00:01:10.84 can that? That's a reason. Or you get really sick. So, you can't compete in a competition.
00:01:10.84 --> 00:01:16.40 That's a reason. You know, you were sick. Oh, you do bad because you were sick in it. It's a
00:01:16.40 --> 00:01:23.44 reason. Could be called now. Now, you could look at the situation and say, okay, if I'm
00:01:23.44 --> 00:01:31.56 going to take ownership of this, did I properly test the mast? Did I? Let me ask you this.
00:01:31.56 --> 00:01:36.84 Did we have a ground-based plan for the operation in case the weather came in? We were
00:01:36.84 --> 00:01:43.96 going to take vehicles instead. Right? Yeah. That would work. If you get sick before the
00:01:43.96 --> 00:01:49.36 competition, maybe you ask yourself, were you resting properly? Were you eating properly,
00:01:49.36 --> 00:01:55.96 going into the competition? So you wouldn't get sick. You could address that, correct?
00:01:55.96 --> 00:02:02.000 Yes. So, you can still take ownership of things, even if the initial reaction is like,
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.96 all of this, you can't control that. Well, that you can influence it. You can mitigate it.
00:02:06.96 --> 00:02:13.76 Right? Now, can there still be legitimate reasons? Yes, they're can. And for me,
00:02:13.76 --> 00:02:24.48 the difference, the line between an excuse and a reason is a reason you have zero control
00:02:24.48 --> 00:02:30.40 over. Right? You just have zero control over something happening? Well, that's a reason.
00:02:30.40 --> 00:02:37.000 Guy, tell you, I was almost late the other day. For something. No, because this is borderline.
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.92 This is borderline. I had an appointment at 10 o'clock. I left him. Is it 20 minutes
00:02:44.92 --> 00:02:54.16 drive? I left an hour. I left at, well, I left about 9. 10. I left 50 minutes to drive 20
00:02:54.16 --> 00:03:00.72 minutes. Just so I'm going to make it on time. Yeah. I get on the road basically a couple
00:03:00.72 --> 00:03:08.64 roads out of my house and the one entry way to get on the freeway is lockdown. Lockdown.
00:03:08.64 --> 00:03:12.000 Like incident, like isolated some incident.
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.88 Incident on a guy, a guy trying to kill himself on a bridge shot the road down. So no one's
00:03:17.88 --> 00:03:24.000 going on the highway. So what is it? Everyone's being channelized into marginal, what
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.08 are they called back side streets? Yeah. Yeah. Reto is rerolled. Yeah. The clock is ticking. And
00:03:32.08 --> 00:03:37.84 and I made it, right? I made it. I was four minutes. I had four minutes to spare. So instead
00:03:37.84 --> 00:03:44.56 of it taking 20 minutes, it took whatever. 46 minutes. It took more than twice as long.
00:03:44.56 --> 00:03:55.20 That could be a fairly legitimate reason. Now, luckily, I had, I always, you know, I had
00:03:55.20 --> 00:03:59.20 planned that there could be something out of my control. It might take even longer. And
00:03:59.20 --> 00:04:06.000 that's why I leave early to go to unemployment or situation like that. So I could have
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.68 also checked the traffic prior to leaving and taking a completely different route. That
00:04:12.68 --> 00:04:17.48 would have been, I blame myself. So even in that situation, I was thinking the whole time,
00:04:17.48 --> 00:04:24.20 why did I check the traffic before I left? I knew this could have happened. So anyways,
00:04:24.20 --> 00:04:29.56 in my opinion, an excuse is when you blame something that you could have controlled and
00:04:29.56 --> 00:04:35.48 a reason is something that you have absolutely no control over whatsoever. You think
00:04:35.48 --> 00:04:39.76 like a legit disease. I mean, sometimes people have, they just don't, you can't control
00:04:39.76 --> 00:04:45.20 that. It happens. But I think, and I think this is the important part. I think that what
00:04:45.20 --> 00:04:52.72 you will find, especially when you approach the world with an attitude of extreme ownership.
00:04:52.72 --> 00:04:54.96 And that's that you're not going to make any excuse. You're not going to blame it. And all
00:04:54.96 --> 00:05:00.48 it's, is that you actually have a lot more control over things than you think you do.
00:05:00.48 --> 00:05:10.16 So we've talked about this before. When I go to the airport, I get there really early,
00:05:10.16 --> 00:05:14.88 because it's something that you have no control over. You're going to stand in that TSA line,
00:05:14.88 --> 00:05:18.48 and those people are going to take forever. And that's the way it is. And if you want to get
00:05:18.48 --> 00:05:25.12 mad at them, you doesn't matter. You can't control. You cannot control it in any way. You can
00:05:25.12 --> 00:05:28.16 stand at the back of my flight, leaving in 30 minutes. And they'll be like, whatever,
00:05:28.16 --> 00:05:31.92 you should have shown up earlier. You can't control it. So in those situations, how do you control
00:05:31.92 --> 00:05:36.80 it? You show up early. You take ownership of it. You show up early. You don't just, I don't know what
00:05:36.80 --> 00:05:42.80 happened. The traffic was bad. I mean, it's just a million excuses. You can give. If you get that
00:05:42.80 --> 00:05:46.88 attitude where you're not going to make excuses, and you'll actually take ownership of the
00:05:46.88 --> 00:05:52.24 things. And then you'll actually solve problems before they even happen. If I'm going to an
00:05:52.24 --> 00:05:55.60 appointment, and I have the excuse in my back of my head that, you know what, if I'm late, I'll just
00:05:55.60 --> 00:06:04.08 say it was the traffic. I have much more increased chance of being late. All right. So what's,
00:06:04.08 --> 00:06:08.96 what that's, that's one of the things that makes extreme ownership hard is it hurt your ego.
00:06:10.24 --> 00:06:16.80 It hurts your ego. It hurts your ego to admit that you have control over things that went wrong. That's
00:06:16.80 --> 00:06:23.20 that they're, it's your fault that hurt your ego. It's also effective because of that. It's effective
00:06:23.20 --> 00:06:27.60 because you solve problems. Like I said before they even happen. You solve them because you take ownership of them.
00:06:27.60 --> 00:06:35.12 Yeah. But isn't this just a bunch of semantics, though, like excuses and reasons,
00:06:35.84 --> 00:06:42.80 because really when it comes down to it, excuses like in excuse, like you're excused. Like the
00:06:42.80 --> 00:06:47.76 reason is a reason for sure. But it's like, well, that's what this whole conversation. Yes, it is
00:06:47.76 --> 00:06:51.52 about semantics. And the semantics are for me, an excuse is something that you could have
00:06:51.52 --> 00:06:56.96 controlled and a reason is something that you could not control. Aren't they all reasons? So it's up to,
00:06:56.96 --> 00:07:03.60 I mean, again, you say tomato. I say to I get it. But come on, you brought it up. So,
00:07:04.56 --> 00:07:10.64 okay, so I remember when I went out and I went to school, you get, you come late to school.
00:07:11.04 --> 00:07:19.28 You get in trouble. Unless you have an excuse. Now, with it's, there's a difference between, and I'm
00:07:19.28 --> 00:07:24.48 saying in the, in the field, in class, right, you come, you come into class. If you have just your
00:07:24.48 --> 00:07:29.76 own excuse, like, oh, my, you know, dog ate it or I don't know, that's for homework. But whatever,
00:07:30.48 --> 00:07:37.52 that's different than if you have an excuse slip, which is an official slip, you know, your parents
00:07:37.52 --> 00:07:41.44 or whatever, you're also the office. Also, no, it's not your movement to get, excuse,
00:07:41.44 --> 00:07:45.84 slips change to reasons, slips. Right, right. Because that's what it's, it's a legitimate reason.
00:07:45.84 --> 00:07:50.08 Exactly. The kid had chicken pox can't come to school. You can't come. Yeah. You, there's nothing.
00:07:50.08 --> 00:07:55.52 You got chicken pox. That's what. That's what. That's how. Yeah. That's how. So, but now, given that,
00:07:55.52 --> 00:08:00.64 now, aren't we just talking about a very, like, a standard from case to case, so like, let's go back
00:08:00.64 --> 00:08:05.44 to school, but Brad bear with me. You want to get to the bottom of this. I'm telling you, if you,
00:08:05.44 --> 00:08:13.28 if you're barred by thread, if your parents had car trouble, right, is that an excuse for a
00:08:13.28 --> 00:08:19.92 nine year old? For a nine year old? Yeah. It is, it is a reason for a nine year old. So, that falls
00:08:19.92 --> 00:08:27.92 on the hierarchy of standards, but within the standards of being a quote unquote, legitimate
00:08:27.92 --> 00:08:33.12 excuse, right? Because that's really what it is. So, reason in your case, in your, yeah, a reason
00:08:33.12 --> 00:08:37.76 is language, language, language, language, and that's a reason as far as this question goes.
00:08:37.76 --> 00:08:42.64 Absolutely. In fact, I think I use the word legitimate in this, I was going to talk about it.
00:08:42.64 --> 00:08:47.60 Yeah. Yeah. And so, using the word reasons rather than excuse is just like, okay, let's make the
00:08:47.60 --> 00:08:53.76 language more simple rather than, because if you have an excuse, if you have an excuse, that's,
00:08:53.76 --> 00:08:58.88 it's that by its very nature by its very definition, you're excused. It's an excuse. You're excused
00:08:58.88 --> 00:09:05.04 from food for mean late or mean late to your, whatever, but if it's weird, because if someone
00:09:05.04 --> 00:09:09.76 else gives it to you, gives you the excuse. Like, you're excused. Hey, the guy was about to come
00:09:09.76 --> 00:09:15.20 at suicide, I get it, man. Your excuse kind of thing. It's like that's an excuse. In this case,
00:09:15.20 --> 00:09:20.72 a legitimate one. But if you give it to yourself, that's the excuse that nobody likes. All right?
00:09:21.60 --> 00:09:25.84 Like, hey, man, traffic all you should have prepared for that. Yeah.
00:09:25.84 --> 00:09:31.36 Hey, man, my, you know, whatever was going on in this and that, oh, man, you got to prepare for that.
00:09:31.36 --> 00:09:36.40 Do you seem saying? Yeah. I guess so. There you go. So reasons and
00:09:36.40 --> 00:09:41.76 legitimate excuses, same thing. Yeah, I'll give you that. You could have said that like four minutes.
00:09:41.76 --> 00:09:46.16 So there's no it. I'm just saying you'd have explained this thing because sometimes I
00:09:46.16 --> 00:09:51.52 hurt to understand. I'm telling you. No, see, the more you talked about it, the less I understand.
00:09:51.52 --> 00:09:56.88 I'm saying, said the last thing. I had to sum it up. Okay. The summary was great. I give you a
00:09:56.88 --> 00:10:01.92 big, a B plus on the summary. All right, thanks. I'll take it. Thank you. Yeah. Next question.
00:10:01.92 --> 00:10:11.12 Yes. Joko. Hindsight is 2020. But here's a crazy thought. North Korean soldiers would have
00:10:11.12 --> 00:10:17.04 ended up with a better life like South Korea. If they did not fight as they did in the 50s,
00:10:17.76 --> 00:10:24.000 when should a soldier question his leaders values? That is not a crazy question at all.
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.84 And the answer is very straightforward. A soldier should always question their leaders. Not just
00:10:29.84 --> 00:10:33.92 their leaders values, but their leaders plans. Their leaders strategies. Their leaders vision.
00:10:33.92 --> 00:10:38.56 You should question everything that your leader is telling you. And if you see something is wrong,
00:10:38.56 --> 00:10:44.64 then you should raise your hand and call it out. And I would say not only is it something that you
00:10:44.64 --> 00:10:51.20 should do? It's actually your duty. It's actually your duty is to raise your hand as a soldier.
00:10:51.20 --> 00:10:56.16 And I'll tell you this doesn't only apply to the military. It applies to any organization.
00:10:56.16 --> 00:11:06.32 And it might sound like I'm encouraging mute knee or rebellion. But actually the opposite is true.
00:11:06.32 --> 00:11:13.12 If you have a team that questions the leader, the leader doesn't become weaker. The leader becomes
00:11:13.12 --> 00:11:16.96 stronger. If he's a good leader, if he's on the right path, if he's doing the right thing, he becomes stronger.
00:11:16.96 --> 00:11:21.84 Because everyone starts to understand why things are happening. They understand the vision more fully.
00:11:21.84 --> 00:11:26.64 If the leader doesn't have a good vision and he's getting question and he can't answer the
00:11:26.64 --> 00:11:30.16 question, yeah, he might have a mute knee on his hands. But it's not because the people are
00:11:30.16 --> 00:11:38.24 asking questions because he doesn't know what he's doing. So the leader can't see everything.
00:11:38.24 --> 00:11:44.88 And he can't solve every problem or have every idea. But the collective mind of an organization
00:11:44.88 --> 00:11:49.52 can make that happen. And that's why as a leader, if I'm in a leader's position, I want my
00:11:49.52 --> 00:11:54.72 subordinates to question me. I want them to question me. And like I said, if I don't have a good answer,
00:11:54.72 --> 00:11:59.60 I then need to find one. And if I can't find one, then maybe I'm actually doing something wrong.
00:11:59.60 --> 00:12:07.20 That's entirely possible. And now from a, if we want to talk about like a moral or an ethical
00:12:07.20 --> 00:12:16.56 perspective, then absolutely. And there was a group of high ranking soldiers in Nazi Germany,
00:12:16.56 --> 00:12:21.20 that tried to kill Hitler. And unfortunately, they failed. But they did the right thing and tried
00:12:21.20 --> 00:12:24.48 in trying to kill him. They did the right thing. Like not only did they question them,
00:12:24.48 --> 00:12:26.64 they knew he was wrong. And they said, okay, we're going to kill him.
00:12:28.48 --> 00:12:33.76 Now, do you put yourself at risk when you ask these questions? Because I'm sitting here saying,
00:12:33.76 --> 00:12:37.36 yeah, I want my subordinates to ask questions. There's people that don't want their subordinates
00:12:37.36 --> 00:12:43.92 to ask questions. Not good leader, not good leadership. That's not a good way to lead. I'm sorry.
00:12:43.92 --> 00:12:49.92 I'm telling you the truth. I mean, and so there's a risk. Because if your leader doesn't
00:12:49.92 --> 00:12:52.72 want you to ask questions and you raise your hands and ask a question and you do it an
00:12:52.72 --> 00:12:57.04 untapped for a way and you do it a way that offense, your leader, well, then you might end up
00:12:57.04 --> 00:13:02.80 getting fired or if you try and kill Hitler, you might get killed yourself because that's what
00:13:02.80 --> 00:13:06.88 Hitler did. After his assassination, he's happy he went and killed a bunch of people, including
00:13:06.88 --> 00:13:12.32 Robball, his best general. Because he thought he was involved in it. So you, you're definitely
00:13:12.32 --> 00:13:18.48 taking a risk, but then you have to ask yourself what is the alternative. So in a moral or ethical
00:13:18.48 --> 00:13:22.24 situation, what's the alternative? And I'm not saying there's no alternative. Because sometimes
00:13:23.20 --> 00:13:28.16 maybe you'd be better not trying to kill Hitler, but rise in the ranks and get to a situation
00:13:28.16 --> 00:13:32.80 where you can have more control and mitigate the damage that he's doing to the country. That's
00:13:32.80 --> 00:13:37.84 a possible consideration to take. Maybe you say, okay, you know what, Hitler, I'm going to be
00:13:37.84 --> 00:13:42.24 your guy and I'm going to, you know, I'm going to do things so that way you can rise up in the ranks
00:13:42.24 --> 00:13:48.96 and being a position where you can stop his bad decisions. As opposed to, if you try and kill him,
00:13:48.96 --> 00:13:51.68 you fail, you know, you mean, obviously, once you're dead, you don't have any influence over
00:13:51.68 --> 00:13:55.60 the organization. Same thing if you're in a business, whether something going on and you want to raise
00:13:55.60 --> 00:14:01.28 your hand. And yet if you raise your hand, you know that there's a risk that you might either
00:14:01.28 --> 00:14:06.000 ache, fired or you might get demoted or you might get put out of your leadership position. And
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.72 now you're letting down, now you can't have an influence over the scenario anymore. So that's
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:20.56 that's something to consider as well. It takes a significant level of moral courage to stand up
00:14:20.56 --> 00:14:28.40 in those situations. And you have to be tactful. I think that's important to say, you have to be
00:14:28.40 --> 00:14:33.12 tactful. You have to have, you don't walk in and just start questioning your leadership immediately.
00:14:33.12 --> 00:14:38.96 You have to build a relationship for us. First, you have to grow your trust between each other
00:14:38.96 --> 00:14:46.56 and then once you have that, you can then tactfully bring up questions and try and get
00:14:47.92 --> 00:14:52.96 to the bottom of why things are happening or why things are being done a certain way or another way.
00:14:54.64 --> 00:14:58.16 Question your leadership. And if you're a leader, don't get offended when you get questioned.
00:14:58.16 --> 00:15:06.24 Be happy. Be happy. Even when your kids do it. Even when your kids do it, especially when your
00:15:06.24 --> 00:15:10.64 kids do it. Yeah. Because you always want to take that easy out. Just do what I told you to do.
00:15:10.64 --> 00:15:15.92 Yeah, I do it. I said that. It's different than what I said. You caught yourself.
00:15:15.92 --> 00:15:20.48 Yeah, I played that for a day. Self policing over there. Outstanding.
00:15:20.48 --> 00:15:27.84 What about when they always add the kids? What they always say why. And then,
00:15:28.40 --> 00:15:31.92 you just think you gotta be careful. I'm speaking from experience. You know how, you know
00:15:31.92 --> 00:15:37.92 the whole, this is old school. Like, oh, why? Oh, because of this, why? Why? And then, it gets fun to
00:15:37.92 --> 00:15:41.44 them just to say why. They don't even want to know why it now. It just becomes a game. Then what
00:15:41.44 --> 00:15:45.92 just shut it right down. Well, that's when you should just keep, oh, it's me against you. No,
00:15:45.92 --> 00:15:51.12 no, just go to your to one of them. You ask why you asked them a question back.
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.12 Why do you think it goes that way? And then, let's say, well, I don't know. Well, why? Why don't you know?
00:15:57.12 --> 00:16:03.92 Just one sweep. Yeah. Yeah. It's a sweep. Yeah. It's a good one. Yeah. It's a really good
00:16:03.92 --> 00:16:07.04 action. Speaking from experience, I got four kids.
00:16:10.24 --> 00:16:13.20 All right. Good. Thank you for that. Next question.
00:16:13.20 --> 00:16:19.84 Joko, you say, Jitsu makes you humble. Why do some Jitsu instructors and many Jitsu practitioners
00:16:19.84 --> 00:16:26.000 act like complete arrogant? Jers. Oh, yeah. That's a good one. That's a great question.
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.52 And we haven't really talked about, have we talked about, I don't think we've talked about that.
00:16:29.52 --> 00:16:36.64 Now, I've talked about how some like, there's bad, there's bad apples in the Jitsu community
00:16:36.64 --> 00:16:41.68 for sure. But the way that the way that I talk about the Jitsu and the way we talk about it,
00:16:41.68 --> 00:16:50.24 like everybody that does Jitsu should be some Buddha like enlightened being at one with the universe.
00:16:51.76 --> 00:16:56.40 And totally free of any ego, because that's what we talk about, Jitsu. But
00:16:58.40 --> 00:17:01.28 like I said, I've talked about the fact that there's definitely bad people in Jitsu. And that's
00:17:01.28 --> 00:17:08.48 why you need to be careful when you're, you know, Jitsu should not be a cult. You, you should not
00:17:08.48 --> 00:17:13.92 be worshiping your instructor. Your instructor is a human being. There's been Jitsu people that
00:17:13.92 --> 00:17:19.12 have been wrapped up in all kinds of terrible stuff that every kind of crime you can imagine. So again,
00:17:19.68 --> 00:17:24.16 just like a person in the military, just like a seal, just like being in the seal teams doesn't
00:17:24.16 --> 00:17:29.52 make you a good person. It applies to everything else. Jitsu, just because you do,
00:17:29.52 --> 00:17:32.08 you do, you do, you do, you just because you're a black phone, you just doesn't make you a good person.
00:17:32.08 --> 00:17:40.40 Yeah, you, you, you, you're, you're a, you're a good person. There's plenty of
00:17:42.56 --> 00:17:48.56 malevolent people out there that wear the cloth of God, but actually practice the work of Satan.
00:17:49.60 --> 00:17:54.96 So you have to apply that rule to everything. And it's definitely the same with Jitsu. And Jitsu,
00:17:56.56 --> 00:18:00.32 Jitsu is a power. It's a position of power. When you're good at it, you have some power over
00:18:00.32 --> 00:18:09.44 other people and some people are going to abuse that power. If you have the right mindset,
00:18:09.44 --> 00:18:14.96 Jitsu is extremely humbling because you realize that what you realize when you do Jitsu is that you
00:18:14.96 --> 00:18:21.36 can be beat by other people. That's what you realize. And it, for the most part, as a broad
00:18:21.36 --> 00:18:28.08 generalization, if another human has been training longer than you, they can beat you. And this is
00:18:28.08 --> 00:18:33.52 especially in the beginning of Jitsu, right? Once you have, once you get further along, it's that gap
00:18:33.52 --> 00:18:38.16 closes up. But in general, if someone's been training six months and you've been training one,
00:18:38.16 --> 00:18:43.60 you're going to get beat. There's very few exceptions to that. If you've been training for a year
00:18:43.60 --> 00:18:46.64 and someone's been training for one month, you're going to beat that person that's been training
00:18:46.64 --> 00:18:51.60 for one month. That's just, and, and that covers a huge, that covers all kinds of weight classes and
00:18:51.60 --> 00:18:56.64 athletic ability and all that stuff. The great athlete total stud can, if you've been training
00:18:56.64 --> 00:19:00.32 for one month and you've got someone that's been training for a year, year and a half, it's going to be a problem.
00:19:01.92 --> 00:19:12.000 So, if you realize that when you start, that makes you humble. And if you remember that as you get
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:20.40 better, it will keep you humble if you don't forget that. But what happens is sometimes people
00:19:20.40 --> 00:19:27.44 forget that it's Jitsu that gives them the power to submit other people and it's not their power.
00:19:28.24 --> 00:19:36.24 Right? It's not their power. They believe that they are the power of Jitsu. They think it's them.
00:19:36.24 --> 00:19:40.48 And so they think they're better than anyone else. And that's what that is. That's arrogance.
00:19:40.48 --> 00:19:45.60 That's what it is. And it's ugly. And I think really, if I was to drill down,
00:19:45.60 --> 00:19:53.20 I would say it's caused by people that are number one insecure. They're insecure. So,
00:19:53.20 --> 00:19:58.64 they just, they get this thing that they can dominate other people and they relish it. Or,
00:20:00.24 --> 00:20:07.60 you know, also, people that are just like not that smart. Right? They don't realize,
00:20:07.60 --> 00:20:11.76 they don't, they don't put two and two together. That like, oh, the reason I'm better,
00:20:11.76 --> 00:20:17.44 the reason I can choke this person is because I've been training longer than them. That doesn't
00:20:17.44 --> 00:20:21.92 make me a better human being. It just means I'm better at this one aspect of being a human being.
00:20:23.52 --> 00:20:30.32 So, I would say those are, yeah, those are some of the reasons. And if you end up at a school
00:20:30.32 --> 00:20:34.48 where people are arrogant, just don't train there. Go to different school. Yeah.
00:20:34.48 --> 00:20:39.04 It's like the only school option you have. And if it's getting in your way, I mean,
00:20:39.04 --> 00:20:45.52 because there's a different, let's face it like being arrogant is kind of strong. But,
00:20:46.40 --> 00:20:50.72 being not humble in these teeny tiny little ways, you run into that all the time. Just these
00:20:50.72 --> 00:20:56.32 small ways, you're still within the jujitsu community though. So, you know, this guy may always talk
00:20:56.32 --> 00:21:00.24 about how good his triangle choke is or something like this, you know, this stuff. And that's not
00:21:00.24 --> 00:21:04.000 to mention like, that's not offensive though. Yeah, exactly. Is it okay? No. Yeah, I'm not a fan
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.56 of that. But I probably tell you, yeah, you do have a good. Yeah. But you know how guys will brag and,
00:21:08.56 --> 00:21:13.68 you know, be like, oh, it's not tournament or something like that. It doesn't scream humble.
00:21:13.68 --> 00:21:18.48 You know, it doesn't necessarily. So, maybe like that expectation, whatever. Okay. I think
00:21:19.36 --> 00:21:25.04 you kind of got to make a concession for those sorts of things. Yes. Absolutely. Like, you know,
00:21:25.04 --> 00:21:28.64 this is something I talk about. It's a dichotomy leadership, it's a dichotomy of the ego, right?
00:21:29.20 --> 00:21:31.68 You don't want to go to a school where no one cares if they went to lose it. You want to go to
00:21:31.68 --> 00:21:35.68 a school where, like, where, hey, when we train here, we're training to beat each other. Like we're
00:21:35.68 --> 00:21:40.32 training to win. Yeah. When you win, you're happy. There's ego on the map for sure. My ego's on the map.
00:21:40.32 --> 00:21:44.96 I don't want to lose it. Don't like to tap it. Don't, you know, it's a great. But I mean, at the same
00:21:44.96 --> 00:21:49.76 time, I love to tap because that means I'm learning. But you don't, so that's that's acceptable.
00:21:49.76 --> 00:21:53.76 Like that's, of course. Yeah, you want to train a place where there's competitiveness in the school.
00:21:53.76 --> 00:21:56.96 Yeah. But this is totally different. This is, you know, when you get people that are just
00:21:56.96 --> 00:22:01.60 arrogant, you're extremely, they're definitely out there. Most, I don't know, I don't know.
00:22:01.60 --> 00:22:05.60 What do I say most? That's the way it should be. They haven't learned to get too correctly.
00:22:06.16 --> 00:22:10.64 Yeah. That's not what your juts is meant to be. I think you're in my opinion. 100% rate when you
00:22:10.64 --> 00:22:15.68 say it's like an insecure person and not the kind of broken insecure. It's just, you know, like someone
00:22:15.68 --> 00:22:19.52 who's saying, just live in an insecure, you know, someone comes in, like, especially if you're in
00:22:19.52 --> 00:22:24.96 like a certain type of instructor and you're used to like everyone just listening to every word you
00:22:24.96 --> 00:22:30.80 say and then, I don't know, a student or someone comes with something different than what you said.
00:22:30.80 --> 00:22:34.40 Or the opposite of what you said or something that kind of indicates that what you said is
00:22:34.40 --> 00:22:38.40 100% correct is like boom, you're going to defend that little position that you've kind of grown
00:22:38.40 --> 00:22:42.64 accustomed to, you know, especially if you're even a little bit insecure, you're going to at least
00:22:42.64 --> 00:22:47.12 have those feelings. So, and it's interesting how that even that this, due to it's who wants to get
00:22:47.12 --> 00:22:52.16 reflects leadership in life. If you get a guy, if you get an instructor that gets shown to move,
00:22:52.16 --> 00:22:56.72 but it's not his move and he gets mad about it, like your respect for the instructor goes down.
00:22:56.72 --> 00:23:00.48 It does go up. If you get a guy that goes, wow, that's awesome. Let me see that again. Let me
00:23:00.48 --> 00:23:03.44 learn that. Let me incorporate that in my game. That's a great thing. Thanks for showing me.
00:23:03.44 --> 00:23:07.04 Yeah. You're respect for that teacher goes up because you recognize that they're humble,
00:23:07.04 --> 00:23:10.32 that they're evolving, that they want to learn, that they have an open mind, which is what you want
00:23:10.32 --> 00:23:15.20 to see in your leaders and in your digital instructors. Boom. Yeah. So funny. Adam,
00:23:15.20 --> 00:23:22.56 amazing. Amazing. Coach Adam. Coach Adam. Yeah. So he, I came in one time. He's teaching this move.
00:23:23.92 --> 00:23:29.20 And he, you know, he teach really good. I was like, yeah, it's a good move, you know, and he's teaching it.
00:23:29.20 --> 00:23:35.68 And when he explained what this move was, it was a move that he just got beat with in a tournament
00:23:35.68 --> 00:23:42.40 that someone else did and obviously was really good. And to me that you're never the move.
00:23:42.40 --> 00:23:46.96 Yeah. Yeah. It was like, you're similar to the, remember back in the day Frank
00:23:46.96 --> 00:23:52.64 Mir got this guy named Pete, big tall guy, Pete. This old school UFC. Oh yeah. Yeah.
00:23:52.64 --> 00:23:58.000 Pete. Oh, this is maniac. Maniac. Maniac. Wasn't the maniac. The twist is on. Right. Is like an
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.08 Americana in an arm lock position. Yeah. Overhook, you know, from the car. Yeah. It was kind of like
00:24:02.08 --> 00:24:07.68 that, but it was a straight arm lock. Yeah. And the guy's name was Philippe. Oh, really? Wasn't
00:24:07.68 --> 00:24:14.32 it to himself, yeah. No, it was old. And the UFC was, it was Frank Mir did it to Pete. I think
00:24:14.32 --> 00:24:18.32 the name is Pete. He was a San Diego that actually. Oh, okay. He was old. I thought it was to have. I thought
00:24:18.32 --> 00:24:23.12 it was to have. No, Tim Sylvia's, he broke his arm and it's shallow arm bar. Oh, that, you might be
00:24:23.12 --> 00:24:29.04 thinking about that. But nonetheless, when Adam got hit with it in the tournament, it was against
00:24:29.04 --> 00:24:37.44 getting fully, Gracie Bogger. Anyway. So to me, when Adam decides to teach that move, that was like the
00:24:37.44 --> 00:24:42.64 opposite of what this arrogance is. It's not like, oh, it make a bunch of excuses and dismiss it
00:24:42.64 --> 00:24:46.88 because I'm dope. You know, and that was just so, you know, once in a lifetime, he was like, man,
00:24:46.88 --> 00:24:53.12 this is a legitimate move. They worked on me by the way. And that's not to mention getting over the
00:24:53.12 --> 00:24:57.28 fact that you lost an tournament and then now you're going to kind of revisit the whole situation by
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.52 glorifying the move, kind of thing. So that's like the ultimate in humility, my opinion. There you go.
00:25:03.52 --> 00:25:08.32 But it makes sense. I mean, not to say it's good or it's like an exuser or it's fine or not or even
00:25:08.32 --> 00:25:12.56 acceptable or whatever, but it does make sense though, even like competitors, you know, like,
00:25:12.56 --> 00:25:16.88 I got it. He said practitioners, but maybe competitors or whatever were, you know, you have the
00:25:16.88 --> 00:25:21.28 competitive aspect of it. And so you're going to talk a high game about your jiu-jitsu, you know,
00:25:21.28 --> 00:25:27.36 that's kind of hot is or whatever. To be an arrogant jerk though, that, that, that, I think that's
00:25:27.36 --> 00:25:32.24 like something that the human being brought into jiu-jitsu, you know, and then the jiu-jitsu kind of just
00:25:32.24 --> 00:25:37.36 mixed it, you know, mixed it. That's what I think. There's what I think is what it seems like anyway,
00:25:37.36 --> 00:25:42.88 but I think for the most part, when you start jiu-jitsu, it makes you more humble than you were before,
00:25:42.88 --> 00:25:48.08 100% because of that reason. It really should. And if it doesn't, you're wrong. Yeah.
00:25:48.96 --> 00:25:54.000 Even, I mean, it's hard. It's hard to imagine how it wouldn't even like in an exceptional.
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.40 No, it's because when people start to get good at it and then they forget what it was like,
00:25:58.40 --> 00:26:03.44 yes, that's true. That's true. That's true. That's what happens. And then it comes biting you one day.
00:26:03.44 --> 00:26:07.84 You know, you know, you know what, but it's, these guys in here's the thing, when you've been in the
00:26:07.84 --> 00:26:11.68 game long enough, you see this super clear too, right? So let's say you get this, I don't know, this,
00:26:11.68 --> 00:26:17.04 this is a straw man, by the way. So you get this guy, he gets humble, right? He starts to just
00:26:17.04 --> 00:26:20.88 see you get humble. He gets good at you. Just do good at moves. He's tapping everybody out. Now he's
00:26:20.88 --> 00:26:25.92 in arrogant jerk. Now when these other big dogs start coming in, he avoids rolling with
00:26:25.92 --> 00:26:30.48 the other one. If you doesn't roll with the higher belt, he doesn't compete. Nothing like that.
00:26:30.48 --> 00:26:35.36 He only rolls with the lower belt. He's the same. You can do that. But here's the thing when people do that.
00:26:35.36 --> 00:26:41.84 It's so obvious. So obvious. Man, I remember when I started you to and this was like a few,
00:26:41.84 --> 00:26:46.08 like a year or two years in, I remember being kind of apprehensive, not apprehensive, kind of scared,
00:26:46.08 --> 00:26:51.84 actually in Endless working at the club where you kind of walk around and, you know, in the
00:26:51.84 --> 00:26:55.44 that club situation, it's that you can't know if it can be like, you don't know if this guy knows
00:26:55.44 --> 00:27:01.52 you're exactly men and where he, where it's like man, I got his humble. Yes, 100% and man, if there's
00:27:01.52 --> 00:27:05.52 not even a little bit of that in your head, it's like man, something must be weird. Because even
00:27:05.52 --> 00:27:09.44 me, I walk around like, hey, I'm pretty good at just you, but there may be somebody out there that's
00:27:09.44 --> 00:27:14.40 better. Yeah. I mean, what are you going to do? So be careful, he run your mouth too. How's that?
00:27:14.40 --> 00:27:18.72 How much tree people respect? How's that? Sounds like a good idea, man. And that's the result of being
00:27:18.72 --> 00:27:24.24 humble, then humility in general. Man, I think about it though, in the night club, like everyone's
00:27:24.24 --> 00:27:27.76 crunchesize you in each other up and it's kind of this thing, that's the climate. And also what
00:27:27.76 --> 00:27:33.52 it feels like, man, I remember thinking like this skinny guy right here, especially a tall skinny guy,
00:27:33.52 --> 00:27:38.64 who in, if you didn't know about you, just a tall skinny guy, there's one other than a non-fact,
00:27:38.64 --> 00:27:43.36 they're kind of thing. But now it's like, man, if you get caught in a arm bar, a choke in on the,
00:27:43.36 --> 00:27:50.64 you know, on the streets, so to speak, right here in big trouble. Huge trouble. Stay humble. Stay humble.
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.44 But yes, that's the explanation I agree with you 100%. Next question. Next question.
00:27:57.44 --> 00:28:02.32 Next question. Well, let's talk about you do some more, some more because I could, if you want,
00:28:02.32 --> 00:28:09.60 we could, you could, at least in. Next question, when you grow in size in an organization,
00:28:09.60 --> 00:28:15.20 do you have to change the principles of combat leadership from extreme ownership or adopt new ones?
00:28:18.56 --> 00:28:23.60 No. Oh, wait, so I, but I asked this kind of, we, and I, you know,
00:28:23.60 --> 00:28:28.48 like, do you have to do any, either either of these, right? That's kind of the, the question.
00:28:28.48 --> 00:28:35.52 Do you have to change the principles or adopt new ones? Do you have to do that? No, the answer is no.
00:28:35.52 --> 00:28:40.40 As a matter of fact, when your organization gets bigger, the only change you have to make is
00:28:41.44 --> 00:28:47.20 to get better at the laws of combat. That's what you have to do. So, as you grow,
00:28:48.40 --> 00:28:51.84 you have to work harder to build relationships with other divisions so that you can cover
00:28:51.84 --> 00:28:56.40 and move for each other, right? That's, that's, that's a given. You have to get better at keeping
00:28:56.40 --> 00:29:02.16 things simple because the message has to be spread to more people. So word has to be spread
00:29:02.16 --> 00:29:07.44 that is simple clear and concise. That makes sense. You have to learn how to prioritize an
00:29:07.44 --> 00:29:14.40 execute better because there's a larger group of people that have to shift their focus on
00:29:14.40 --> 00:29:17.52 whatever priorities coming out. It's that you have a bigger ship to turn.
00:29:19.04 --> 00:29:23.92 And you have to do this accurately and quickly and there's less room for error in shifting
00:29:23.92 --> 00:29:27.76 priorities when you have a bigger organization. And of course, for decentralized command,
00:29:27.76 --> 00:29:34.48 you have to get better to that because in a small organization, it's pretty easy, right? You don't
00:29:34.48 --> 00:29:39.28 really, you don't really have to do decentralized command. If you've got five people working for you,
00:29:39.28 --> 00:29:43.44 you can actually just control. You don't really have to use decentralized command. It's a place to
00:29:43.44 --> 00:29:50.16 begin it and instill that culture, but you can get away without it because you can actually,
00:29:50.16 --> 00:29:54.64 you can actually watch everyone. You can direct everyone. You can influence everyone and you
00:29:54.64 --> 00:29:58.32 can actually lead them directly when you're in a small organization. So you don't have to be all
00:29:58.32 --> 00:30:02.48 that great at decentralized command. But as you get bigger, you just can't do that anymore.
00:30:03.36 --> 00:30:09.20 So the only way to watch everyone and direct everyone and influence everyone and lead everyone,
00:30:09.20 --> 00:30:14.32 the only way to do that is through your subordinate leadership is through decentralized command.
00:30:14.32 --> 00:30:21.92 So you have to be better at that. Now, I will say that the one thing that you may be have to
00:30:21.92 --> 00:30:27.52 adjust, it's not really a principle, but you are going to have to look at your communication
00:30:28.80 --> 00:30:33.20 methods. You're going to have to look at your communication methods. You just aren't going to be
00:30:33.20 --> 00:30:37.60 able to meet with everyone face to face anymore. You don't have time when you're organizing,
00:30:37.60 --> 00:30:42.16 when your organization gets big enough, you won't. There'll be employees there and subordinate
00:30:42.16 --> 00:30:47.76 leaders that you'll never see. Maybe some, you know, some that you've never been on a call with.
00:30:47.76 --> 00:30:52.96 So how do you get the message? How do you get the mission all the way through the organization?
00:30:53.76 --> 00:30:58.16 We have to do with decentralized command, but how do you communicate it? And my thing is always like you
00:30:58.16 --> 00:31:04.40 have to communicate in every available method and the bigger you get. The more the larger your
00:31:04.40 --> 00:31:08.56 organization is, you have to take advantage of everything, you have to take advantage of calls of emails,
00:31:08.56 --> 00:31:14.48 of meetings, of physical documents that you know, you put out and say, have you read this and
00:31:14.48 --> 00:31:19.84 you make videos? I'm making that recommendation a lot now to big larger organizations that I work with
00:31:19.84 --> 00:31:25.04 is wider, you know, I'll ask them how often are you having an all hands-type meeting? Well,
00:31:25.04 --> 00:31:28.48 it's really hard because you can't really get face to face to everyone because we've got
00:31:28.48 --> 00:31:31.84 multiple different, not only multiple different areas, but we got multiple different times on
00:31:31.84 --> 00:31:34.64 so if we want, you know, you got someone on the other side of the ocean,
00:31:34.64 --> 00:31:38.64 hey, we're going to have a meeting at a reasonable time. It's impossible to have everyone at a reasonable
00:31:38.64 --> 00:31:42.32 time. So what do you do? Okay, eventually it's okay. Well, why don't you make videos?
00:31:42.32 --> 00:31:46.32 Make it make a, make a four minute video that everyone can see and understand and see where the
00:31:46.32 --> 00:31:51.52 vision's going. So all these, every different communication methods that you can hit all the different
00:31:51.52 --> 00:31:55.60 types of people because there's some people that like to read emails. There's something that won't
00:31:55.60 --> 00:32:00.32 watch a video, but they'll read a email, they'll read a document. There's some people that will not
00:32:00.32 --> 00:32:05.20 sit in a conference call, but they'll go through the notes that get sent out a bridge notes.
00:32:05.20 --> 00:32:11.12 So there's all kinds of ways to communicate in my advice is to use them all, but the fundamental
00:32:11.12 --> 00:32:17.12 principles of leadership itself don't change. So don't just stick to them, actually get better and
00:32:17.12 --> 00:32:25.04 pay more attention to them. Check. Decentralized, command. That seems like the one, but actually
00:32:25.04 --> 00:32:32.24 know what now that you kind of explain it. They'll seem pretty important. Well, they are all important
00:32:32.24 --> 00:32:40.08 and there's, and they are, it's interesting. They're, they're actually in order. What they're actually
00:32:40.08 --> 00:32:43.60 in order, well, they're in order the way we wrote them in the middle of the way I originally talked
00:32:43.60 --> 00:32:46.64 about them. It's like the number one cover move. If you're not doing that steam work, if you're not doing
00:32:46.64 --> 00:32:52.000 that, you're not going to do anything. Number two is you got to keep things simple. Like you have to do that
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.96 because you can't cover move for someone else if you don't even understand what's going on.
00:32:54.96 --> 00:32:58.80 So it's got to be simple. And then prioritize next to you. Well, there's going to be things that
00:32:58.80 --> 00:33:01.76 are changed, things that are dynamic. And so the next thing you've got to worry about is like when
00:33:01.76 --> 00:33:06.40 things change, how are you going to prioritize what's changing, how are you going to handle these problems?
00:33:06.40 --> 00:33:12.88 But then the last one is decentralized command, which is now that you've got those other four
00:33:12.88 --> 00:33:20.000 kind of stable. Now you can start really leading properly. But for your, to your credit, if you flip
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:27.20 those upside down, in order of sort of broad organizational importance decentralized command is the
00:33:27.20 --> 00:33:32.56 most important. One, now you're not going to have it without the other three. Prioritized next
00:33:32.56 --> 00:33:36.72 cute is the next important one from an organizational perspective. Keeping things simple is
00:33:36.72 --> 00:33:41.28 then the next one. And so if you flip them upside down as an organization, the level of importance
00:33:41.28 --> 00:33:48.32 inside the organization is reversed, but the way that you have to implement them. And the, and you,
00:33:48.32 --> 00:33:51.28 the bottom lines, you'll never get to decentralized command if you can't keep things simple.
00:33:51.28 --> 00:33:56.48 We don't come in. So you can't get there. But in order to build them, so in order to build them,
00:33:56.48 --> 00:34:00.72 you have to kind of use in order. But then when you look at them, when you look at them from the
00:34:00.72 --> 00:34:07.04 importance of how well they make a team function. Again, if you can't cover and move it all or you
00:34:07.04 --> 00:34:10.000 can't keep things simple, you'll never get to decentralized command. But you have someone that's
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.24 working them all and they're all doing well. Well, then the most important one is decentralized command.
00:34:14.24 --> 00:34:18.72 decentralized command is the one that takes you the highest level. Right. It'll have the most impact
00:34:18.72 --> 00:34:23.52 on your organization. You'll never get there without the other three. But once you have those three
00:34:23.52 --> 00:34:27.84 and you, you implement decentralized command, you'll be absolutely that'll be the most powerful
00:34:27.84 --> 00:34:31.52 thing in your organization. You can't do without the other three. It's the strongest, but it's
00:34:31.52 --> 00:34:38.48 doesn't matter without the other three. Yeah. Just check. That's a question.
00:34:38.48 --> 00:34:46.16 Joko, how does your quote unquote play the game? Play the games in terms of completing the goal
00:34:46.16 --> 00:34:53.36 fit in with Jordan Peterson's agreeableness in terms of career advancement. Is it a case of
00:34:53.36 --> 00:35:00.56 right time right agreeableness? So this comes from Jordan Peterson talking about how people that
00:35:00.56 --> 00:35:11.04 are more agreeable have less success in promotion and salary than someone that is more assertive.
00:35:11.84 --> 00:35:17.36 So it's a really good question because this person is taking what I talk about, which is play the
00:35:17.36 --> 00:35:24.96 game. And thinking that that means agreeableness and it does to some extent. It absolutely does to some
00:35:24.96 --> 00:35:31.20 extent. And so that's a really good question. And the answer is that there's a dichotomy to this,
00:35:31.20 --> 00:35:36.000 that they're like like all of life and like all of business and like all of leadership. There's
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:43.28 dichotomy because while while someone that is agreeable, like like very agreeable, certainly
00:35:43.28 --> 00:35:49.12 has less of a chance of career advancement than someone that is assertive. Right? That makes sense. Like
00:35:49.12 --> 00:35:54.000 if you never say, hey, I'll do that or hey, let me handle that project. If you don't ever do that,
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.08 and someone says, hey, no, I'll do this. And you go, okay, that's fine. And we're going to promote
00:35:58.08 --> 00:36:02.000 this guy. Oh, okay, that's fine. You know, if you're that agreeable, well, yeah, it's going to be problematic.
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.88 But also, when in when assertiveness turns into overly aggressive, the chances of advancement start
00:36:08.88 --> 00:36:13.92 to go back down again and when you take someone that's when you get to someone that is ultra aggressive
00:36:13.92 --> 00:36:18.56 and rubbs people the wrong way and won't do any compromising, that person's going to be at the same
00:36:18.56 --> 00:36:22.96 person, the same level of this advancement is someone that's super agreeable or at least in the same
00:36:22.96 --> 00:36:27.44 ballpark, they'll be close if they still have a job at all, by the way, because someone that's,
00:36:27.44 --> 00:36:30.96 you know, overly aggressive and won't compromise with anyone and calls everyone out.
00:36:31.92 --> 00:36:36.000 The, if they're the complete far end of the spectrum opposite to agreeable,
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.04 that's going to be a problem. So, so when I talk about playing the game, I'm, I'm definitely
00:36:41.04 --> 00:36:45.76 talking about being agreeable because I'm telling you to be more agreeable, right? When you don't
00:36:45.76 --> 00:36:49.12 play the game, it's like, hey, we're going to think this, we're going to run this new project. That's
00:36:49.12 --> 00:36:54.88 project is stupid. Mm-hmm. Well, an agreeable person would say, okay, well, that sounds good,
00:36:54.88 --> 00:36:59.12 where we go with this. Now, an agreeable person that's too agreeable might go down the road of
00:36:59.12 --> 00:37:03.52 something that's not a good plan. But if you're overly aggressive, if you're not playing the
00:37:03.52 --> 00:37:11.28 great game at all, you're not going to get past go, right? So, when I say play the game,
00:37:11.28 --> 00:37:15.12 I am talking about being a girl now, talking to someone the other day who's pretty hardcore
00:37:15.12 --> 00:37:19.84 and he was feeling some heat from his boss in the company that I was working with and he wanted
00:37:19.84 --> 00:37:29.28 to fight back, wanted to fight back, hashtag recessed. And you want to fight back, you want to go beyond
00:37:29.28 --> 00:37:35.84 resist, you want to go like into the aggressive mode. And I told him, don't fight back, I said,
00:37:35.84 --> 00:37:39.60 play the game. And he sort of got aggressive because he said he's pretty hardcore guy, he started
00:37:39.60 --> 00:37:46.000 getting aggressive with me and saying, oh, that's what I should do now bow down, it gets the ring.
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.68 I'm not going to do that. I'm a man, right? It came at me with that, with that angle. And then he said,
00:37:51.68 --> 00:37:57.12 this, which was interesting. He goes, you know, he said something along once, but you would take this kind
00:37:57.12 --> 00:38:03.60 of crap, why should I? And I stayed quiet for a minute. I heard him say that, and I was like, oh,
00:38:03.60 --> 00:38:11.20 you just serve me up all soft. And then, you know, I took a big breath and I'm like, you have no idea.
00:38:12.56 --> 00:38:19.28 You have no idea the things that I have done, the pride that I have swallowed, the dumb jokes.
00:38:19.28 --> 00:38:25.44 I've laughed at the idiotic plans of supported the insane lengths that I had to go through
00:38:25.44 --> 00:38:34.56 out my career, my entire career to win, to win in the end. That was my goal. And in order to win,
00:38:34.56 --> 00:38:40.24 you kind of play the game. You got to massage some egos. You have to accept some things that you
00:38:40.24 --> 00:38:46.80 normally might not accept. You have to eat some humble pie some from time to time and what you're
00:38:46.80 --> 00:38:51.92 doing and why you do those things is so that you can build, so that you can build confidence with
00:38:51.92 --> 00:38:57.36 your boss. That's what you're doing. So you can build trust with your boss. And you do that.
00:38:58.24 --> 00:39:04.000 So that in the end, if your boss is not a good guy, you can actually beat the boss. You can win.
00:39:06.40 --> 00:39:09.92 But you can't win if you don't play the game. You'll lose before you even start. So play the
00:39:09.92 --> 00:39:16.56 game. That's what I told this guy. Right? Now, can you do you have the balance this? Yes, you absolutely
00:39:16.56 --> 00:39:22.16 do because if you become a sick event and you just become a brown noseer, am I talking about
00:39:22.16 --> 00:39:28.88 becoming a brown noseer? No. Because if you do that, you're losing clouds and influence with your
00:39:28.88 --> 00:39:33.52 with your team or with your subordinates or with your peers because you're brown noseing the boss
00:39:33.52 --> 00:39:39.36 and you're losing cloud there. So you have to, and you won't win because those guys are going to
00:39:39.36 --> 00:39:46.32 get past it to you. They're not going to support you. So I'm not saying you go overboard. You have to
00:39:46.32 --> 00:39:55.20 have balance. You have to know when to say yes, when to a piece. I built so much cloud. I built cloud
00:39:55.92 --> 00:40:00.56 by doing things that people wanted me to do that. Maybe I was kind of a weird project or they
00:40:00.56 --> 00:40:03.92 want me to try some piece of equipment. It's like cool. Yeah, I'll try it. We'll write you a
00:40:03.92 --> 00:40:07.12 good report about it. You know what I mean? Like, oh yeah, you want me to try some new tack.
00:40:07.12 --> 00:40:10.72 Cool. We'll give you a try. In my mind, I'm thinking this is dumb. But you know what?
00:40:10.72 --> 00:40:14.16 Hey, let's give it a try. Oh, you know what? We didn't work as well as I was hoping it would.
00:40:14.16 --> 00:40:18.16 But you know, here's some points. We took away from it. Okay. The guy at least said as opposed to saying
00:40:18.16 --> 00:40:26.56 that new tactic is stupid. Your plan is dumb. Okay. I'm disagreeable. What's that going to get me?
00:40:27.52 --> 00:40:33.52 It's not going to get. I'm being too assertive. I'm being too aggressive. So you have to,
00:40:33.52 --> 00:40:37.68 you have to balance it. You have to know when to tactfully stand up and disagree with someone
00:40:38.64 --> 00:40:42.16 instead of being totally agreeable all the time. I'm not talking about being agreeable all the time.
00:40:42.16 --> 00:40:46.56 I'm talking about balance. I sort of'm talking about and that's playing the game.
00:40:47.76 --> 00:40:59.20 So playing the game is not being a submissive agreeable. Baby, right? That's not playing the game.
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:06.48 Playing the game is playing balance is knowing when is building trust. It's doing some dumb things,
00:41:06.48 --> 00:41:11.68 showing respect and just playing the game. And you're playing the game to win. That's what you're
00:41:11.68 --> 00:41:18.96 playing the game for. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I get it. You know, playing the game, you know,
00:41:18.96 --> 00:41:25.36 maybe got viewed as like being agreeable. But when Jordan Peterson talks about agreeableness,
00:41:25.36 --> 00:41:29.52 he's talking about a personality trait. He's not talking about some action you took to do something.
00:41:29.52 --> 00:41:34.32 Oh, yeah. But agreeableness has resulting actions if you're an agreeable person. Yeah.
00:41:34.32 --> 00:41:38.80 Yeah. But when it comes when it stems from a personality trait, that means just like I
00:41:38.80 --> 00:41:43.28 you said, like you're going to be agreeable for the most part regardless. Like I forget what the
00:41:44.08 --> 00:41:48.40 the other trait was is called about, you know, success when you're talking about that. But
00:41:48.40 --> 00:41:52.72 nonetheless, like if you're talking about playing the game, meaning sure you might have to
00:41:52.72 --> 00:41:57.28 display some agreeableness everyone's in a while to kind of size it when you have to or when you
00:41:57.28 --> 00:42:01.76 you know, when it's useful. That does not mean you're an agreeable person as a personality trait. That's
00:42:01.76 --> 00:42:06.40 true. Way too different completely different thing. I'm definitely not. I'm definitely not
00:42:06.40 --> 00:42:10.96 saying that you're going to be able to train your change your personality. Yeah. Because I'm not a
00:42:10.96 --> 00:42:14.96 very agreeable person. I agree with people all day long. Right. Why? Because I'm trying to win.
00:42:14.96 --> 00:42:19.12 That's the point exactly. Right. I actually disagree with 89% of the things that I hear on a daily basis.
00:42:20.56 --> 00:42:24.64 You know what I mean? I'm literally trying to figure out right now as I'm thinking about this.
00:42:24.64 --> 00:42:29.20 So many things I disagree with. There's two things that are going on. Number one, this is this is
00:42:29.20 --> 00:42:36.08 straight up. Number one, if you give me an idea. And I go, that's dumb echo. Number one, I'm
00:42:36.08 --> 00:42:41.60 arrogant. I'm not listening. I'm I'm shutting the idea out. When your idea might have some good
00:42:41.60 --> 00:42:47.60 traits to it. Number two, your pissed. Yeah. Right. I didn't gather any cloud with you. I didn't build
00:42:47.60 --> 00:42:51.68 our relationship at all. I just said like, hey, that's a dumb idea. No, so instead of me, okay, we'll tell
00:42:51.68 --> 00:42:57.04 me about it. Tell me, like, how would you, how would you implement this idea of yours? Because maybe
00:42:57.04 --> 00:43:01.12 it could have some good benefit. I could see where you're coming from on this. Yeah. Well, now I'm
00:43:01.12 --> 00:43:06.56 building our relationship and you're thinking that, hey, this guy listens to me and that's what I like
00:43:06.56 --> 00:43:10.88 and someone I work with. Someone that listens to me. So those are the kind of things that we're talking
00:43:10.88 --> 00:43:16.000 about. I'm not talking about changing your personality. I'm a disagreeable, I'm a disagreeable human being.
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.40 But I don't show that very often. I don't, there's something I was talking about. I was talking
00:43:20.40 --> 00:43:23.68 about this. Who's I talking to? I forget what I was talking to, but I was talking about how
00:43:25.04 --> 00:43:29.44 I never, ever. Like, there's some things that really bothered me. Sure. In the world,
00:43:29.44 --> 00:43:34.72 I never tell anyone what they are. I will not. I'll go to the, maybe I'll put like in my last
00:43:34.72 --> 00:43:41.92 will-intestimate things that bothered me. But I will, but, but, but I don't tell anyone. Yeah.
00:43:41.92 --> 00:43:45.20 Why? Well, the main reason is because when you're in the teams and people know what
00:43:45.20 --> 00:43:49.84 I was going to get, they're going to tear you up with that thing. So you will never, I'll never
00:43:49.84 --> 00:43:53.68 say it. Well, tell my kids, don't tell my wife nothing. When something happens that really,
00:43:53.68 --> 00:43:58.40 really bothers me, because I'm disagreeable. I don't like that kind of stuff. Is it like pet
00:43:58.40 --> 00:44:03.92 peep kind of stuff? Or is- All right. Personality traits. I don't like the way people communicate
00:44:03.92 --> 00:44:07.44 sometimes. I don't like little pet peeves that I have of things that people do that I don't like.
00:44:07.44 --> 00:44:12.24 I don't, but no one knows any of them. No one knows that they're all deep undercover. And I will never
00:44:12.24 --> 00:44:15.84 tell anyone what they are. You want to, I feel like you should kind of tell me just so I avoid these
00:44:15.84 --> 00:44:19.28 things because I'm very, very, very, very well in that way. Yeah. I don't want to do that stuff. Like
00:44:19.28 --> 00:44:25.44 if I'm saying, you know, people say, I don't know, no one's saying, no one's saying, or like,
00:44:25.44 --> 00:44:29.84 if I say, like, I say, like, a lot, do you not like that? Is that one of the things? I'll never tell anyone.
00:44:30.96 --> 00:44:38.08 I'll never tell anyone. All right. What's these things are? Cool. You're the target list for you.
00:44:38.08 --> 00:44:45.36 It's not that big. I'm at low risk. I'm still on the radar. I know. I do. Yeah. Hey, everyone,
00:44:45.36 --> 00:44:50.40 play the game, play the game. I know it's everyone wants- Hey, that's the funny things. Everyone thinks
00:44:50.40 --> 00:44:55.20 like, Joc was a core. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, actually, I'm going to play the game.
00:44:55.20 --> 00:44:58.96 Because you know why I'm going to win. That's the difference. I'm going to win. Yeah. That was kind of
00:44:58.96 --> 00:45:03.84 part of your story too. When the guy was, was that a face-to-face thing when you're talking,
00:45:03.84 --> 00:45:07.68 you're talking about the guy. Yes. It was. So there was like a built-in assumption right there.
00:45:07.68 --> 00:45:11.20 Well, you said you wouldn't take that. You wouldn't take that. What do you think? Oh, actually,
00:45:11.20 --> 00:45:15.04 let me tell you what my life has been like. Yeah. And you, and of course they're looking at me now
00:45:15.04 --> 00:45:22.08 and they think, well, he just, he just aggressively crushed everyone on his rise to the top, right?
00:45:22.08 --> 00:45:28.80 Yeah. It's like, no, not true at all. Yeah. Manuvered. Yeah. Like, played the game. Yeah. Nothing wrong with
00:45:28.80 --> 00:45:35.20 playing the game. Yeah. Now, again, this isn't, we're not talking about like you just become a
00:45:35.20 --> 00:45:40.96 kiss ass. That's not what I'm talking about. Yeah. Being a kiss ass is equally bad. Yeah.
00:45:40.96 --> 00:45:46.16 It's equally bad. You lose just as much respect. Yeah. Not only from your peers, not only from
00:45:46.16 --> 00:45:50.32 your subordinates, but also from the person that you're working with. Yeah. They even know your
00:45:50.32 --> 00:45:53.52 kiss ass. And they'll run rough shot all over you. I want to come sign with motion that, like,
00:45:53.52 --> 00:45:56.88 you know what, I want to pull up the other guy because it doesn't really matter. This guy was going
00:45:56.88 --> 00:46:02.72 to get a kiss my ass regardless. Yeah. Because you're too, you're too agreeable. Yeah. So I'm not
00:46:02.72 --> 00:46:08.80 talking about this. This is a dichotomy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Manuvered. Yeah. Manuvered. So you, again,
00:46:08.80 --> 00:46:13.76 the point that I was making that I think there might have been a misunderstanding, given the
00:46:13.76 --> 00:46:18.56 question. Like, play the game isn't the same as this agreeableness that Jordan Peterson is talking
00:46:18.56 --> 00:46:23.12 about. It's different. They're not the same thing. No. They're not the same thing. Like the
00:46:23.12 --> 00:46:27.68 question that he thought it was the same thing. Yeah. He exactly. He thinks that playing the game is
00:46:27.68 --> 00:46:34.08 being a real ball. Yeah. It's not. Yeah. It might sometimes be acting agreeable. It might be a
00:46:34.08 --> 00:46:38.40 green to some things that make you a little bit frustrated. Yeah. But you roll with it.
00:46:38.40 --> 00:46:41.60 You're rolling. Because you know what? You're playing to win. You're playing the long game.
00:46:41.60 --> 00:46:46.000 This is a joke. This conversation we're having with my, with my boss, with my subordinates.
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.36 Yeah. It's a joke. That thing doesn't matter to me. Yeah. Okay. If I win this argument,
00:46:49.36 --> 00:46:53.84 I'm playing this long game over here. Like, when you're watching a driver? No. Come on,
00:46:53.84 --> 00:46:57.92 bro. You're watching a driver. No. I mean, I've seen shows that. Yeah. Okay. So I don't watch the
00:46:57.92 --> 00:47:03.60 right. Well, I do. I mean, my wife does so. Is this so long? I know. So I think it's still on. Yeah.
00:47:03.60 --> 00:47:12.000 Okay. So, survivor playing the game. And that that's a term that is all up in survival. Playing the
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:19.28 game. So, okay. Once around, take too long and survive or but it's, it's totally in line with
00:47:19.28 --> 00:47:24.16 where you're talking about. So survivor, you, you know, they throw in here's what the basis, just the
00:47:24.16 --> 00:47:29.04 prime raw basis of survivor you throw a bunch of people on. I know everyone was a base. Yeah.
00:47:29.04 --> 00:47:35.04 You do some challenges. You vote each other off with certain, you know, advantages. You can win
00:47:35.04 --> 00:47:42.48 in what not. Right. We'll reward whatever you mean. So, and how it turned itself like what it morphed
00:47:42.48 --> 00:47:47.36 kind of into just by nature is like this little political game within the game. Right. And now it's just a
00:47:47.36 --> 00:47:54.32 huge overt part of survivor, the political game. I'm playing the game. I'm building alliances. I'm doing
00:47:54.32 --> 00:47:58.96 all this stuff or whatever. It's just exact same thing, man. Exactly. I'm building relationships or
00:47:58.96 --> 00:48:05.76 whatever. Yeah. Let me tell you what the huge difference is. And there's a huge difference. In that
00:48:05.76 --> 00:48:10.80 game, you're playing the game to win for yourself. Yeah. And when I'm talking about, and this is a,
00:48:10.80 --> 00:48:15.92 this is a such a huge part of the way I think that I didn't even talk about it because it's just
00:48:15.92 --> 00:48:20.72 embedded in the way I think. If you're playing the game to further yourself and further your own
00:48:20.72 --> 00:48:24.80 career, it's not going to work for you. Yeah. Because when you play the game like that,
00:48:24.80 --> 00:48:28.88 this is the same thing as like kissing ass. It's the same thing as your, your doing things because you
00:48:28.88 --> 00:48:33.68 want the advantage and people will identify that. If you're making, if you're playing the game so that
00:48:33.68 --> 00:48:38.32 your team can win so that you can accomplish the mission, that's when this works. That's when playing
00:48:38.32 --> 00:48:42.40 the game works. Otherwise, if you're doing it to promote yourself, it's not going to work.
00:48:42.40 --> 00:48:45.84 I need my work once or twice and it might get you one promotion. But everyone that saw you get
00:48:45.84 --> 00:48:49.52 promoted after you kissed us, they're all pissed at you. They're going to undermine you and you're
00:48:49.52 --> 00:48:55.68 going to go down. So interesting about what you just said there is that your absolute right.
00:48:55.68 --> 00:49:00.80 Survivor is like the one guy. So playing the game, I'm playing the game. Any time someone says
00:49:00.80 --> 00:49:04.48 that, hey, I'm playing the game. They do it in this context where it's like, and that's okay,
00:49:04.48 --> 00:49:08.56 we're here. It's a game. So it's acceptable. I'm playing the game. But they'll always say it
00:49:09.28 --> 00:49:16.40 in excuse for lying to someone or backstabbing someone and it's so weird how that, you're exactly
00:49:16.40 --> 00:49:20.72 right. That's the nature of the game. So when you play the game in this condying, and at work or the
00:49:20.72 --> 00:49:24.40 way you're talking about, it's always a good thing. It's always a good thing. It's always looking
00:49:24.40 --> 00:49:29.44 out for the long as you're doing it for the team. Yeah, it's a good thing. There's people that
00:49:29.44 --> 00:49:35.04 play the game and they play the game so that they are going to, you know, I just said this 10 times
00:49:35.04 --> 00:49:38.72 like I played a win. But yeah, I played for my team to win. I played for us to be able to accomplish
00:49:38.72 --> 00:49:43.12 the mission. That's why I'm playing the game. Yeah. If you're playing the game so that you can get
00:49:43.12 --> 00:49:47.28 the promotion or that's not, and like I said, it might work once or twice, but it's not going to be
00:49:47.28 --> 00:49:53.04 it's not a long term solution. Yeah. Yeah. That's a strong statement. I guarantee it's not a long
00:49:53.04 --> 00:49:59.84 term solution. Now what if you, now here's an example, just taking this one step further, you could
00:49:59.84 --> 00:50:05.60 play the game to get that one promotion. And then you could go, okay, now I can play the game to
00:50:05.60 --> 00:50:09.84 help the team. But you had to do some maneuvering to get into a spot where you could help. That's a trick
00:50:09.84 --> 00:50:15.12 you want because people still think you're a jerk because of what you did. But then you get there
00:50:15.12 --> 00:50:18.40 and it's going to take you a long time to build that trust back up because you maneuvered and
00:50:18.40 --> 00:50:21.60 you got collateral damage around there. Yeah. It's not a good thing. It's hard to clean up that
00:50:21.60 --> 00:50:26.64 collateral damage. Yeah, man. So you can't always do it actually. Yeah, careful. You know how you
00:50:26.64 --> 00:50:30.72 say you'll lose a battle to win the war kind of thing. So now in your little example, right there,
00:50:30.72 --> 00:50:36.48 you're like you lost a battle to win a little mini war to essentially lose a bigger battle to win
00:50:36.48 --> 00:50:41.68 a bigger war. You can say that all this little, it's just I can just do you sacrifice a position
00:50:41.68 --> 00:50:45.76 because you know you're going to end up with the area of the game that you're really good at.
00:50:45.76 --> 00:50:49.28 Yeah. Right. I mean, think about pulling art. What's pulling art? Yeah. That's the
00:50:49.28 --> 00:50:54.64 you're sacrificing being on the bottom because you're good at it. Yeah. For a bigger victory.
00:50:57.20 --> 00:51:01.12 This game goes deep, man. This stuff goes deep indeed.
00:51:01.12 --> 00:51:07.28 Wait, the game. All right. Next question. Hey, Jockel. I'll be heading to
00:51:07.28 --> 00:51:15.44 Marines OCS soon. And I know how crucial leadership is for success at OCS. TBS and
00:51:15.44 --> 00:51:19.92 as a Marine. My question is, what happens if you make a decision as a leader that you can
00:51:19.92 --> 00:51:25.68 rationalize at the best as the best decision for the team, but the result is not a good one.
00:51:25.68 --> 00:51:32.24 Well, my superiors want to see that I'm making quality decisions or producing the best results.
00:51:35.84 --> 00:51:40.08 I know good decisions usually lead to good results, but when it doesn't, what's the next best
00:51:40.08 --> 00:51:45.28 way to handle that situation? Well, under evaluation at OCS. Well, like you said, if you make
00:51:45.28 --> 00:51:49.60 good decisions generally, outcomes will be good. But you, but it is a correct statement that
00:51:49.60 --> 00:51:53.28 sometimes you make good decisions and they have bad outcomes. And in combat, that can definitely
00:51:53.28 --> 00:51:57.20 happen if you decide to go left instead of right. If you look to the left and you look to the
00:51:57.20 --> 00:52:02.32 right and the left has better cover than the right. And so you go to the left and then the
00:52:02.32 --> 00:52:07.84 the enemy happened to be, happened to have mortar styled in that area. And so as you go to the
00:52:07.84 --> 00:52:14.80 left, even though there's better cover, you get overhead fire, indirect fire, and people get blown up,
00:52:14.80 --> 00:52:19.20 people get killed. That may have been a good decision, but the result was bad. And there's no
00:52:19.20 --> 00:52:26.96 way you could have known that. So what do you do in those situations? You made the best decision
00:52:26.96 --> 00:52:31.60 that you could with the information that you had at the time, and it turned out to be a bad result.
00:52:31.60 --> 00:52:39.76 As a matter of fact, in a body, when they had a phrase to describe if someone took a shot
00:52:40.32 --> 00:52:45.12 at what they presumed was a bad guy, but it turned out to be, let's say a civilian,
00:52:45.12 --> 00:52:50.80 they would say, and they would investigate heavily to find out what happened. And
00:52:51.76 --> 00:52:56.40 depending on the situation and what happened most of the time, they would call good shot bad
00:52:56.40 --> 00:53:04.08 result, meaning a soldier, marine, someone was looking down a street and they see something and
00:53:04.08 --> 00:53:09.60 they see something suspicious. And then they see an actual, individual out there,
00:53:09.60 --> 00:53:18.24 carrying out enemy tactics, techniques, or procedures. And they judge the situation to the
00:53:18.24 --> 00:53:22.96 best of their ability and an all-vassant pressure arises, and he sees something else that also
00:53:22.96 --> 00:53:28.72 is enemy activity or enemy procedures. And then he's a friendly force approaching and he's like,
00:53:28.72 --> 00:53:32.48 okay, these guys are in danger. I got to do something, takes a shot. And it turns out that what
00:53:32.48 --> 00:53:37.28 the person was doing once they investigate, someone goes and sees what the person was doing,
00:53:37.28 --> 00:53:42.64 they were doing something that was not nefarious. It just didn't happen a lot, but it definitely
00:53:42.64 --> 00:53:50.64 definitely happened. And so the the term that they would use would be good shot bad result.
00:53:51.60 --> 00:53:56.64 And as long as the, as long as there was logic to the decision that was being made,
00:53:56.96 --> 00:54:01.60 and the people that the person that took the shot owned it and said, here's what I saw,
00:54:01.60 --> 00:54:09.36 this is the shot that I took. That's what happened. I owned it. And, you know, the upper chain
00:54:09.36 --> 00:54:13.12 of command would then say, okay, well, number one, is there anything we can learn from this?
00:54:13.84 --> 00:54:20.56 Is there anything that we could learn to prevent this from happening again? And if we can,
00:54:20.56 --> 00:54:24.48 then we spread that word until everyone would happen and why it happened. And if there's any
00:54:24.48 --> 00:54:30.32 way to improve the decision making process. Now, the biggest mistake that, so that's what you do,
00:54:30.32 --> 00:54:33.84 you own it, you see what you can learn from it and you move on. And your leadership and your
00:54:33.84 --> 00:54:36.96 instructors are going to see the same thing. They're going to see that you had a logic if you can
00:54:36.96 --> 00:54:42.32 explain why you made a decision. Now, your explanation might be bad. You know, your explanation might
00:54:42.32 --> 00:54:47.04 be bad. You might have prioritized wrong. You might have read the terrain wrong. You might have
00:54:47.04 --> 00:54:53.04 assumed that the enemy was going to do something and they did something else. Those are bad,
00:54:53.04 --> 00:54:56.72 bad things that led to your decision. Those are bad choices. Those are bad assessments. Those are
00:54:56.72 --> 00:55:03.76 mistakes that you made. And so those what led to your logic may be fault, faulted.
00:55:03.76 --> 00:55:09.52 Would that be a, like a dingy against you in a good spot? Yes, it would for wouldn't be a good shot.
00:55:09.52 --> 00:55:18.80 Yeah, because if you said, well, I thought that the guy was, I thought there was a curfew in the
00:55:18.80 --> 00:55:21.92 area. Well, there was no curfew. Why did you not know that? You know what I mean? Like,
00:55:21.92 --> 00:55:27.20 so not a good shot. That's an excuse. Right. That's not a good shot. You took a shot that your logic
00:55:27.20 --> 00:55:32.56 doesn't match up. Yeah. Yeah. But the other big, all right, say the biggest mistake, of course,
00:55:32.56 --> 00:55:37.84 that people make when they make a bad decision or things that don't make sense is that they defend
00:55:37.84 --> 00:55:43.04 them when they blame other people. They blame other circumstances. And that's what they say.
00:55:43.04 --> 00:55:49.20 Well, I wouldn't know and told me. No one told me that that or the, the sergeant was pointing in
00:55:49.20 --> 00:55:53.20 that direction. So that's where I told everyone to go. Like, no, don't do that. Don't
00:55:54.40 --> 00:56:00.96 don't make excuses. Right. Don't make excuses. It's like saying, well, I did a perfect job,
00:56:00.96 --> 00:56:05.28 but the, but the enemy used mortars. And that's out of my control. Like, no, instead of saying,
00:56:05.28 --> 00:56:08.72 so like the first case, like if you, if you went left and said, right, you ended up getting mortars,
00:56:09.28 --> 00:56:13.60 you know, you said, well, the, I didn't expect the enemy to use mortars. That's, that's not my fault.
00:56:13.60 --> 00:56:16.16 Then said, you said, you said, you know what? I should have done a better job assessing the
00:56:16.16 --> 00:56:21.12 mortar for it. And I should have had more space between my troops because that's another thing
00:56:21.12 --> 00:56:25.60 that I screwed up is my troops are too close together. And so we had multiple get wounded with one
00:56:25.60 --> 00:56:30.88 mortar round. That shouldn't have happened. And we could have moved quicker through that area,
00:56:30.88 --> 00:56:34.56 which I failed to do. So those are the things I'm going to fix next time. And there you have it.
00:56:35.68 --> 00:56:40.000 There you have it. Don't make excuses. If you own it and you explain what you can do better,
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.84 the instructor's going to agree and they're going to move on. And if you make excuses,
00:56:43.84 --> 00:56:50.40 the instructors are going to eat you live. And by the way, if you make bad decisions continually
00:56:50.40 --> 00:56:55.92 and you keep owning them, well, let's say you keep making bad decisions. And so you start thinking
00:56:55.92 --> 00:56:59.76 yourself, well, I can't take ownership of this anymore. I'm going to get kicked out of here.
00:57:00.88 --> 00:57:04.40 Well, guess what? So then you start making excuses for him. You're really going to kick out of there.
00:57:05.20 --> 00:57:09.84 You're really going to kick out of there. So that's something to keep in mind. Also, keep in
00:57:09.84 --> 00:57:15.76 mind that the instructors know everything that's happening. They can see so much more than you can.
00:57:15.76 --> 00:57:19.52 And I know this because I was instructor for a lot. I was running the training for a long time.
00:57:19.52 --> 00:57:22.80 You can see so much one of the class, because you go through off to Canada, it's going to
00:57:22.80 --> 00:57:26.88 not allow to look at your food. And when I first, this is what they say, don't look at your food.
00:57:26.88 --> 00:57:30.64 So I sat down the first meal. And I'm like, I'm known to go to know if I'm looking at my food,
00:57:30.64 --> 00:57:34.56 how can they tell? And so I just go and stand down my food. And, ultimately, there's drone
00:57:34.56 --> 00:57:37.12 instructors all over you yelling at you. And the food told you not to look at your food,
00:57:37.12 --> 00:57:42.40 your weak and all that stuff. And I'm thinking how did they know? 13 weeks later, or 12 weeks
00:57:42.40 --> 00:57:48.000 weeks later, at Officer Canada, it's going to your candidate officer, which means you're now
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.04 kind of in between the recruits and the drone instructors. And so you're allowed to walk around
00:57:53.04 --> 00:57:59.12 and you're reinforcing. And you go to the one of the tables where there's 30 recruits sitting there
00:57:59.12 --> 00:58:03.20 or Officer Canada sitting there. And you look down the line. And when someone glances at
00:58:03.20 --> 00:58:09.36 their food for a millisecond, it's completely obvious. It's so completely obvious. You can't hide it.
00:58:09.36 --> 00:58:14.40 I'm talking just their eyes are moved. Yeah, it's so obvious. And that's what it's like with
00:58:14.40 --> 00:58:17.92 everything when you're going through tactical training, the instructors can really see a lot.
00:58:17.92 --> 00:58:22.16 They can't see it that much because it's a little less control. But they can see a lot. And also
00:58:22.16 --> 00:58:25.52 they have things planned and part of the plan is that you're going to fail sometimes. They're going
00:58:25.52 --> 00:58:30.16 to set it up that way. And they want to see how you react to that. They want to see how you handle
00:58:30.16 --> 00:58:34.56 the stress, a number one of an unwindable situation. And then when you fail, how do you react to
00:58:34.56 --> 00:58:39.28 failure itself? Do you just blame your adults? Do you not? You wasn't my fault because that's what you're
00:58:39.28 --> 00:58:46.56 doing. It's going to be problematic. And the last thing I would say to this guy here, do relax a little
00:58:46.56 --> 00:58:52.56 bit, right? Because you haven't even gone to OCS yet. And yet you're fearing judgment. You're fearing
00:58:52.56 --> 00:58:57.20 not being considered to be perfect and you're not going to be perfect. And you're going to be absolutely
00:58:57.20 --> 00:59:04.80 judged. It's okay. Be humble. Do your best. And have a great time. It's awesome. Military training is so fun.
00:59:06.64 --> 00:59:11.52 Interesting. I heard mixed opinions about that. But hey, I'll tell you. You don't like,
00:59:11.52 --> 00:59:17.20 you know why it's easy to see you looking at your food. Why? It's an anatomical thing. When you
00:59:17.20 --> 00:59:23.04 look down your eyelids and eyelashes, all that stuff goes boom, they just shift down and
00:59:23.04 --> 00:59:27.68 super obvious physically to see. Yeah. Yeah. Notice that. If you look side to side, not much,
00:59:27.68 --> 00:59:31.36 only your little eyeball or whatever. But if you look down, but you can't look down without doing
00:59:31.36 --> 00:59:35.68 your eyelids. You're saying, like, you get it. Like, when you look down, your eyelids just
00:59:35.68 --> 00:59:40.80 any eyelashes. All I do is this. It's real obvious. Yeah. Real obvious. It's funny though. Yeah.
00:59:40.80 --> 00:59:45.44 Because I, I the same thing. I thought it was going to get to it. Oh, no, you can't. And it's not like
00:59:45.44 --> 00:59:49.04 you can act like you're looking at something else. And then you can't do that because it's, you know,
00:59:49.04 --> 00:59:54.48 you're going to have to shoot ahead. It was actually for so funny how I got so busted. And how
00:59:54.48 --> 00:59:57.92 cocky I was thinking how how they're going to stop me from looking at my food. I'll just go and
00:59:57.92 --> 01:00:04.64 stand. And they just are on you and like on the other guys. Yeah. And you look down. This is jump on
01:00:04.64 --> 01:00:11.12 it. It's crazy. It's good. I feel like this, this kind of thing may be a good way to look at it.
01:00:11.12 --> 01:00:16.16 And I'm only going on based on kind of what you said. But like any, any decision like situation
01:00:16.16 --> 01:00:18.72 where you're going to okay, I'm going to make the right call or the right, you know,
01:00:20.32 --> 01:00:25.20 tactics or what, you know, to get a certain result or whatever. It's really when you kind of think
01:00:25.20 --> 01:00:30.64 about it or what I do anyway. It, there's always an element of chance. Remember how like okay,
01:00:30.64 --> 01:00:36.16 so I'm going to the post office. Right. I'm driving. There is like okay, so me saying, okay, I'm going
01:00:36.16 --> 01:00:39.60 to go to the go to the safest route to the post office. Let me get there. But boom, I'm going to
01:00:39.60 --> 01:00:45.04 deal with their verb or mail my thing. I'm going to come on. The chance that I get killed in one
01:00:45.04 --> 01:00:52.48 way or another car accident, you know, whatever, whatever is there, very small. But it's still there.
01:00:53.28 --> 01:00:58.000 So, and not to say, you know, not to say the how big or small of the chance these things are. I'm
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.44 just saying there is an element of chance regardless how big or small of something getting in the
01:01:03.44 --> 01:01:07.68 way of your success, even if you make all the right decisions or if you make the wrong decisions,
01:01:07.68 --> 01:01:12.08 there's chance just involved in general. Here, you just maybe think of something that can
01:01:12.08 --> 01:01:16.88 jam people up as you like to say. Sure. And this is something that guys used to say to me.
01:01:17.44 --> 01:01:24.000 And so you need to try and avoid this. People would say, I was trying to make, I was trying to do what
01:01:24.88 --> 01:01:29.76 what I thought you would want me to do. Right. Like I thought that's what you would want to see.
01:01:29.76 --> 01:01:32.88 That's what they'd say. Well, I thought that you would want me to do. I thought that that's
01:01:32.88 --> 01:01:38.16 what you want to see. So, if you start playing that game, like you start assessing what's going on,
01:01:38.16 --> 01:01:42.56 and then you start adding a layer of like what do the instructors want me to do right here.
01:01:42.56 --> 01:01:48.000 Yeah. The chances are that that's not going to turn out well because you're trying to predict what
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.40 you should do is look at what's happening and make the best decision possible from your perspective.
01:01:55.12 --> 01:01:58.56 With the minute you start thinking, they, you know, they just taught a class on
01:01:59.28 --> 01:02:04.24 on breaking contact. They probably want me to break contact right here. So you call a break
01:02:04.24 --> 01:02:07.84 contact and then everyone runs away and then they go, why did you break contact? It was one guy
01:02:07.84 --> 01:02:12.32 with a rifle and you had a 40-man-plotoon. What's wrong with you? And they go, and then, and then what
01:02:12.32 --> 01:02:16.56 you say is, well, I thought you wanted us to know. We want you to run a good tactical situation.
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.56 Yeah. Don't do what people, what you think will people want you to do. Don't do that. Genreally.
01:02:22.56 --> 01:02:27.92 I'm not saying don't weigh it at all because they're teaching you something. But don't be stupid.
01:02:28.48 --> 01:02:32.40 Yeah, don't do stupid. This is a good advice. But yeah, but see, I'm saying,
01:02:32.40 --> 01:02:36.40 know that that chance is always there. Yeah. So it's always judged. And it's weird how like
01:02:37.20 --> 01:02:42.16 when you, when you're successful in something, I don't know, whatever, even like in like life,
01:02:42.16 --> 01:02:47.84 like if you're, you're, you're, I don't know, you're career or something. When you're successful in it,
01:02:47.84 --> 01:02:52.96 you don't really talk about the chance element, you know. But if you're unsuccessful, that's when
01:02:52.96 --> 01:02:57.68 you'll be like, oh, just hey, it's just bad luck. You know, hey, these chance kind of situations
01:02:57.68 --> 01:03:03.68 or whatever. So it seems like, you know, ain't given what you said that his kind of objective or his
01:03:03.68 --> 01:03:09.92 kind of outlook or his way of being when he goes into the situation is, hey, man, sure, there's,
01:03:09.92 --> 01:03:14.40 there's going to be these chance that there's going to be a chance that the result isn't going to
01:03:14.40 --> 01:03:19.52 be that good. There's a chance. And there's a chance that it's me good or whatever, but focus on the decision,
01:03:19.52 --> 01:03:25.84 sound decision making. And then if a half the chance comes or the lock or the probability,
01:03:25.84 --> 01:03:32.48 the improbable situation or whatever, that kind of negates your good decision making with its
01:03:32.48 --> 01:03:36.80 bad result, then hey, man, still focus on your decision making. Don't be like, oh, look,
01:03:37.60 --> 01:03:41.44 where was someone else's thing that I had no control over? Kind of thing. Let me see.
01:03:41.44 --> 01:03:47.68 Sure. Next question. Next question.
01:03:47.68 --> 01:03:55.04 Jock, go in, jujitsu. I telegraphed my moves. When I focus on whatever escape or submission, I'm attempting,
01:03:56.24 --> 01:04:00.72 and it's pretty obvious to whom I'm training with. How do I learn to work on a particular move?
01:04:00.72 --> 01:04:06.32 Well, actually setting up another move at the same time. As sense of this. Yeah, that's a
01:04:06.32 --> 01:04:14.16 so jujitsu. Dave, I request you by the way. Interesting. Yeah. Okay, so good question. And actually
01:04:14.16 --> 01:04:21.60 reveal something pretty cool about jujitsu in many cases in jujitsu, especially like the first
01:04:21.60 --> 01:04:26.64 three to five years of training, and that that's a pretty big span. But what's interesting about
01:04:27.60 --> 01:04:36.08 is that the setups for moves are actually other moves. Right. So, and you actually have to
01:04:36.08 --> 01:04:42.88 attempt the other move legitimately in order for it to work as a setup. So, if you're mounted
01:04:42.88 --> 01:04:47.92 on someone and you want an arm lock somebody, don't grab their arm. That's the telegraph.
01:04:47.92 --> 01:04:54.80 What you do is you go for the choke. And you don't just fake go for the choke. You go for the
01:04:54.80 --> 01:05:01.36 choke. You put those, you dig in, you grab some ghee. You start to attack their neck. And obviously,
01:05:01.36 --> 01:05:06.24 if they don't defend, then you choke them, which is awesome. But you can so you go for the
01:05:06.24 --> 01:05:13.44 choke for real. But if they lift up their arm to defend their neck, which they should do, then
01:05:13.44 --> 01:05:20.08 boom, they are mock exposed and you take it. That's the way it works. And the same thing goes with
01:05:20.08 --> 01:05:25.04 Cameroos. Like the Camira sweep, ghee-teen. You know that combo from the guards, really like a basic one
01:05:25.04 --> 01:05:29.44 that you learn from the gums. Yeah, the bumps sweep, the Camira and the ghee-teen from the guard.
01:05:29.44 --> 01:05:36.64 The defense for each one of those is the setup for the other. And there's so many, you know,
01:05:36.64 --> 01:05:40.32 you just do it. Like that's what you do to it. It's like trying a alarm lock. It's,
01:05:41.36 --> 01:05:46.96 it's just that that's the way it is. You have to commit to the moves. You can't just like,
01:05:46.96 --> 01:05:51.68 if you do a half-hearted attempt to do a sit-up sweep on me, I'm not going to give you the reaction
01:05:51.68 --> 01:05:58.24 that you need to get a ghee-teen on me. Right? Because if you don't push me back hard enough,
01:05:58.24 --> 01:06:00.64 I'm not going to lean forward enough. You're not going to be able to grab my neck. Yeah.
01:06:00.64 --> 01:06:07.52 So it's not going to work. Now, as you progress in Gigiitsu, you're able to start attacking
01:06:07.52 --> 01:06:12.72 other things like, for instance, you can attack someone's balance. As I set up, you can attack
01:06:12.72 --> 01:06:18.24 your base. You can attack their posture. As a setup, you can attack their arm position. So you can
01:06:18.24 --> 01:06:23.68 attack the better you get it. Gigiitsu, you can attack some conceptual things. Dean said something
01:06:23.68 --> 01:06:27.92 like that the other day. I was like, dang, that's smart. What he was saying was he's like, hey,
01:06:28.72 --> 01:06:36.80 he said the person on the bottom can't fall down. Dean said that. Yeah. It's a little bit
01:06:36.80 --> 01:06:41.60 thin. I know it's a little bit. It's a little bit. It's a little bit. Profound. Right? The person on the bottom
01:06:41.60 --> 01:06:46.64 can't fall down. You can't, you can't mess with my balance at all. But I can't mess with you.
01:06:46.64 --> 01:06:49.84 If you're on top, I can mess with your balance. That's one of the key things that I try and
01:06:49.84 --> 01:06:53.60 mess with. Your balance. You can't mess with my balance. I'm on the ground. Yeah.
01:06:55.20 --> 01:07:00.32 Think about that one. Actually, you did say that that Dean said that, but I'm not sure. I don't
01:07:00.32 --> 01:07:05.52 know if you said that. You can't knock me down when I'm on the ground. Yeah. Well, that may be just
01:07:05.52 --> 01:07:14.56 where I put it. But that's true. Let's see. These principles obviously they apply, not only
01:07:14.56 --> 01:07:18.32 Gigiitsu, but they apply to the battlefield and they apply to the business. Because if you
01:07:18.32 --> 01:07:24.96 fake a frontal assault to expose the enemy's flank, but you don't put enough firepower in the
01:07:24.96 --> 01:07:30.48 frontal assault, then the enemy doesn't have to react to it. So they just kind of keep their perimeter
01:07:30.48 --> 01:07:35.60 secure. And then when you flank them, their flank is defended. Yeah. So it's the same exact thing.
01:07:35.60 --> 01:07:42.32 Yeah. You have to commit enough to throw the person to make the person react. If you don't
01:07:42.32 --> 01:07:47.92 give them enough, they're not going to react in the business world. If you come up with a, if you put
01:07:47.92 --> 01:07:54.64 up a new product to contend with your competitor in some market, but the product isn't strong enough
01:07:54.64 --> 01:07:57.92 that it becomes any kind of threat. Well, then the competitors enough to contend with it all.
01:07:58.48 --> 01:08:04.88 And you've actually wasted effort. So if you're going to go, go, go, get the reaction that you need.
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.96 If you're going to execute a move to set up your opponent, it has to be strong enough to
01:08:10.96 --> 01:08:17.04 listen to real reaction. That's what you have to do. Now you could do something that's like a
01:08:17.04 --> 01:08:22.08 little distraction. That's a little different than a setup. Right. You can distract someone.
01:08:22.08 --> 01:08:26.64 Usually the distraction is much more minor than a real setup. I can get you thinking about
01:08:26.64 --> 01:08:32.88 something else while I go over here. Yeah. Not as effective, but it has its times. Yeah.
01:08:34.24 --> 01:08:40.000 Yeah. So interesting. I think Dave worked mentioned that idea to me before. Wait, is this a
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.68 question from Dave's first straight up? Yeah. So, and here's another thing Dave works kind of
01:08:45.68 --> 01:08:51.68 early in the in the game to and which is a good thing because he's thinking about this stuff already.
01:08:52.48 --> 01:08:58.24 But I think generally speaking like these those types of tactics like where I'm going to go
01:08:58.24 --> 01:09:02.16 for this and then when he reacts to that thing, I went for it then I'm going to really do my
01:09:02.16 --> 01:09:06.16 real move kind of thing and there can be chains too, by the way. I can do one thing because that's
01:09:06.16 --> 01:09:10.96 the advantage. And the more you advance two people get when they're really against each other,
01:09:10.96 --> 01:09:17.44 the more that you'll see. So, but being early on or the more that you won't see, I remember when
01:09:17.44 --> 01:09:24.56 Dean and I were training like maniacs, burping and people would watch us and it barely even
01:09:24.56 --> 01:09:28.80 looked like you did to because the movements were so subtle. Like sometimes you wouldn't even like
01:09:28.80 --> 01:09:33.36 I would just feel his weight shift and I would immediately shift my weight and so there's three
01:09:33.36 --> 01:09:38.48 or four offensive and defensive moves that happen and there's barely any movement that's visual
01:09:38.48 --> 01:09:44.24 because it's all in the weight. Yeah. So, when you mean when you don't see it's like it's just so subtle
01:09:44.24 --> 01:09:51.52 that you don't see it can't see it. But it's yeah, Toby still there of course. So that's that's
01:09:51.52 --> 01:09:57.52 kind of good that I think anyway that he's thinking that you know how to do that. But I think what's
01:09:57.52 --> 01:10:02.40 more important given the stage and this is real generally speaking because people are different but
01:10:03.84 --> 01:10:09.44 learn the moves, you know the crisp like move like how to do an arm lock where your hips should
01:10:09.44 --> 01:10:14.08 be and shouldn't be and what makes it an arm lock a good arm lock and when makes an arm lock,
01:10:14.08 --> 01:10:18.56 for example a bad arm lock, you know where it's like you know how some guys can do an arm lock but
01:10:18.56 --> 01:10:22.64 it's like super easy to escape because you have these three details that you just didn't even though
01:10:22.64 --> 01:10:27.12 you know what an arm lock is kind of thing. So, I think I think anyway that when when you start to
01:10:27.12 --> 01:10:34.16 get those things down you're like a brown belt no. Yeah, all the yeah yeah yeah he's got a good
01:10:34.16 --> 01:10:37.52 arm lock. Yeah you got it you're gonna watch out for that thing but he's an example of like
01:10:38.24 --> 01:10:41.92 his arm lock is really good and everyone's got the really good moves. Yeah yeah that's a good
01:10:41.92 --> 01:10:47.12 example and when when you get and you know have full of those down or you're just your general
01:10:47.12 --> 01:10:54.16 game down in that particular way then you can start like leaking into that kind of way thinking
01:10:54.16 --> 01:10:59.36 where it's like okay I'm gonna go for this arm lock you know and then I'm not sure I 100% disagree
01:10:59.36 --> 01:11:04.56 with you because in my mind if you don't set things up they're not gonna work. Yeah so you have to
01:11:04.56 --> 01:11:08.64 set them up and you have to start learning where that set up looks like. Yeah but as I mean Dave
01:11:08.64 --> 01:11:12.88 works at that position right now this this the moves are not working because he's not setting
01:11:12.88 --> 01:11:17.76 them up because he's telegrafting him. Yeah so yeah that's why he's asking the question. Yeah so
01:11:17.76 --> 01:11:23.68 when you this is the this is the answer to when that question comes which it will when you start
01:11:23.68 --> 01:11:28.72 training GJitsu and you start training against people that know what you know or at least some of
01:11:28.72 --> 01:11:33.76 what you know they're gonna defend. Yeah and it's proper that they defend because their defense
01:11:33.76 --> 01:11:39.20 is a setup for your next move. Yeah that's the part you got to realize. Yeah so considered
01:11:39.20 --> 01:11:44.48 and when he asked me this before or when he talked about African-to-exactly when it was I was
01:11:44.48 --> 01:11:50.72 considering it through his point of view right or and with an expert okay so but this point of
01:11:50.72 --> 01:11:54.88 you and my point of view so if I'm rolling with a white belt and like a real new white belt and
01:11:54.88 --> 01:12:00.40 he's doing the move that they learn that day so he's doing it step by step by the way he learned
01:12:00.40 --> 01:12:04.32 and I'm like okay this is this that's the ultimate in telegrafting by the way when you're looking
01:12:04.32 --> 01:12:07.92 at the steps that you just watched them learn kind of thing. You might even have dotted to him
01:12:08.88 --> 01:12:14.08 so when they do that it's I think that's appropriate as far as the learning process early on it's
01:12:14.08 --> 01:12:18.88 like yeah get those down. Yeah practice that part of it yeah it's not gonna work it in fact it might
01:12:18.88 --> 01:12:24.80 work on another super new new guy. Yeah and and you I know I've rolled with guys Dean is one of them
01:12:25.76 --> 01:12:31.68 where he you know what he's gonna do. Yeah you know what he's gonna do. He might as well tell you
01:12:31.68 --> 01:12:36.96 yeah what he's gonna do and and he's gonna do it. Yeah now sometimes you give up like you give up
01:12:36.96 --> 01:12:41.60 an inch and all of a sudden you feel it and you go oh man I'm gonna my arm is exposed. Yeah and
01:12:41.60 --> 01:12:45.44 you and you spend the next two minutes defending that arm and there's nothing you can do to stop it
01:12:45.44 --> 01:12:51.20 right but in I think we both know that that's so much different in this way because if Dean's like
01:12:51.20 --> 01:12:56.80 okay man that's so multi-dimensional compared to like a white belt telegrafting his moves because Dean
01:12:56.80 --> 01:13:01.12 okay Dean for example he's black I'm gonna get mount and I'm gonna do armor. So him getting mount
01:13:01.12 --> 01:13:07.36 is gonna be all these little micro like things in there. Yeah. Not to mention the psychological
01:13:07.36 --> 01:13:13.28 war that he just waged on you and he's ahead by the way. So you got that and then you got all these
01:13:13.28 --> 01:13:16.80 little things where he goes for mount he's just gonna he's just gonna get mount so to get mount
01:13:16.80 --> 01:13:21.76 you got to do a certain you know thing in his case so when he does those things that's gonna
01:13:21.76 --> 01:13:24.80 be a bunch of those things that you're talking about all this thing I'm gonna fake this side but
01:13:24.80 --> 01:13:28.72 then I'm gonna go this side I'm gonna shift my weight so he shifts his weight that way so he
01:13:28.72 --> 01:13:34.16 so I go here so he so there's little many things but he's just so good at it that he'll do he can
01:13:34.16 --> 01:13:38.88 just do it like that true so I think I mean again the the point there is like it's it's a lot
01:13:38.88 --> 01:13:44.16 different with a guy who Dean when he says I'm gonna get mount and I'm an armbar you he's not
01:13:44.16 --> 01:13:48.48 telegraphy anything he's telling you sure but he's not technically telegraphy like like
01:13:48.48 --> 01:13:52.64 all my belt situation but either way I get it either way I mean everyone's different
01:13:52.64 --> 01:13:57.12 I do think that learning those steps and learning what a good I think getting that part down
01:13:57.12 --> 01:14:03.60 early on early on is is I think more foundational it's foundational once you start asking the
01:14:03.60 --> 01:14:08.56 question why won't anyone tap to my moves I need to set them up better here you go yeah
01:14:08.56 --> 01:14:12.88 yes I think you're right about that that's right you know to your point how you get when you
01:14:12.88 --> 01:14:16.56 want to do so it's kind of like a faint right in boxing maybe a little bit more like how you say
01:14:16.56 --> 01:14:21.68 I'm gonna when I go for a move as this as a set up move you got to really sell that move you got
01:14:21.68 --> 01:14:25.92 a really big going for that so it's like bait right yeah in fact you ever watch the movie
01:14:25.92 --> 01:14:32.48 bait no okay so bait is moving with Jamie Fox and you know some other people anyway so one of the
01:14:32.48 --> 01:14:38.72 guys it's it's long so I don't want to so they're trying to catch this did this gold thief right in
01:14:38.72 --> 01:14:44.72 bit so this gold thief it but he's a real genius computer nerd gold thief and he's super good at
01:14:44.72 --> 01:14:51.20 hiding the way you pronounce that you're like gold thief I was like okay this is a guy that's
01:14:51.20 --> 01:14:56.64 gold he's a criminal but he's like a computer guy you know he's a super genius easy like hides
01:14:56.64 --> 01:15:03.12 really well and super hard to find and all this and so the guy at the FBI guy whoever you know the
01:15:03.12 --> 01:15:09.76 the law enforcement dude he's like hey we got to set some bait so this guy comes out and gets the
01:15:09.76 --> 01:15:15.60 bait but when you set bait you can't be some fake thing and this bait has to be real like a
01:15:15.60 --> 01:15:19.44 wall you know when you try to catch a wolf the bait has to be real there can't be just some
01:15:19.44 --> 01:15:25.92 bait you bought kind of kind of idea so you know so the idea of the movie is they get this guy
01:15:25.92 --> 01:15:30.96 Jamie Fox and they make him the bait but he doesn't know he's the bait because he has to be
01:15:30.96 --> 01:15:35.60 real has to be he can be tainted with the human scent he got to be a real live piece of bait so
01:15:35.60 --> 01:15:39.76 that's essentially what your move's got to be absolutely you got to be like hey look if my bait is
01:15:39.76 --> 01:15:45.76 the armlock if I'm going to bait the kymura to get the sit-up sweep that kymura got to be a fresh
01:15:45.76 --> 01:15:51.60 plucked out of the wild kymura attempt and then when he goes and reacts to it or bites it
01:15:52.64 --> 01:15:57.28 pull my get the sit-up sweep same exact thing so yeah they got to the the set up
01:15:57.28 --> 01:16:05.92 move got a smell real got a smell real. that's how I like to keep on my moves smelling super real
01:16:05.92 --> 01:16:18.08 you seem same check all right next question does discipline ever fail you does discipline ever fail you
01:16:22.40 --> 01:16:33.12 no actually discipline does not fail me I fail discipline that's what happens on days where I
01:16:33.12 --> 01:16:42.40 wear off the path and on to the slippery slope of weakness it isn't disciplines fault
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:52.80 it's my fault I'm the one that's being weak I'm the one that's not holding the line I'm the one
01:16:52.80 --> 01:17:00.000 that is deciding to take the short term gratification instead of a long term domination
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:08.80 when laziness or e-p-send it's not it's not discipline that open the door
01:17:11.04 --> 01:17:19.52 it's me it's me rationalizing and explaining and justifying that laziness
01:17:21.60 --> 01:17:29.44 when I decide to take the easy path instead of the righteous path of discipline that is my
01:17:29.44 --> 01:17:37.92 decision that's all on me it's me deciding to cave to my weaknesses and become a slave to them
01:17:41.44 --> 01:17:52.08 and when I make that error when I let discipline down there's only one thing to do and that's
01:17:52.08 --> 01:18:01.36 get back on the path get back on it and then step it up and go harder and push more and
01:18:02.40 --> 01:18:13.92 pay for your transgressions cleanse yourself in the fire and the suffering of the discipline
01:18:13.92 --> 01:18:23.28 and get back on the path the hard unrelenting path of discipline that path that leads
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:40.32 to freedom and I think that's all I've got for tonight so echo yes speaking of the
01:18:40.32 --> 01:18:48.16 path against weakness sure you know anyways it maybe you could help us down that path yeah
01:18:48.96 --> 01:18:55.36 first I will talk about our company origin okay what origin does a lot of stuff
01:18:56.64 --> 01:19:02.40 actually impressive stuff first thing they do maybe not the first thing but one of the many things they
01:19:02.40 --> 01:19:10.24 do is I guess technically it's origin labs right yeah so jocca some supplements jocca super
01:19:10.24 --> 01:19:17.12 krill oil and joint warfare from origin labs these supplements are for your joints and of course
01:19:17.12 --> 01:19:23.84 they are the best ones for your joints unless you made one that or not is not the best for your joints
01:19:23.84 --> 01:19:30.24 no we think you're one's had the best one right yeah yes indeed yeah someone tweeted at me I think
01:19:30.24 --> 01:19:35.20 that's the you tweet at someone okay that's the thing anyway so they're like hey I ran out of
01:19:35.20 --> 01:19:40.08 joint warfare big mistake yeah and it was kind of like just kind of expressing himself I mean I did
01:19:40.08 --> 01:19:47.04 it because I've done that too so you get on the the subscription deal yeah I think you did yeah lots of
01:19:47.04 --> 01:19:56.88 that's a the joint warfare in the krill oil like try it if you if you if you if you have any
01:19:56.88 --> 01:20:03.12 joint issues at all try it seriously try it it will help you yeah it will absolutely help you
01:20:03.12 --> 01:20:09.84 which is awesome yeah and part of that which I did mention I think maybe last time there's anti-inflammatory
01:20:09.84 --> 01:20:14.64 stuff in there too like natural stuff not like ibuprofen something like that like anti-inflammatory
01:20:14.64 --> 01:20:21.92 so so that helps a lot and you know I'm rarely like super impressed with I mean not like my
01:20:21.92 --> 01:20:26.80 standard just so high I'm just saying like I understand supplements are like there supplements cool I
01:20:26.80 --> 01:20:32.72 dig it kind of thing but this is one that I was like this is this is an important one 100%
01:20:32.72 --> 01:20:40.40 door and out just don't don't run out also discipline discipline is a what we are calling officially
01:20:40.40 --> 01:20:49.04 a pre-mission supplement so whatever your mission is physical mental emotional sure
01:20:49.04 --> 01:20:54.88 but there's a thing called emotional intelligence I don't have emotions so I can't yeah you
01:20:54.88 --> 01:21:00.000 can't talk about that one I don't know the effects good point put it this way I have never lost my
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:09.36 temper I have never broke down and cried well the beautiful while I'm on the discipline there you go
01:21:09.36 --> 01:21:15.92 so the proof is in the pudding so it is an emotional enhancing situation as well but whatever your mission
01:21:15.92 --> 01:21:21.28 is there's some neutral pick stuff in there for cognitive enhancement and a little bit of caffeine
01:21:21.28 --> 01:21:27.92 if you're into caffeine a little bit micro dose as we call it you know that's a good one too don't
01:21:27.92 --> 01:21:37.04 run out also moke moke is moke I had some other day two scoops what is one serving one
01:21:37.04 --> 01:21:42.88 one scoop yeah one serving one scoop moke protein powder you know okay we'll we'll we'll say
01:21:42.88 --> 01:21:48.56 protein but you will definitely technically yeah it is right then you realize that technically
01:21:48.56 --> 01:21:54.56 what it really is is moke yeah you know what it is I'll tell you what you mix it with milk of course
01:21:54.56 --> 01:22:02.72 100% yeah what do you mix it with water like a cycle probably try to water them no it's actually
01:22:02.72 --> 01:22:08.32 like I said the other day it's not bad with water it's not bad it's like satisfying it's a ham sandwich
01:22:08.32 --> 01:22:12.88 but it's not it's not in charge of milkshake style yeah yeah like like I'm cracking out
01:22:12.88 --> 01:22:20.80 dandy right when you was like music yeah you could live off it or you know I have no idea what
01:22:20.80 --> 01:22:25.36 you're saying like sure it's fine with the other one no you're talking about I don't forget what
01:22:25.36 --> 01:22:30.000 it's talking about I recommend yeah the milk and you know what else if you're let's say you're
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.80 lactose intolerant I'm in milk no no problem all the milk is also awesome all the
01:22:34.80 --> 01:22:39.84 although they do make lactose free milk no which is very similar tasting to regular milk like
01:22:39.84 --> 01:22:45.92 surprisingly similar because I accidentally bought some before and I was drinking I was like
01:22:45.92 --> 01:22:51.12 oh the cool but I was like does this taste different like you know it's like a question it's not
01:22:51.12 --> 01:22:56.16 guaranteed it could have been me I maybe I brushed my teeth too soon before I drank the milk you
01:22:56.16 --> 01:23:01.60 know something like this foul nobody see it you can do certain things that affects your
01:23:01.60 --> 01:23:06.48 little taste buds or whatever it was like that it was like it was a question mark it wasn't like
01:23:06.48 --> 01:23:11.92 dang I bought the wrong milk like if you think you're drinking I don't know regular milk but then
01:23:11.92 --> 01:23:17.60 it's like soy milk or canned milk or powder milk that can be added because it wouldn't be in my house
01:23:18.96 --> 01:23:23.12 in the rest of us you know the difference that's the point you know the different
01:23:23.12 --> 01:23:29.04 lactose free milk and regular milk like the difference isn't that obvious in my opinion yeah
01:23:29.04 --> 01:23:32.96 yeah if you're lactose intolerant but more nonetheless technically it's protein powder you don't this
01:23:32.96 --> 01:23:38.24 is why you don't like to say protein powder yeah and we have right now we only have mint but we have
01:23:38.24 --> 01:23:48.24 we have peanut butter coming it's gonna be the one yeah check this is what I'm
01:23:48.24 --> 01:23:54.24 chocolate peanut butter by the way yeah okay and the mint isn't mint it's mint chocolate yeah
01:23:54.24 --> 01:23:58.88 so yeah so protein powder makes it sound what I'm saying before the protein powder makes
01:23:58.88 --> 01:24:02.88 it sound like oh it's just one of these many protein powders that are out there kind of thing
01:24:02.88 --> 01:24:06.56 that's the feeling yeah that's not the feeling you get when you drink it yeah it's a
01:24:06.56 --> 01:24:11.84 way different if it would have not been milk we would have called it protein powder yeah
01:24:11.84 --> 01:24:20.24 it was protein powder with the with the umo yeah yeah I thought that was like some Viking thing
01:24:20.24 --> 01:24:25.28 the way you're having it okay hard core heavy metal to heavy metal like when you go to this
01:24:25.28 --> 01:24:30.24 it's like this yeah and no it's your cold this one the first the first album that had it was
01:24:30.24 --> 01:24:34.40 blue it's your cold and then probably the most the most famous that has the disc motorhead
01:24:35.20 --> 01:24:40.80 and that's because the two fingers you know like rock on and I I Reese before I released this I
01:24:40.80 --> 01:24:47.28 researched it this how I know this and and lemme from motorheads quote as to why he used the
01:24:47.28 --> 01:24:53.68 emote was because he said it looks mean that's his quote that's always said yeah no big philosophical
01:24:53.68 --> 01:24:58.88 representation of like while they represent eyes there's no no there's a layer there's a layer
01:24:58.88 --> 01:25:04.64 there's a layer yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
01:25:04.64 --> 01:25:08.80 yeah it doesn't look mean sounds cool to me lemme yeah and then now it's on the mok those
01:25:08.80 --> 01:25:13.60 layers that's layers so you've provided another layer it has been turned into layers and also
01:25:13.60 --> 01:25:18.32 you know you know how you say rock like I said well this is what I thought you know when
01:25:18.32 --> 01:25:21.76 you say rock on and you have the two fingers right point index finger and then you know
01:25:21.76 --> 01:25:25.68 in the pinky boom rock on if you were to I don't know why people don't say rock on any
01:25:25.68 --> 01:25:31.52 boy I don't know about I'm not in the scene so you know you do that motion and let's say you had
01:25:31.52 --> 01:25:35.60 some I don't know some chalk or something on your hand uh from doing deadlift or something like this
01:25:35.60 --> 01:25:39.20 and then you touch the wall boom you got your own luck right there that's what I thought it for real
01:25:39.20 --> 01:25:45.28 what that's interesting my name is echo you're gonna be the way to creative or your mind is wondering
01:25:45.28 --> 01:25:49.36 a little too much I think other people might have thought that too think about this okay my name is echo
01:25:49.36 --> 01:25:55.28 obviously it's my real name by the way I have a twin brother named Jade he's older by 15 minutes
01:25:55.28 --> 01:26:02.16 I'm the second twin right yeah follow so my first great teacher was she said oh yeah your
01:26:02.16 --> 01:26:07.84 name's echo that makes sense now because you're your brother's echo yeah seems seen now it's like
01:26:07.84 --> 01:26:15.04 dang that is man my parents are smart yeah no I thought that too yeah yeah so I go home
01:26:15.04 --> 01:26:20.16 and I asked and my mom was like wow no not at all I just thought it was cool same thing is lemme
01:26:20.16 --> 01:26:26.40 yeah same exact thing she thought it was mean no not mean just just cool and how should I say like
01:26:26.40 --> 01:26:33.12 you foric my mom was happy anyway back to the market still peanut butter chocolate not out yet
01:26:33.12 --> 01:26:39.84 but we'll be out soon look forward to that one big time also strangely are you is peanut butter
01:26:39.84 --> 01:26:48.24 chocolate your second favorite flavor um I don't know it's peats by the way it's right up there yeah
01:26:48.24 --> 01:26:53.12 yeah and it's mine by the way peats sent me like a text when he first got the peanut butter one
01:26:54.08 --> 01:27:00.48 and I can tell that he was real fired up yeah no he was he had a real strength he's like
01:27:00.48 --> 01:27:05.44 just mix this up you know it's like a little thing just mix this up only you know you see the
01:27:05.44 --> 01:27:13.52 thing leave the screen and then he slams it back down bro so that's a good signer yeah yeah
01:27:13.52 --> 01:27:17.84 I mean it's kind of a pain because then he has to take it and because he only give you one sample
01:27:17.84 --> 01:27:23.28 so then he fed x is like Fed x I'm like sending me the rest so it's in route you gotta break it up like
01:27:23.28 --> 01:27:30.80 um like in little bags so good you see yeah so be on the lookout for that if you care if you if you
01:27:30.80 --> 01:27:37.44 want some more be on the lookout for that also geese and rash cards that's what origin has again
01:27:37.44 --> 01:27:42.64 origin main dot com this stuff is all made in America by the way side note where's that even side
01:27:42.64 --> 01:27:47.12 note yeah that's the note straight up note note this all this made in prayer so geese and rash
01:27:47.12 --> 01:27:50.40 cards geese okay why is that relevant because we're talking about you just to you today everyone's
01:27:50.40 --> 01:27:57.28 still not everyone people still ask me weekly maybe even bi weekly what geese should I get
01:27:58.80 --> 01:28:03.92 point me in a direction of a good geese here there's all do it i'll do it right now origin geese
01:28:04.48 --> 01:28:09.36 whichever one you want whichever two you want whichever three yeah there's people i people that missed
01:28:09.36 --> 01:28:15.20 the original def ghee the discipline was freedom ghee yeah that says good after on the on the
01:28:15.20 --> 01:28:20.64 tail sure it's called the skirt i thought it's called the skirt the tail anyways the back of the
01:28:20.64 --> 01:28:28.32 the back of the ghee top on the bottom it says good after but they originally made those or we
01:28:28.32 --> 01:28:37.12 originally made those as a like you know kind of like a what's it but yeah yeah yeah no just uh
01:28:37.12 --> 01:28:43.20 what's that word like special only yeah special edition yeah special edition
01:28:43.20 --> 01:28:50.32 anyways but everyone liked them and so now they're part of the part of the line yeah and
01:28:50.32 --> 01:28:55.68 put a line up yeah good yeah i noticed the white one is available now and so is the black
01:28:55.68 --> 01:28:59.60 okay they're both up boom whatever color you want also another question people asked about the
01:28:59.60 --> 01:29:05.60 geese they're like hey what color should i get like is it crazy to get a green gear something like this
01:29:05.60 --> 01:29:10.88 right you know the two people ask you that still yeah sometimes yes people seem to come to you
01:29:10.88 --> 01:29:15.92 more for geese it's probably more of a fashion like thing that said they go to you maybe and well
01:29:15.92 --> 01:29:21.20 yeah well the origin geese looked up to by the way and that's not just because you mentioned fashion
01:29:21.20 --> 01:29:25.60 they do that's like one of the one of the what pizza got a little fashion street again yes he does you
01:29:25.60 --> 01:29:29.68 know like that actually no that's good that he does because you don't yeah i don't know if you
01:29:29.68 --> 01:29:34.40 compliment no fashion street my fashion street gives t-shirts yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
01:29:34.40 --> 01:29:39.68 t-shirt in other words no fashion street nonetheless the colors of the geese are going to
01:29:39.68 --> 01:29:45.20 depend on your instructor or your academy true so these you know like if your academy allows
01:29:45.20 --> 01:29:51.04 whatever color geese want like victory does then you whatever color you want then you kind of
01:29:51.04 --> 01:29:56.40 go into this game with it the game which actually doesn't really exist really and that's like
01:29:56.40 --> 01:30:02.56 if you're a new guy and you show up with a pink geek or a crazy like you know those weird geese
01:30:02.56 --> 01:30:06.32 and a gold belt or something like how Jeff clevery so where that gold belt or was it friend
01:30:06.32 --> 01:30:12.32 you did that they bought it anyway bill cooper even if you do that then it's like hey you know
01:30:12.32 --> 01:30:18.88 but this more that's more of like social fabric kind of thing but if it comes onto the the
01:30:18.88 --> 01:30:25.28 the school so some rigid schools only white yeah some rigid schools and then the more traditional
01:30:25.28 --> 01:30:31.92 it's like white or blue that's it don't do a green don't do a black what you're cool in my opinion
01:30:31.92 --> 01:30:37.04 and then you get the schools where like I'm whatever and maybe this in between I never heard of
01:30:37.04 --> 01:30:41.52 any but maybe this in between so pointer as your instructor well color then boom get that color
01:30:41.52 --> 01:30:47.36 originmate dot com that's the deal also rash guards on there good rash guards by the way

01:34:48.72 --> 01:34:55.28 probably since like a college time but I mean yeah that's not a family work but I'm just seeing it's
01:34:55.28 --> 01:34:59.76 far as like what I did today think about it's hot so nice to have a tank top on yeah yeah I did
01:34:59.76 --> 01:35:07.68 get angry so yeah so tank tops yeah be on look I always find it not strange but I always don't want
01:35:07.68 --> 01:35:11.84 to say be on the lookout for that like it's this big thing you gotta be on the lookout but kind you
01:35:11.84 --> 01:35:17.04 know if you're down for the tank tops hey be on the lookout for it I guess right sure
01:35:17.04 --> 01:35:20.64 then let's jocco store dot com and get some patches I got some warrior kid patches
01:35:21.92 --> 01:35:27.92 I got this will those should be on there right now actually for the warrior kids and the
01:35:27.92 --> 01:35:32.96 geese and the geese the backpack wherever you want to put down you don't represent where your
01:35:32.96 --> 01:35:38.48 kids also other patches on there too discipline equals freedom what not also psychological warfare
01:35:38.48 --> 01:35:44.72 if you didn't know what that is it's an album with tracks jocco tracks that help you through
01:35:44.72 --> 01:35:49.04 every moment of weakness that you might come across can not because apparently not all of us
01:35:49.04 --> 01:35:54.88 go through moments of weakness it's rare but some people they just power through for those types
01:35:54.88 --> 01:35:59.68 of people psychological warfare not for them I think I think they just power through and continue
01:35:59.68 --> 01:36:05.28 powering through maybe even teach us how to just power through but for the rest of us hit
01:36:05.28 --> 01:36:10.08 moments of weakness we listen to psychological warfare given what the weakness is so if my weakness
01:36:10.08 --> 01:36:16.96 is hitting the snooze and not getting up early there's a track for that it's jocco on that
01:36:16.96 --> 01:36:22.32 track talking to you telling you why you should get up not yelling he's playing the game quote
01:36:22.32 --> 01:36:27.28 unquote actually he's not technically playing the game on a track he's just flanking
01:36:27.28 --> 01:36:32.24 it's not a no yeah just explain pragmatically like why the value you could say that
01:36:32.80 --> 01:36:37.04 it is a little bit of a flank going on because it's getting everyone that listens to like it hits
01:36:37.04 --> 01:36:42.72 the spot right yes it nails the target yeah of why because I know where the weakness comes from
01:36:42.72 --> 01:36:48.72 it happens to me yeah and so I just talk about how you just over that thing yeah ha ha because technically
01:36:48.72 --> 01:36:55.60 the very reason or by the very nature of you wanting to stay in bed that's by it's very nature
01:36:55.60 --> 01:37:00.48 a reinforced position because you're rationalizing in your head you're defending your actions
01:37:00.48 --> 01:37:04.24 or your potential actions you're defending that already in your own head so you're going to
01:37:04.24 --> 01:37:09.76 jocco on the jocco track you don't attack those things you just come around and say hey
01:37:09.76 --> 01:37:15.36 hey I take it you know the bed is I dig it you know all this stuff you fight it's good
01:37:15.36 --> 01:37:20.56 and there's a track for all these little weaknesses good 100% effectiveness by the way
01:37:20.56 --> 01:37:25.76 get it on iTunes or wherever wherever you can buy MP3 it's on like Amazon music whatnot as well
01:37:25.76 --> 01:37:30.40 yeah well speaking of Amazon if you want to get something called jocco white tea you can get that
01:37:30.40 --> 01:37:34.96 on Amazon you should only get it if you want to have an 8,000 pound dead lift because that's what
01:37:34.96 --> 01:37:45.12 it results in otherwise drink some other tea you now this is cool we have jocco white tea in a can
01:37:45.76 --> 01:37:54.96 coming out in June on Amazon get some obviously the goal is to eventually get them out at
01:37:54.96 --> 01:38:01.12 retail so you can have that option everywhere you go instead of drinking the junk energy drinks
01:38:01.12 --> 01:38:09.52 that are bad for you so yeah I'll let y'all know when it hits Amazon it's been made by the way if
01:38:09.52 --> 01:38:15.28 you're wondering a ton of it a bunch of it way more than a ton actually a lot of it has been made
01:38:16.56 --> 01:38:21.60 because I think well I know I want it so it worst case scenario I have a lifetime supply of
01:38:21.60 --> 01:38:28.32 jocco white tea in a can and you know I don't know what is well there's a little debate you know
01:38:28.32 --> 01:38:33.68 what you call it you know wait what you call what the jocco white tea because I was kind of thinking
01:38:33.68 --> 01:38:38.64 well there's another name we could give it we could call it 8,000 pound dead lift and it can
01:38:39.92 --> 01:38:43.60 sure yes but no we're still calling it jocco white tea in books
01:38:43.60 --> 01:38:52.56 way the warrior kid tons the series right there's two books out right now and so much awesome
01:38:52.56 --> 01:38:58.64 feedback on that it's awesome thanks for posting pictures of your kids studying reading doing book

01:39:33.36 --> 01:39:37.36 read one section of the field manual a day I know it doesn't rhyme but it actually works
01:39:37.36 --> 01:39:44.96 it doesn't it'll keep you on track physically and mentally and if you want to speak
01:39:44.96 --> 01:39:49.92 of tracks you want to listen to it there's no audio audible version of it because we wanted
01:39:49.92 --> 01:39:59.92 to have an album with tracks you can get it on amazon news at google play iTunes other MP3
01:39:59.92 --> 01:40:07.60 platforms the discipline equals field the discipline equals freedom field manual meditate on that
